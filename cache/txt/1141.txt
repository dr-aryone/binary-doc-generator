  
 Several therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) exist, although there is no known cure. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). 
 The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS. 
 The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. 
 This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; borderline forms of MS have particular treatments that are excluded. 
 [edit] Management of acute attacks 
 Administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established efficacy in promoting a faster recovery from disability after an attack.[1][2] There is however insufficient evidence to indicate any significant impact on long-term disability of corticosteroid treatments.[3] Steroids administered orally have a similar effectiveness and safety profile at treating MS symptoms as intravenous treatment.[4] Consequences of severe attacks which do not respond to corticosteroids might be treated by plasmapheresis.[5] 
 [edit] Disease-modifying treatments 
 As of January 2013, seven disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the Japanese PMDA. 
 The approved drugs with their trademarks are interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif, CinnoVex, ReciGen), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), natalizumab (Tysabri), fingolimod (Gilenya), and teriflunomide (Aubagio).[5][6][7] 
 [edit] Description of the drugs 
 In 1993 interferon beta-1b was the first drug to ever be approved for MS, being soon followed by interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate.[8] Interferon beta-1a is injected either weekly or three times a week depending on commercial formulations,[9][10] while interferon beta-1b is injected every second day.[11] Interferon-beta balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the blood brain barrier.[12] Overall, therapy with interferon-beta leads to a reduction of neuron inflammation.[12] Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of nerve growth factor and consequently improve neuronal survival.[12] Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of polypeptides injected daily that leads to complex inmunomodulatory changes in the innate and adaptive immune systems.[13][14] Mitoxantrone is an immunosuppressant also used in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000;[15] whereas natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004.[16] Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals in the case of natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.[17][15][16] In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, became the first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine.[18][19][7] Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose.[20][7] 
 Another oral drug, cladribine, was approved in Russia and Australia in 2010. Its application was rejected by the FDA and EMEA in 2011 due to safety concerns in spite of the promising efficacy of the drug. This led the pharmaceutical to discontinue commercialization and withdraw all marketing applications.[21] 
 Most of these drugs are approved only for Relapsing-Remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). 
 [edit] Side effects 
 Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause irritation at the injection site. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. 
 Interferons, a subclass of cytokines, are produced in the body during illnesses such as influenza in order to help fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches.[22] Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines.[5][23] This reaction tends to dissapear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain.[23] Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease.[23] Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days.[23] A sypmtom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity.[23] Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function.[5] In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment.[23] Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.[23] 
 Glatiramer acetate is generally considered to be better tolerated than the interferons, although some patients taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes.[24] 
 Mitoxantrone therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.[25] Heart problems (mainly systolic dysfunction) appear in over 10% of patients, while leukemia prevalence is 0.8%.[15] 
 Soon after its approval natalizumab was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).[16] PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain.[16] All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program.[16] As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all in patients who had taken natalizumab for more than a year.[16] While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold.[16] The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. [16] Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.[16] 
 [edit] Clinically isolated syndrome 
 The earliest clinical presentation of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.[26] Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases the risk of developing clinical definite MS.[5][27] 
 [edit] Relapsing-remitting MS 
 Medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[5] Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments.[5] Nevertheles, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon.[28] They can be classified in genetic, pharmacological and pathogenetic non-responders.[28] One of the factors related to non-respondance is the presence of high levels of interferon beta neutralizing antibodies. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of neutralizing antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients.[5][29] Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called "rapidly worsening MS" are normally non-responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either mitoxantrone or natalizumab.[30][31] 
 Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are considered highly effective both in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halfs the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%.[16] Moreover, mitoxantrone may be the most effective of all medications, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.[5][32] 
 There are no official guidelines yet on the use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development.[18] While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend.[18] It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived unefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate.[18] They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML.[18] 
 While more studies of the long-term effects of the drugs are needed,[5][32][33] specially for the newest treatments,[34][16] existing data on the effects of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate that early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and it is related to better outcomes.[33] 
 Even with appropriate use of medication, to varying degrees most patients with relapsing-remitting MS still suffer from some attacks and many suffer subsequent disability. 
 [edit] Secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS 
 Treatment of advanced forms of MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair. 
 Mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in patients with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in patients in short-term follow-up.[35] In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent cardiac toxicity which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. 
 Natalizumab or Tysabri has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. 
 Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses.[36] 
 [edit] Primary progressive MS 
 Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. 
 Several trials have been designed specifically for PPMS, including trials with interferon beta[37] and mitoxantrone, a phase III trial of glatiramer acetate, and an open-label study of riluzole.[38] Patients with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine,[39]methotrexate,[40]cladribine,[41]intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide,[42] and studies of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, no treatment in these trials has been shown to modify the course of the disease.[43] 
 [44] 
 [edit] Managing the effects of MS 
 Disease-modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and handicap. Management of these deficits is therefore very important. 
 Both drug therapy and neurorehabilitation have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influence disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.[45] 
 [edit] Neurorehabilitation 
 Although there are relatively few studies of rehabilitation in MS,[46][47] its general effectiveness, when conducted by a team of specialists, has been clearly demonstrated in other pathologies such as stroke[48] or head trauma.[49] As for any patient with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to limiting and overcoming disability; however there are particular difficulties in specifying a 'core team' because people with MS may need help from almost any health profession or service at some point.[50]Neurologists are mainly involved in the diagnosis and ongoing management of multiple sclerosis, and any exacerbations. The comprehensive rehabilitation process for patients with multiple sclerosis is generally managed by physiatrists. Allied treatments such as physiotherapy,[51][52]speech and language therapy[53] or occupational therapy[54] can also help to manage some symptoms and maintain quality of life. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression should involve mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists,[55] while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits.[56] Multidisciplinary approaches have been shown to be effective in increasing activity levels and participation in multiple sclerosis.[57][58] Due to the paucity of randomized controlled studies, there is limited evidence of the overall efficacy of individual therapy disciplines,[59][59][60] though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise,[61][62] psychology therapies, particularly cognitive behavioral approaches[63] and energy conservation instruction[64] are effective. More specifically psychological interventions seem useful in the treatment of depression, while evidence on effectiveness for other uses such as the treatment of cognitive impairments or vocational counseling is less strong.[65][66] It is difficult to be specific about what types of rehabilitation will be most beneficial because therapies are tailored to meet the individual's specific needs [67] 
 In regards to well-being, physical therapy focused on gait training can be vital to maximizing MS patient participation via reduction of fatigue during walking and activities of daily living (ADLs).[68] Most gait training is performed over-ground (i.e., in a gym room or outside on uneven ground), on treadmills or, less commonly, using robotic-assisted devices. Robotic-assisted body weight-supported treadmill training may be an effective therapeutic option in MS patients with severe walking impairments.[69] In contrast, over-ground gait training may be most effective in improving gait speed in MS patients with less severe impairments.[69] Equine-assisted therapies such as therapeutic horseback riding and hippotherapy are additional treatments that can positively influence gait,[70] balance and quality of life in people with MS.[71] 
 Historically, individuals with MS were advised against participation in physical activity due to worsening symptoms.[72] However, under the direction of an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS.[73] Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power,[74] mobility,[74] mood,[75] bowel health,[76] general conditioning and quality of life.[74] Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training,[77] walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others.[76] Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.[73] 
 An elevated core temperature, leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS during the course of exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure.[78] The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner. 
 [edit] Medical treatments for symptoms 
 Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). The most common clinical measure of disability progression and severity of the symptoms is the Expanded Disability Status Scale or EDSS.[79] At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on the patient and the physician. 
 Bowel: people with MS may suffer bowel problems in two ways: reduced gut mobility may follow from immobility and from the drugs used to treat various impairments; and neurological control of defecation may be directly impaired.[50] Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas.[87]
 Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric symptomatology is common in the course of the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,[88] and can be treated with a variety of antidepressants;[89]selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most frequently employed.[90] Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. This dyad was called "euphoria sclerotica" by the first authors that described the disease during the 19th century, and affects 10% of patients.[91][92]Anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil[93]—commonly used in Alzheimer disease—although not approved yet for multiple sclerosis, have shown efficacy in improving cognitive functions.[94][95]Memantine, which is also used in Alzheimer's disease, has been reported to induce reversible neurological impairment that led to stop an ongoing clinical trial.[96] Psychological interventions are also useful in the treatment of cognitive and emotional deficits.[97][98][99][100]
 Dysphagia and dysarthria: dysphagia is a difficulty with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor control over the subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A speech and language therapist may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches.[50][53] In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.[101]
 Fatigue: fatigue is very common and disabling in MS, and at the same time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology.[103] When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used.[104] In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them.[50] A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine[105][106] or pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy),[107][108] as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation,[109][110] but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.[105]
 Pain: acute pain is mainly due to optic neuritis (with corticosteroids being the best treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias.[111]Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine[112] or phenytoin.[113][114][115] Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam,[116] or amitriptyline.[117][118]Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA.[119] This medication is also being investigated for the management of other MS symptoms, such as spasticity,[120] and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.[121]
 Vision: different drugs as well as optic compensatory systems and prisms can be used to improve the symptoms of nystagmus or diplopia (double vision).[131][132][133] Surgery can also be used in some cases.[134]
 Walking : dalfampridine (ampyra) is a broad-spectrum potassium channel blocker. It is approved by the FDA to treat walking difficulties in MS. It has been shown to increase walking speed, although its high cost (over 1000 dollars a month) limits its usage. [135]
  Unfortunately, other symptoms, such as ataxia, tremor or sensory losses, do not have proven treatments.[50] 
 [edit] Therapies under investigation 
 Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. There are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Some of these treatments involve the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis, such as the joint administration of mitoxantrone and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone).[136] 
 However most treatments already in clinical trials involve drugs that are used in other diseases. These are the cases of alemtuzumab (Campath),[137]daclizumab (Zenapax),[138]inosine,[139] or BG00012.[140] Alemtuzumab performed better than interferon beta-1a in relapsing-remitting MS reducing disability, imaging abnormalities and frequence of relapses, at the cost of increased autoimmunity problems. These included three cases of thrombocytopenic purpura which led to the suspension of the therapy.[141] Other drugs in clinical trials have been designed specifically for MS, such as fingolimod[142], laquinimod,[143] or Neurovax.[144] 
 In humans, BCG vaccine, the common, live, attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis, has substantially reduced recurrence of symptoms in multiple sclerosis patients.[145] The frequency of new enhancing lesions as detected by Gd-enhanced MRI was reduced by more than half in 12 patients, comparing the six-month run-in phase to the six-month post BCG phase of the experiment. Persistence at subsequent MR scan was reduced from 18 to 1 lesion, and evolution to black holes was reduced from 28 to 6 lesions.[146] The conventional explanation of such protection is that parasites (including bacteria) modulate the sensitivity of the immune system. BCG appears safe as a treatment for multiple sclerosis.[145][147] 
 Many anecdotes are found on the Internet about the effectiveness of low dose naltrexone for MS, but no published scientific studies or case reports address its effectiveness.[148] Statins administered in combination with interferons have not shown an improved efficacy over interferons only.[149] Finally, there are also many early-stage investigations that in the future may emerge as new treatments. Examples of these are the studies trying to understand the influence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae or vitamin D in the origin of the disease,[150][151] or preliminary investigations on the use of helminthic therapy,[152] or angioplasty and venous stents based on the theory that an incorrect blood drainage system weakens the blood–brain barrier.[153]Parenchymal stem cells have a great potential as a therapy since they could theoretically help to modulate the immune system to stop axonal damage and even repair the central nervous system. Nevertheless such therapies are still at the initial stages of research. [154] 
 An MS treatment has been developed containing an extract of sea anemone venom. The treatment inhibits T-cells - the white blood cells responsible for nerve damage in MS patients. Ten years into its development, the drug is on the cusp of undergoing clinical trials.[155] 
 [edit] Alternative treatments 
 A recent study found that over 60% of MS patients use complementary and alternative medicine, possibly because conventional treatments lack effectiveness. Except for vitamin D, evidence is lacking for these treatments and there are no clear guidelines for their use.[156] 
 The effect of diet on MS is unclear, with studies unable to show whether diet contributes to MS or can alter its course. Ecologic studies have found a link between high consumptions of polyunsaturated fats and low MS prevalence. The most promising evidence comes from daily supplementation with vitamin D. Evidence is lacking for several other widely promoted non-herbal supplements, including vitamin B12, alpha-lipoic acid, luteolin, and evening primrose oil.[156] Many diets have been proposed for treating the symptoms of the disease. Patients have reported a decrease in symptoms after long-term application of changes in diet; however, no controlled trials have been able to prove their efficacy.[157] Even if these diets are genuinely beneficial for people with MS, it is not known whether this is due to any special traits for MS, as opposed to their known benefits for whole body health.[156] Two examples of such diets are the low saturated fat Swank Multiple Sclerosis Diet.[158][159] 
 Herbal medicine is another source of alternative treatments. Many patients use medical marijuana to help alleviate symptoms; however, the results of experimental studies are scarce and further clinical trials are required.[160][161] Derivatives from the herb common rue (Ruta graveolens); which contain compounds that block Kv1.3 channels in T cells; have also been suggested to ameliorate MS symptoms.[162][163] Kv1.3 channel-blockers are in development for the treatment of the disease.[164][165] 
 Bee venom therapy has been promoted as a possible treatment for MS, as it is thought to be an anti-inflammatory and inflammation is a component of MS. Research results have been variable and its benefit has not been demonstrated. Its greatest safety issue is the risk of anaphylactic shock, as about 15% of the population is allergic to bee stings.[156] 
 Hyperbaric oxygenation has been the subject of several small studies with heterogeneous results which, overall, do not support its use.[166] 
 Relaxation disciplines such as yoga, and general exercise, seem to mitigate fatigue and improve quality of life.[167] Some studies also show benefits on physical variables, such as balance and strength or cardiovascular and respiratory function, but more investigation is needed as the studies are usually of low quality.[168]
