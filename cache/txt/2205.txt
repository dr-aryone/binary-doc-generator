  
 Supernature is the third studio album by English electronic music duo Goldfrapp. It was released on 17 August 2005 by Mute Records, and received mostly favourable reviews. Most critics complimented its blend of pop and electronic music, while others called it uninspiring.[5]Supernature was a top five album in Goldfrapp's native United Kingdom, and its lead single "Ooh La La" was a top five single.[6] In North America, where "Number 1" was promoted as the first single, the album was released on 7 March 2006, but did not perform well on the charts.[7] 
 The album represented a change in Goldfrapp's musical style and featured pop and electronic dance music; inspirations were American disco artist Donna Summer and English New Wave band New Order. Supernature received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album.[8] In January 2006, the album was certified platinum in the UK, and has sold one million copies worldwide as of early 2007.[9][10] 
 [edit] Recording and production 
 Supernature contains music in the same pop and electronic dance styles featured on Goldfrapp's 2003 album Black Cherry (especially Black Cherry's singles "Strict Machine" and "Twist"), but it focuses on subtle hooks instead of large choruses. Goldfrapp's lead singer Alison Goldfrapp called the album's writing process "an electronic, glam cross between Berlin, New York and north-east Somerset",[11] and said that she was inspired by artists such as Donna Summer and New Order.[11] 
 Goldfrapp and Will Gregory recorded the bulk of Supernature in late 2004 in the countryside of Bath, England—the same place they recorded Black Cherry. They had rented a small house and spent some months writing music; they later explained that the unpopulated location kept them from distractions and that the majority of the process was "very basic".[12] Goldfrapp has said that the duo respect certain boundaries when writing lyrics,[13] referring to their studio sessions as a "democratic affair".[13] The lyrical content of the song "Number 1", which became the album's second single, is about the importance and meaning of relationships, even though they do not necessarily last.[12] 
 In an interview with College Music Journal, Goldfrapp explained that they had never intended to create dance music.[13] However, the singles released from Black Cherry were successes across nightclubs in North America, and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album.[7] Although this made the duo nervous, "Ooh La La" was the group's first song to feature the electric guitar.[14] Before its composition, the duo avoided the use of the guitar because of the guitar's overly recognisable rhythm.[13]Four-on-the-floor bass drums are also present on several of the album's tracks, and the piano ballad "Let It Take You" features evening-effects composed on a synthesiser.[15] "You Never Know" begins with Alison Goldfrapp executing a synthesised voice, supported by both pads and synthesisers.[15] Goldfrapp and Gregory have cited "Satin Chic" as their favourite song on Supernature.[15] 
 Alison Goldfrapp named the Roland String synth as one of her favourite keyboards.[14] "Number 1" features an old synth and a bass arrangement that the group began to use frequently after recording the song. Another Roland String model, the SH-09, is another favourite; she played the duo's song "Train" (2003) on it and enjoys the sounds that it makes.[14] Goldfrapp was also impressed by a Russian synth, enamored with its Russian-language writing.[14] 
 [edit] Composition 
 "Ooh La La", Supernature's opening track, inspired by T. Rex,[16] was chosen as its lead single "because it was up and in your face and it carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album".[17] It was the duo's first song to feature the electric guitar, and received positive reviews, often being noted as a highlight of the album.[4][18] In the United Kingdom, "Ooh La La" became Goldfrapp's most successful single release to date, reaching number four.[6] It was also promoted in US dance clubs, eventually topping the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.[7] The second track, "Lovely 2 C U", received mixed reviews from critics, with one reviewer stating that it was the "worst offender of sounding by-numbers, its lazy glam affectations sounding all the worse amid a chorus striking only in its complete dullness".[1][19] 
 "Ride a White Horse", the third single, was inspired by the disco era.[16] Like previous singles from the album, the song was another top twenty single in the UK.[6] The ballads "You Never Know" and "Let It Take You" have minimal background electronics, and were generally well received by critics, who drew comparisons to Goldfrapp's debut album Felt Mountain.[20][21] "Fly Me Away", another synth ballad, had an associated music video which featured Goldfrapp as an animated doll; the video, however, was never released.[22] The song was not heavily promoted and was less commercially successful than the other singles. "Slide In", an electroclash song about sex, and "Koko" were compared to Gary Numan's early compositions.[3][23] A remix of "Slide In" by DFA was released as a promotional 12-inch single in the UK in November 2005.[24] 
 "Satin Chic" is a disco song with glam rock and cabaret influences, similar to early Elton John.[21] Cited by Goldfrapp and Gregory as their favourite song on Supernature, it was remixed by The Flaming Lips, and issued as a limited edition single in September 2006.[15] The tenth track, "Time Out from the World", features an orchestra and whispered vocals by Goldfrapp. Critics liked the song, writing that it was an "exception to the prevailing style of Supernature" due to its "haunting, yet glamorous, atmospherics".[3][25] The album's closing track and second single "Number 1" is about the importance and meanings of relationships.[12] The song, which is based around a synth and bass arrangement, reached number nine in the UK and number one on the US dance chart.[7] 
 [edit] Release and artwork 
 The album was released in two versions: a single disc version, which used Opendisc technology to offer extras via a website, and a double disc version which included the album in surround sound on both discs. The first disc is a hybrid SACD with 5.1 multichannel SACD audio, stereo SACD audio and stereo CD audio. The second disc, a DVD-Video, contains the multichannel version of the album in DTS 96/24 as well as a documentary and music videos for "Ooh La La" and "Number 1". 
 The album cover, photographed by Ross Kirton, is a rear-view shot of Alison against a black curtain, looking over her shoulder while covering her breast with her hand. The regular edition cover shows her from the waist up, whereas the US special edition shows the cover art in its entirety, with Alison wearing a long plume of peacock feathers and golden platform shoes.[26] In late 2005, the album ranked number eight on the annual Best Art Vinyl poll.[27] 
 [edit] Critical reception 
 Supernature received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 27 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".[5] In a review for PopMatters, Adrien Begrand said that "[a]lthough Supernature lacks the imagination of Felt Mountain and the saucy brilliance of Black Cherry, it doesn't pander to the pop crowd."[21] Lauren Gitlin of Rolling Stone said the album was "[t]oxic and delicious" and that "Supernature will make you do bad things—and like it."[30] However, Pitchfork Media reviewer Nitsuh Abebe was less impressed, and wrote that the album's songs "keep feeling like exercises: too thick and melodic to work like dance music, but with melodies that refuse to stick as satisfyingly as pop."[29] Michael Hubbard of musicOMH wrote a review for every song on Supernature, and although he felt that it was a "curious, rather than classic, record", he criticised it for "fading out early on, with poor, low quality songs at the end which leave the listener feeling cheated".[25]Allmusic critic Heather Phares called Supernature "Goldfrapp's most accessible album" and named "Ooh La La" as its best song.[4] 
 In a review for Canadian-based website Jam!, Andrew Carver praised the different sounds on Supernature, which range from "a blend of future noise" to "crushed velvet corruption"; he described the album as "one sharp recording".[33] Jessica Suarez of Spin magazine compared "Ooh La La" to Black Cherry's "Strict Machine", saying that "Ooh La La" sounds "so simplistic that [its] minimalist repetition occasionally teeters over into redundancy". She praised "Ride a White Horse" and "Fly Me Away" for featuring Alison Goldfrapp's "velvet-soft vocals, which stay that way even when heavily processed".[34] A less favourable reception came from Stylus Magazine reviewer Edward Oculicz, who stated "Supernature is not a great album" and called several of its tracks too "dull".[1] 
 Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album at number thirty-two on its list of The Top 50 Albums of 2006.[35] In January 2008, the album was included on The Daily Telegraph's list of the 120 essential pop albums.[36] At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Goldfrapp received two nominations for Best Electronic/Dance Album and Best Dance Recording for "Ooh La La".[8] 
 [edit] Chart performance 
 Supernature debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number two (blocked from the top position by James Blunt's Back to Bedlam), and sold 52,976 copies in its first week of release.[11] The album remained on the chart for thirty-one weeks, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry on 13 January 2006.[9][37] By 20 December 2010, the album had sold 500,000 copies in the UK.[38] In Australia, it peaked at number twenty-three, despite limited promotion.[39] The album reached the top ten in Ireland,[40] the top twenty in Belgium,[41] the top thirty in Germany[42] and Switzerland,[43] and the top forty in Austria,[44] Italy,[45] the Netherlands,[46] New Zealand[47] and Norway.[48] It has sold one million copies worldwide as of 2006.[10]Supernature became Goldfrapp's first release to chart on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, where it peaked at number one-hundred thirty-eight.[49] It reached number three on the Top Heatseekers chart and number five on the Top Electronic Albums chart.[49] The album has sold 49,000 copies in the US as of August 2006.[50]Supernature was also Goldfrapp's first release in Canada, where it peaked at number eighty-eight on the Canadian Albums Chart.[51][52]
