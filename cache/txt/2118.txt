  
 Homework is the debut studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released in January 1997 on Virgin Records. Homework's success brought worldwide attention to French progressive house music and sparked interest in French touch music. According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. The duo produced the tracks without plans to release an album. After working on projects that were intended to be separate singles over five months, they considered the material good for an album. 
 Commercially successful, Homework appeared in 14 national charts, peaking at number 150 on the United States Billboard 200 and at number 37 on the Australian Albums Chart. By February 2001, the album had sold more than two million copies worldwide and received several gold and platinum certifications. Homework received positive critical response and became known as the foundation of the French touch movement. The album features singles that had significant impact in the French house and global dance music scenes. These include the US Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play number-one singles "Da Funk" and "Around the World", the latter of which reached number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100. 
 [edit] Recording history 
 In 1993 Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo presented a demo of their electronic music to DJ Stuart Macmillan at a rave at EuroDisney.[1] The contents of the cassette were released on the single "The New Wave" on April 11, 1994, by Soma Quality Recordings, a Scottish techno and house label co-founded in 1991 by MacMillan's band Slam.[2] Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "Da Funk",[3] which was released later that year alongside "Rollin' &amp; Scratchin'" under the Soma label.[4] 
 
 
 
 We've got much more control than money. You can't get everything. We live in a society where money is what people want, so they can't get the control. We chose. Control is freedom. People say we're control freaks, but control is controlling your destiny without controlling other people. 
 —Thomas Bangalter, in regards to the duo's creative control and freedom[5]

 The increasing popularity of Daft Punk's singles led to a bidding war among record labels, resulting in the duo's signing to Virgin Records in 1996.[6][7] Their departure was noted by Richard Brown of Soma, who affirmed that "we were obviously sad to lose them to Virgin but they had the chance to go big, which they wanted, and it's not very often that a band has that chance after two singles. We're happy for them."[1] Virgin re-released "Da Funk" with the B-side "Musique" in 1996, a year before releasing Homework. Bangalter later stated that the B-side "was never intended to be on the album, and in fact, 'Da Funk' as a single has sold more units than Homework, so more people own it anyways [sic] than they would if it had been on the album. It is basically used to make the single a double-feature."[8] The album was mixed and recorded in Daft Punk's studio, Daft House in Paris. It was mastered by Nilesh Patel at the London studio The Exchange.[9] 
 Bangalter stated that "to be free, we had to be in control. To be in control, we had to finance what we were doing ourselves. The main idea was to be free."[10] Daft Punk discussed their method with Spike Jonze, director of the "Da Funk" music video. He noted that "they were doing everything based on how they wanted to do it. As opposed to, 'oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.' They wanted to make sure they never had to do anything that would make them feel bummed on making music."[11] Although Virgin Records holds exclusive distribution rights over Daft Punk’s material, the duo still owns their master recordings through their Daft Trax label.[6][12] 
 [edit] Structure 
 Daft Punk produced the tracks included in Homework without a plan to release an album. Bangalter stated, "It was supposed to be just a load of singles. But we did so many tracks over a period of five months that we realized that we had a good album."[13] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP.[8] De Homem-Christo remarked, "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album."[8] The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to "the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff."[14] 
 "Daftendirekt" is an excerpt of a live performance recorded at the first I Love Techno party in Ghent, Belgium.[9] It served as the introduction to Daft Punk's live shows and was used to begin the album.[8]Janet Jackson sampled "Daftendirekt" on her song "So Much Betta", which was included in her tenth studio album, Discipline, in 2008.[17]Homework's following track, "WDPK 83.7 FM", is a tribute to FM radio in the US.[10] The next song, "Revolution 909" is a reflection on the French government's stance on dance music.[8][18] 
 "Revolution 909" is followed by "Da Funk", which carries elements of funk and acid music.[1] According to Andrew Asch of the Boca Raton News, the song's composition "relies on a bouncy funk guitar to communicate its message of dumb fun."[19] Bangalter expressed that "Da Funk"'s theme involved the introduction of a simple, unusual element that becomes acceptable and moving over time.[20]Robert Christgau considered "Da Funk" the only good track on the album and selected it as his choice cut,[21] while Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt that the song was "unrelenting".[22] Bob Gajarsky of Westnet called it "a beautiful meeting of Chic (circa "Good Times", sans vocals) and the 90s form of electronica."[23] The song appeared on the soundtrack for the 1997 film The Saint and was placed at number 18 on Pitchfork Media's "Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s" list.[24] "Phoenix" combines elements of gospel music and house music.[8] The duo considered "Fresh" to be breezy and light with a comical structure.[25] Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine criticized the song, stating that it "doesn’t feel like the beach just because of the lapping waves heard in the background."[26] 
 The single "Around the World" carries influences of Gershon Kingsley's hit "Popcorn".[1] Its music video was directed by the Academy Award-winning French filmmaker Michel Gondry, who compared the track's bassline to that of "Good Times" by Chic.[27] Chris Power of BBC Music named it "one of the decade’s catchiest singles". He stated that it was "a perfect example of Daft Punk’s sound at its most accessible: a post-disco boogie bassline, a minimalist sprinkling of synthetic keyboard melody and a single, naggingly insistent hook."[16] Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine commented that "there is no way you’d want to have a Homework without 'Around The World'."[26] The track "Teachers" is a tribute to several of Daft Punk's house music influences, including future collaborators Romanthony, DJ Sneak and Todd Edwards.[28] The song "Oh Yeah" features DJ Deelat and DJ Crabbe. "Indo Silver Club" features a sample of "Hot Shot" by Karen Young.[9] Prior to its inclusion on Homework, "Indo Silver Club" was released as a single on the Soma Quality Recordings label in two parts.[29] The single lacked an artist credit in the packaging[29] and was thought to have been created by the nonexistent producers Indo Silver Club.[30] The final track, "Funk Ad", is a reversed clip of "Da Funk".[8] 
 [edit] Singles 
 Homework features singles that had significant impact in the French house[31] and global dance music scenes.[6] The first single from the album, "Alive", was included as a B-side on the single "The New Wave", which was released in April 1994. The album's second single was "Da Funk"; it was initially released in 1995 by Soma and was re-released by Virgin Records in 1996. It became the duo's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart.[32] The song reached number seven on British[33] and French charts.[34] The third single, "Around the World", was a critical and commercial success, becoming the second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart,[32] as well as reaching number 11 in Australia,[35] number five in the United Kingdom[36] and number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100.[37] In October 2011, NME placed "Around the World" at number 21 on its list of "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".[38] The album's fourth single was "Burnin'"; it was released in September 1997 and peaked at number 30 in the UK.[36] The final single from Homework was "Revolution 909". It was released in February 1998 and reached number 47 in the UK[36] and number 12 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart.[37] 
 In 1999, the duo released a video collection featuring music videos of tracks and singles from the album. It was named D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes, although a cohesive plot does not connect its episodes. Its title derives from the appearances of dogs ("Da Funk" and "Fresh"), androids ("Around the World"), firemen ("Burnin'"), and tomatoes ("Revolution 909") in the videos.[39] 
 [edit] Reception 
 [edit] Commercial performance 
 Daft Punk wanted the majority of pressings to be in vinyl, so only 50,000 albums were initially printed in CD format. After its release, overwhelming sales of Homework caused distributors to accelerate production to satisfy demand. The album was distributed in 35 countries worldwide,[6] peaking at number 150 on the Billboard 200.[40]Homework first charted on the Australian Albums Chart on April 27, 1997; it remained there for eight weeks and peaked at number 37.[41] In France, the album reached number three and stayed on the chart for 82 weeks. On February 1, 1997, after selling more than 100,000 copies in the UK, Homework was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry.[42] In 1999, it reached Gold status in France for selling more than 100,000 copies.[43] On July 11, 2001, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, indicating sales of 500,000 copies in the US.[44][45] By October 1997, the album has sold 220,000 copies worldwide,[46] although Billboard reported that, according to Virgin Records, two million copies have been sold by February 2001.[47] By September 2007, 605,000 copies have been sold in the United States.[48] 
 [edit] Critical response 
 Homework's success brought worldwide attention to French progressive house music,[54] and drew attention to French touch music.[31] According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula.[55] In the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, critic Alex Rayner stated that Homework tied the established club styles to the "burgeoning eclecticism" of big beat. He contended that it served as a proof that "there was more to dance music than pills and keyboard presets."[56] An Agence France-Presse report identified the album as the foundation of the late 20th century French touch scene.[57] The website Clashmusic described Homework as an entry point of accessibility for a "burgeoning movement on the cusp of splitting the mainstream seam."[58] 
 In 2009, Brian Linder of IGN described Homework as the duo's third-best album. He catalogued as a "groundbreaking achievement" the way they used their unique skills to craft the house, techno, acid and punk music styles into the record.[59] Hua Hsu of eMusic agreed, applauding Homework for how it captured a "feeling of discovery and exploration" as a result of "years of careful study of the finest house, techno, electro and hip-hop records."[52] David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, stated that the duo knew how to use "their playful, hip-hopping ambient techno" to craft the album. He named Homework the "ideal disco for androids".[50] Sean Cooper of Allmusic called the album "an almost certain classic" and "essential".[49] 
 Chris Power of BBC Music compared Homework's "less-is-more" approach to compression's use as "a sonic tribute" to the FM radio stations that "fed Daft Punk’s youthful obsessions."[16] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that "while a few tracks are more daft than deft," more recent groundbreakers like The Avalanches could never exist without "Da Funk".[22] Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that "there’s a core of unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you’ve got such a classic debut hidden in the outlines of the epic slouch of their debut, it’s hard not to get frustrated."[26]Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that it was stupid but that it was not stupid enough."[53]Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" while affirming that Daft Punk's debut "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance."[53] 
 According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, "Daft Punk [tore] the lid off the [creative] sewer" with the release of Homework.[55] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media awarded it 7.6 out of 10. He stated that "Homework provides sixteen whole tracks of modern-day boom box bass n' drum and unlike your science project, it doesn't require a lot of intricate calculations to figure out how it works." In his view, "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree."[51] Conversely, music critic Robert Christgau considered "Da Funk" to be the only good track on an album "that isn't worth your time or money".[21][60] Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best."[61]
