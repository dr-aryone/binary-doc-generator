  
 Tropical Storm Cindy was a weak but unusually wet North Atlantic hurricane that caused disastrous flooding across Martinique in August 1993. Cindy formed east of the island and became the annual hurricane season's third named storm on August 14. Due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions, Cindy remained disorganized while crossing the northeastern Caribbean Sea. After attaining maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), the storm began to weaken from interaction with the high terrain of Hispaniola. It made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a tropical depression on August 16, and dissipated over the territory the following day. 
 Despite its poor structure, Cindy dropped torrential rain over portions of the northeastern Caribbean. The island of Martinique received up to 15.6 inches (395 mm) of rain in two hours, affecting northern villages and communes. Le Prêcheur was devastated by extensive flooding, which washed away entire structures and wrought $2.7 million (1993 USD) in damage. The disaster left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain. Heavy downpours and flooding killed two people in the Dominican Republic, though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown. 
 [edit] Meteorological history 
 The origins of Tropical Storm Cindy can be traced to a tropical wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August 8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on August 13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, although a second mission at 1200 UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depression—a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39 mph (62 km/h)—and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.[1][2] 
 Steered by mid- to low-level flow, the depression decreased in forward speed and continued to the west-northwest toward Martinique. Satellite images showed the development of a central dense overcast, and reconnaissance soon revealed that its winds had increased to gale force. Based on this, the NHC upgraded the cyclone to Tropical Storm Cindy at 1800 UTC on August 14, when the circulation center was over Martinique with winds of 40 mph (65 km). Although Cindy briefly developed favorable outflow, its upper-level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles, preventing further development.[1] Over the course of August 15, Cindy's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable wind shear; its center became ill defined, with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone.[3][4] Despite the unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August 16, attaining its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1007 mbar (hPa; 29.74 inHg), roughly 85 mi (140 km) southeast of Santo Domingo.[1] 
 Shortly after peaking in intensity, Cindy began to interact with the mountains of Hispaniola. The high terrain disrupted its circulation, which caused it to weaken to a tropical depression around 2100 UTC on August 16. The depression made landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h); it became increasingly disorganized over land, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August 17. The remnants proceeded inland near the border with Haiti and emerged into the Atlantic, where they spread across the Bahamas before dissolving on the next day.[1][5] 
 [edit] Preparations 
 When Cindy became a tropical cyclone on August 14, tropical storm warnings were issued for the Lesser Antilles from Martinique northward to the Virgin Islands; a tropical storm watch was posted for Puerto Rico.[6][7] The warnings, excluding those for the Virgin Islands, were discontinued on August 15, after Cindy moved away from the island chain; however, the watch for Puerto Rico was simultaneously upgraded to a warning.[8] Officials in Puerto Rico also issued flash flood warnings for the island, and about 600 people living in flood-prone areas sought shelter ahead of the storm. Ferry service between Fajardo and the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques was suspended as a precaution, leaving about 400 passengers stranded for a day.[9] A price freeze was placed on emergency supplies, including wood, nails, batteries, kerosene, and lanterns.[10][11] 
 On August 15, a tropical storm warning was issued in the Dominican Republic, from Samaná to Cabo Engaño along the northern coast and westward to Isla Beata off the southwestern coast.[8] Thousands of residents stocked up on bottled water, canned goods, and gas, though stores around the capital remained closed for the day.[12] The Santo Domingo International Airport suspended all flight operations in the early hours of August 16.[13] The tropical storm warning for the island was discontinued when Cindy made landfall as no more than a tropical depression.[8] In Cuba, a storm warning was issued for eastern provinces as forecasters warned of heavy rainfall.[14] 
 [edit] Impact 
 [edit] Lesser Antilles 
 On August 14, Cindy passed over Martinique with rough winds and particularly violent rainfall. In a span of two hours, 15.55 inches (395 mm) of rain were recorded at Saint-Joseph, of which 2.75 in (70 mm) fell in only six minutes.[17]Le Prêcheur received 5.79 in (147 mm) within one hour, though the 24-hour total reached 12.0 in (305 mm).[24][25] These amounts were well above the September average of 9.29 in (236 mm), making Cindy one of the most extreme rain events in the island's history.[17] 
 Initially, Cindy produced brisk winds across northern Martinique, downing banana trees and power lines.[26] Following hours of extreme rainfall, several rivers—such as the Rivière des Pères, Rivière Claire and Rivière Sèche—quickly swelled and overflowed.[27] Catastrophic flooding and mudslides submerged northern villages, damaging homes, roads, and other structures, including a vital bridge in Anse Belleville.[26][28][29] News footage was shown on national television of "cars [being] swept away to sea and buried in mud".[10] The Prêcheur River—which normally flows at 18 ft3/s (0.5 m3/s)—attained an exceptional discharge rate of nearly 25,000 ft3/s (700 m3/s) before bursting its banks, causing destructive flooding in the small commune of Le Prêcheur.[30] The flood waters, mixed with traces of volcanic sediment, reached localized heights of up to 10 ft (3 m) and wrought an estimated ₣15 million ($2.7 million) in damage to homes and roads.[31] A similar flood struck the village of Grand'Rivière when the nearby Grande Rivière overflowed, resulting in one drowning victim.[26][32] Despite recent restoration of its flood defenses, the Rivière Roxelane rapidly crested and inundated the adjacent commune of Saint-Pierre.[33] Further south, a combination of heavy rainfall and poor storm drains resulted in widespread flood damage to private property and an aquafarm in Le Morne-Vert.[34] 
 In all, the storm killed 2 people, injured 11, and destroyed more than 150 homes across Martinique.[10][29] After its passage, thousands of people on the island sought refuge in emergency shelters, and about 3,000 residents became homeless.[10][26]La Capricieuse, a French Navy ship stationed in French Guiana, delivered disaster relief supplies to Fort-de-France; the goods included 250 packages with clothing items, which had been distributed by the Lions Club Association of Saint Barthélémy.[35] Unseasonable sea conditions in Cindy's wake temporarily hindered local fishers from selling their fish to trading vessels in Petite Martinique.[36] Following the severe extent of flooding, dredgings were carried out across Martinique, while river banks and dykes were reinforced to prevent recurrence.[37] 
 Minimal effects were felt elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles. In Guadeloupe, the storm dropped up to 4 in (100 mm) of rain; an official total of 3.03 in (77 mm) was recorded at Raizet Airport.[38] The airport additionally measured a wind gust of 38 mph (61 km/h), just below tropical storm force.[39] Moderate breeze with embedded gusts to 28 mph (44 km/h) brushed Dominica, and 1.25 in (32 mm) of rain fell at Canefield Airport within 24 hours of Cindy's passage.[40] Further south, a weather station in Saint Lucia recorded 1.88 in (48 mm) of precipitation, as well as light winds.[41] As Cindy passed to the south of the Virgin Islands, unsettled seas and minor beach erosion affected the islands' south shores, with swells of 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) reported at Saint Croix.[11] Onshore, the island experienced wind gusts to 35 mph (55 km/h) and 1.48 in (38 mm) of rainfall.[25][42] 
 [edit] Greater Antilles 
 On August 16, Cindy made its closest point of approach to Puerto Rico, although its center remained well south of the island.[5] Impact from the storm was limited to intermittent downpours and 8 ft (2.4 m) waves along the southern coast.[43] The high waves and rough sea caused some minor erosion to beach facilities.[11] According to a report from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a maximum of 5.54 in (141 mm) of rain fell near Río Cerrillos in Ponce; however, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) reported a peak total of 4.60 in (117 mm) at Puerto Real in Cabo Rojo.[11][42] Many other locations received rainfall amounts of 2.0–4.5 in (50–115 mm), flooding some roads and low-lying areas.[11] 
 Cindy produced considerable rainfall in southern and eastern parts of the Dominican Republic, with totals of 4–10 in (100–255 mm).[13][25] Upon the storm's landfall in the country, winds reached 35 mph (55 km/h) in Barahona.[5] The rainfall caused scattered street flooding and filled rivers, affecting hundreds of residents.[12][13] In Villa Altagracia, one fatality was reported when a child drowned in flood waters; the final death toll for the country stood at two.[13][25]
