  
 Central Coast Mariners Football Club is a professional association football club based on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. They participate in the A-League and are one of four teams from the state of New South Wales playing in the competition. The Mariners were the first professional football (soccer) club from the Central Coast to compete in a national competition,[1][2] and were formed during 2004 for the foundation of the A-League in 2005–06. Despite being considered one of the smaller franchises at the inception of the A-League competition,[2][3] Central Coast qualified for the first four domestic finals after their establishment.[4] The Mariners had a successful first season, winning the 2005 Pre-Season Cup and losing in the A-League grand final to Sydney FC.[5] 
 Central Coast made the final of the Pre-Season Cup again in 2006, however lost to Adelaide United. The Mariners came sixth in the 2006–07 A-League competition, and failed to qualify for the finals series.[6] The Mariners claimed their first A-League Premiers' Plate in 2007–08 by goal difference, holding on after starting the season strongly. The Mariners defeated derby rivals Newcastle Jets in the major semi-final to qualify for the Grand Final, which they lost to the Jets 1–0.[7] In the 2008/2009 season The Mariners finished the home and away season in fourth place before slumping to 2 defeats from the Queensland Roar in the minor semi-final legs 2–0 at home and 2–1 away. The club made its debut in the AFC Champions League in 2009,[8] finishing bottom of their group after amassing two points after two draws and losing the remaining four games. After a change of manager and squad transfers, the 2010–11 season was more successful for the club, with the A-league and youth league teams finishing second in their respective leagues. 
 [edit] History 
 [edit] Lawrie McKinna era 
 The Central Coast Mariners' bid for a franchise in the Football Federation Australia's (FFA) new A-League competition aimed to fill the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA.[9] Media speculation prior to announcement of the franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian national team player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened their proposal.[10] As the only regional bidder, the Mariners were expected to make it in to the league by default.[11] Following a reported signed deal with the FFA,[12] the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player as coach.[13] To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United.[14] After much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of Australian Soccer Association's domestic competition, the Hyundai A-League on 1 November 2004.[15][16] 
 At the time of the formation of the new league in 2004, the club was owned by Spirits Sports and Leisure Group.[17] The club announced early on its search for a star player under the leagues' allowance for one star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, insisting that the player should not look at the position as a retirement fund.[18] Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players Ante Milicic and Simon Colosimo, and also announced that he may sign more than the three required under-20 players.[19] Early concerns for the club centred around the concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology giants Toshiba and a cash injection from local businessman John Singleton, the clubs financial worries were eased.[20][21] McKinna was keen to sign local player Damien Brown of Bateau Bay, formerly of the Newcastle Jets.[22] In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was "over the moon", Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman Lyall Gorman was pleased that a local had become a "foundation player" and part of Brown's role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area.[23] By early December 2004, the club had created a steady foundation of player signings and began negotiations with former Perth Glory striker Nik Mrdja,[24] signing him later in the month as their star striker.[25] Mrjda was one of the most prominent players in the last season of the National Soccer League, shooting the final goal to secure Perth Glory's finals win.[26] The club management were reluctant to sign a star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, stipulating that they "would have to contribute on the pitch and get people to come to the ground."[27] 
  
The Mariners' inaugural season was considered a resounding success by many,[3][28] with the team reaching the A-League grand final after finishing third during the regular season.[29] They were defeated by Sydney FC 1–0 in the grand final, playing in front of a crowd of 41,689—a competition record at the time.[30] The Mariners also won the 2005 Pre-Season Cup, defeating Perth Glory in the final 1–0.[31] 
 The Mariners developed a strong rivalry with Newcastle Jets throughout their first season, often referred to as The F3 Derby.[32] The naming is a reference to the unofficial designation of the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway, the major motorway which joins the two clubs.[33] 
 Prior to the 2006–07 season, the Mariners secured the services of then Australian international Tony Vidmar from NAC Breda for two years.[34] This was the Mariners' first marquee signing, following the lead of Sydney FC (Dwight Yorke) and Adelaide United (Qu Shengqing).[35] The Coast again reached the grand final of the Pre-Season Cup, losing to Adelaide United 5–4 on penalties after scores were tied 1–1 after extra time.[36] Central Coast then participated in the 2006–07 A-League season, however were unable to gain a spot in the final series, finishing sixth after the regular season.[6] 
 Club captain Noel Spencer was released by the mariners then signed to participate in the Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment.[37] 
 In February 2008, the Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership between the Mariners, The Blades and other partner clubs including Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China, São Paulo of Brazil and White Star Woluwé of Belgium benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme of the club to develop by touring the world and developing their footballing background, whilst in reverse, the Mariners will be able to share in having some of Sheffield United's Youth Academy or reserve team prospects available to play. Current Western Sydney triallist Gregor Pac led the way out of the many fine Youth Academy players that it is hoped could take advantage of this overseas link. 
 The 2007–08 season saw Central Coast win their first premiership on goal difference ahead of Newcastle, following a remarkable final round which began with all four of the top teams equal on 31 points. The final series began badly for the club, losing the first leg of their major semi final 2–0 in Newcastle however they were able to come back to be 2–0 ahead in the second leg after 90 minutes, taking the match to extra time. A 95th minute goal then won the tie for Central Coast 3–2 on aggregate, putting them through to the grand final, where they again faced Newcastle. Newcastle defeated Central Coast 1–0 in the grand final, however the match ended in controversy with what replays have shown to be a hand-ball in the Central Coast penalty box, which would have given Central Coast a penalty and a chance to equalise. In a heated discussion after the penalty was not given, goalkeeper Danny Vukovic brushed away the Referee's hand, this was controversially referred to as a strike resulting in Vukovic's immediate send off and later suspension. 
 Goalkeeper Danny Vukovic was suspended from both domestic and international competition for "striking" referee Mark Shield in the A-League Grand Final in February 2008. Despite appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by FIFA in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the 2008 Olympic Games.[38] The ban involved games at all levels up till 6 October 2008. 
 Due to Central Coast losing their first choice keeper for the first couple months of the season, the Mariners signed high profile former Manchester United and Socceroos keeper, Mark Bosnich, on a seven week contract. This is the first time Bosnich had played professional football since 2003, due to drug problems. 
 The 2008–09 season was disappointing compared to the standards set in the previous season, although the club narrowly qualified for the finals, finishing in fourth, two points ahead of Sydney F.C. and Wellington Phoenix. They lost 4–1 on aggregrate in their minor semi-final against Queensland Roar, ending their season. 
 [edit] Graham Arnold era 
 In February 2010, following the conclusion of the club's disappointing 2009–10 season, McKinna chose to move into a new role, becoming the club's Football and Commercial Operations Manager. Socceroos assistant manager Graham Arnold was appointed as the club's new manager, becoming only the club's second manager.[39] 
 In the lead-up to the 2010–11 season, a number of transfers took place, resulting in a number of changes to the club's squad. In June 2010, the club announced the signing of Argentine 2005 Under 20's World Cup winner Patricio Perez, followed by Dutch defender Patrick Zwaanswijk.[40][41] 
 In July 2010, it was announced that the Mariner's W-League Women's team would not compete in the 2010–11 Westfield W-league competition. The club stated financial reasons were behind the decision, after Football NSW withdrew its funding.[42] 
 In spite of relatively low expectations in the lead up to the season, the 2010–11 season was extremely successful for the club, with the A-league and youth league teams both finishing 2nd in their respective leagues in the regular season.[43][44][45] The senior team were then defeated by the premiers, Brisbane Roar, 4–2 on aggregate over two legs in their major semi-final, before defeating Gold Coast United 1–0 in the Preliminary Final to qualify for the grand final against Brisbane.[46][47] By reaching the grand final, the club also qualified for the 2012 AFC Champions League.[48] In a thrilling grand final, the Mariners were defeated 4–2 in a penalty shootout after leading 2–0 with three minutes remaining in extra time to finish runners-up for the third time.[49] 
 The 2011–12 season was similarly successful, with the club winning the premiership for the second time in their history, with 51 points, 2 more than second placed Brisbane.[50][51] The club failed to qualify for a second successive grand final, however, losing 5–2 on aggregate to Brisbane Roar in the Major Semi-Final and 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw with Perth Glory in the Grand Final Qualifier.[52][53] 
 [edit] Colours and badge 
 The Mariners' home jersey is predominantly navy with one yellow stripe running down the centre. The away uniform is a plain yellow jersey.[54] 
 The Mariners enjoyed considerable success in the 2005–06 away strip.[55] In twelve competitive matches, the Mariners achieved five wins, six draws and only one loss. The loss to derby rivals Newcastle was the only time the Mariners failed to score while playing away during the season.[55] 
 In the 2011–12 season, had their kits manufactured by Hummel, as the A-league's Reebok deal expired at the conclusion of the 2010–11 season. 
 In September 2012 It was announced that the Mariners had signed a 2 year deal with Kappa for them to be the official apparel supplier.[56] 
 The team logo is a yellow football at the centre of a blue curling wave, which symbolises the beaches of the Central Coast.[57] 
 [edit] Stadium 
 The Central Coast Mariners play their home games at Bluetongue Stadium, Gosford. It is located in Grahame Park, between the Gosford Central Business District and the Brisbane Water foreshore. It is constructed to make the most of its location, being open at the southern end, giving filtered views of Brisbane Water through a row of large palm trees. It is within walking distance of Gosford railway station and is adjacent to the Central Coast Leagues Club.[58] 
 Two other names for the stadium have been used during the Mariners' tenancy: Central Coast Express Advocate Stadium and Central Coast Stadium.[59][60] 
 As of December 2007, the Mariners are the only national sporting team to use the stadium. The Central Coast Rays rugby union team also used the stadium in the Australian Rugby Championship's only season in 2007. 
 While the stadium has a capacity of 20,059,[I] the Mariners highest attendance is 19,238 against Newcastle Jets in its round 19 the 2007–08 season.[61] 
 [edit] Supporters 
 The main supporter base of the Central Coast Mariners are called the Yellow Army.[62] Formerly known as the Marinators, they are a group that can often be seen at home games played at Bluetongue Stadium, Gosford but are relatively unknown in their local region.[63][64] Standard chants include the Yellow Submarine-inspired "We all follow a yellow football team", a reference to the colour of the team's kit (which is yellow).[65] 
 The Yellow Army are an informal self-identifying supporter base that is vocal at home and away games.
