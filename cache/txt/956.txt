 Hillsboro is the fifth-largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and is the county seat of Washington County.[7] Lying in the Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area, the city is home to many high-technology (high-tech) companies, such as Intel, that compose what has become known as the Silicon Forest. At the 2010 Census, the city's population was 91,611.[8] 
 For thousands of years before the arrival of European-American settlers, the Atfalati tribe of the Kalapuya lived in the Tualatin Valley near the later site of Hillsboro. The climate, moderated by marine influence from the Pacific Ocean, helped make the region suitable for fishing, hunting, food gathering, and agriculture. Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill, an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the Tualatin River was part of Hillsboro's settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four decades later. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by 1910 and about 5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s. 
 Hillsboro has a council-manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. In addition to high-tech industry, sectors important to Hillsboro's economy are health care, retail sales, and agriculture, including grapes and wineries. The city operates more than twenty parks and the mixed-use Hillsboro Stadium, and nine sites in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Modes of transportation include private vehicles, public buses and light rail, and aircraft using the Hillsboro Airport. The city is home to Pacific University's Health Professions Campus. Notable residents include two Oregon governors. 
 [edit] History 
 The first people of the Tualatin Valley were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the Kalapuya, who inhabited the region for up to 10,000 years before white settlers arrived. The valley consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning by the Atfalati, with scattered groves of trees along the streams. The Kalapuya moved from place to place in good weather to fish and hunt and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included camas and wapato, and the Atfalati traded for salmon from Chinookan tribes near Willamette Falls on the Willamette River. During the winter, they lived in longhouses in settled villages, some near what became Hillsboro and Beaverton. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18th century with Europeans, who carried smallpox, syphilis, and malaria. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000 Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the Grande Ronde reservation further west.[9] 
 The European-American community was founded by David Hill, Isaiah Kelsey, and Richard Williams, who arrived in the Tualatin Valley in 1841, followed by six more pioneers in 1842.[10] The locality went by two other names—East Tualatin Plains and Columbia—before it was named "Hillsborough" in February 1850 in honor of Hill, when he sold part of his land claim to the county.[11] On February 5, 1850, commissioners chosen by the territorial legislature selected the community to be the seat of the county government.[11] Hill was to be paid $200 for his land after plots had been sold for the town site,[11] but he died before this occurred, and his widow Lucinda received the funds.[12] The town's name was later simplified to Hillsboro. A log cabin was built in 1853 to serve as the community’s first school, which opened in October 1854.[13] Riverboats provided transportation to Hillsboro as early as 1867 when the side-wheel steamer Yamhill worked on the Tualatin River.[10] 
 In 1871, the Oregon and California Railroad line was extended to the area, but it ran just south of town because the city did not want to give the railroad land in exchange for the rail connection.[10] Hillsboro was incorporated as the Town of Hillsboro on October 19, 1876, by the Oregon Legislature.[14] The first mayor was A. Luelling, who took office on December 8, 1876, and served a one-year term.[15] Notable later mayors included Congressman Thomas H. Tongue (1882 and 1886) and state senator William D. Hare (1885).[15] On September 30, 1908, 5,000 people gathered as the Oregon Electric Railway opened a connection between the city and Portland with an interurban electric rail line, the first to reach the community.[16] In 1923, the city altered its charter and adopted a council-manager government with a six-person city council, a part-time mayor who determined major policies, and a city manager who ran day-to-day operations.[17] 
 A brick building was constructed in 1852 to house the county government, followed by a brick courthouse in 1873.[18] In 1891, the courthouse was remodeled and a clock tower was added,[19] and the building was expanded with an annex in 1912. A new courthouse replaced the brick structure in 1928. The last major remodel of the 1928 structure occurred in 1972, when the Justice Services Building was built and incorporated into the existing building.[18] 
 The city's first fire department was a hook and ladder company organized in 1880 by the board of trustees (now city council).[20] A drinking water and electricity distribution system added in 1892–93 gave the town three fire hydrants and minimal street lighting.[21] Hillsboro built its first sewer system in 1911, but sewage treatment was not added until 1936.[22] In 1913, the city built its own water system,[23] and the first library, Carnegie City Library, opened in December 1914.[24] From 1921 to 1952, the world's second-tallest radio tower stood on the south side of the city,[25] but in 1952, the wireless telegraph tower was demolished. 
 In 1972, the Hillsboro City Council passed a Green River Ordinance banning door-to-door solicitation, but it was ruled unconstitutional by the Oregon Supreme Court in a 1988 decision.[26] The court determined that the city ordinance was overly broad, in a case that was seen as a test case for many similar laws in the state.[26] In 1979, Intel opened its first facility in Hillsboro.[27] The Hawthorn Farm campus and was followed by the Jones Farm campus adjacent to the airport in 1982, and finally by the Ronler Acres campus in 1994.[27]TriMet opened a Metropolitan Area Express (MAX) light rail line into the city in 1998. A cultural center was added in 2004 and a new city hall was completed in 2005. In 2008, SolarWorld opened a facility producing solar wafers, crystals, and cells, the largest plant of its type in the Western Hemisphere.[28] 
 [edit] Registered Historic Places 
 Properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in and around Hillsboro include the Old Scotch Church, completed in 1876 north of the city.[29] Near the Orenco neighborhood is Imbrie Farm, which includes a house built in 1866 and the Frank Imbrie Barn, both of which McMenamins converted for use as a brewpub.[29][30] Built in 1935, the Harold Wass Ray House is near Intel’s Hawthorn Farm campus.[29]Historic properties in downtown include the Zula Linklater House (completed 1923), Rice-Gates House (1890), Edward Schulmerich House (c. 1915), and Charles Shorey House (c. 1908).[29] The Richard and Helen Rice House is adjacent to the Sunset Highway on the north side of the city and houses the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals.[29] The Old Washington County Jail previously was at the Washington County Fairgrounds in the city,[29] but was restored and moved to the Washington County Museum outside the city in 2004, and was de-listed from the NRHP in 2008.[31][32] In 2007, the Manning-Kamna Farm was added to the NRHP and includes 10 buildings, dating to as early as 1883.[33] 
 [edit] Geography 
 Hillsboro is located at 45°31′23″N 122°59′18″W﻿ / ﻿45.52306°N 122.98833°W﻿ / 45.52306; -122.98833﻿ (Hillsboro, Oregon).[34] The United States Census Bureau reports the city has a total area of 21.6 square miles (55.9 km2), all of which is land. In 2012, Hillsboro itself reported an area of 23.76 square miles (61.5 km2), equivalent to 15,210 acres (61.6 km2).[35] The city is located in the Tualatin Valley, and the Tualatin River forms part of the southern city limits. The city's terrain is fairly level, consistent with an agricultural past and the farms still in operation.[36][37] Hillsboro is about 17 miles (27 km) west of Portland, and immediately west of Beaverton, at an elevation of 194 feet (59 m) above sea level.[5] In addition to the Tualatin River, streams include Dairy Creek, McKay Creek, Rock Creek, Dawson Creek, and Turner Creek. Neighboring communities in addition to Beaverton are Aloha, Cornelius, North Plains, Reedville, Scholls, and West Union. 
 Hillsboro's street system differs from many others in the county.[38] Most cities in Washington County use a numbering system and cardinal direction orientation based on a grid that begins at the Willamette River in downtown Portland, which was originally part of Washington County.[38] For example, the street names in Beaverton generally include Southwest (SW) prefixes because Beaverton lies in the southwest quadrant of the Portland grid. In Hillsboro, some county road names and addresses conform to the Portland grid instead of Hillsboro's internal cardinal direction grid,[39] and the city has been working to make addresses and streets within Hillsboro conform to the internal grid.[39][40] 
 The internal grid in Hillsboro centers on the downtown intersection of Main Street, which runs east–west, and First Avenue, which runs north–south. Most addresses within the city include a quadrant prefix: NW, NE, SW, or SE. Main Street is simply designated as East Main or West Main, and First Avenue is only North First or South First.[41] Addresses on the streets' south side and the avenues' east side have even numbers, while odd numbers are on the opposite side.[41] Hillsboro’s street system contains 20 blocks per mile (12.5 blocks per kilometer).[41] 
 North–south through roadways are called avenues, while east–west roadways are called streets.[42] All cul-de-sacs are named as either places or courts.[42] Roads that curve can be named drives.[42] Non-city streets may not conform to these naming conventions.[39] 
 The city is divided into eight planning areas, each of which contains several neighborhoods.[43] The east planning area contains the Tanasbourne neighborhood and Oregon Health &amp; Science University's West Campus.[43] The northeast planning area includes the Orenco, Orenco Station, Airport, and West Union neighborhoods.[43] Jackson School, Sunrise, and Glencoe neighborhoods lie in the northwest area,[43] and the Dennis, Garibaldi, and Connell neighborhoods are in the west area.[43] The central area includes the Downtown, Jackson Bottom, Henry, and Eastwood neighborhoods.[43] Blocks in the downtown core are 400 feet (120 m) long on each side.[44] The Minter Bridge, Rood Bridge, and River Road neighborhoods are in the south planning area;[43] the southeast area consists of the Reedville and Witch Hazel neighborhoods,[43] and the Brookwood planning area in the center of the city contains the Cedar, Bentley, and Brogden neighborhoods.[43] 
 Landmarks in Hillsboro include the Washington County Courthouse, the seat of county government.[45] Along the western edge of the city is Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery, established in 1870, the final resting place of city pioneers and politicians.[46] Next to the airport is the Washington County Fair Complex, home to the annual county fair.[47] Located at Shute Park is the 25-foot (7.6 m) tall wood sculpture "Chief Kno–Tah", donated to Hillsboro and dedicated in 1987 as part of Peter Wolf Toth's Trail of the Whispering Giants.[48][49][50][51] 
 [edit] Climate 
 Summers in Hillsboro are generally warm, but temperatures year-round are moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean.[52] The Willamette Valley in which Hillsboro lies receives the majority of its precipitation during the winter months, with the wettest period from November through March.[52] This occasionally includes snowfall.[53] Hillsboro receives precipitation on 161 days per year, on average.[54] The average yearly precipitation between 1930 and 1998 was 38 inches (970 mm).[55] August is the warmest month with an average high temperature of 81 °F (27 °C), while January is the coolest month with an average high of 46 °F (8 °C).[56] The highest recorded temperature, 108 °F (42 °C), occurred on July 19, 1956, and the lowest, −10 °F (−23 °C), occurred on January 31, 1950.[56]

The Hillsboro libraries are part of Washington County Cooperative Library Services, which allows residents to use other libraries in the county and includes interlibrary loans.[105] 
 AM radio station KUIK, the twice-weekly Hillsboro Argus newspaper, and the Hillsboro Tribune are based in Hillsboro. The Argus is published on Tuesday and Friday, and has been in circulation since 1873.[106] KUIK is a 5,000-watt station broadcasting at the 1360 frequency. The Tribune started in September 2012 and publishes twice per month.[107] The city is also served by Portland area media outlets including The Oregonian, Willamette Week, and all broadcast stations.[59]  
 [edit] Recreation 
 Hillsboro's Department of Parks and Recreation operates more than 20 facilities, including Hillsboro Stadium. There are 23 parks, two sports complexes, the Walters Cultural Arts Center, the Shute Park Aquatic &amp; Recreation Center, and three other mixed-use facilities.[108] The city also owns the Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve along the Tualatin River on the south side of the community.[109][110] South of city is Bald Peak State Scenic Viewpoint, which is day-use only, and is the closest state park to Hillsboro. L.L. "Stub" Stewart Memorial State Park is the closest full-service state park. 
 Local golf courses include The Reserve Vineyards &amp; Golf Club (36 holes) that was completed in 1997, Meriwether National Golf Course (27 holes) established in 1961, and the 9-hole McKay Creek Golf Course that was built in 1995.[110] Other courses in the area include Killarney West Golf Club (9 holes), Rock Creek Country Club (18 holes), Forest Hills Country Club (18 holes), and Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club (36 holes). 
 Hillsboro's annual Fourth of July Parade is the second-largest Independence Day parade in Oregon.[111][112] The Oregon International Air Show, Oregon's largest air show, is held each year during the summer at the Hillsboro Airport.[62] Each summer the city offers a free concert series at Shute Park (Showtime at Shute),[113] while the Washington County Fair is held annually at the county fairgrounds adjacent to the airport.[114] 
 Two farmers' markets operate in the city, a Saturday one in downtown and a Sunday one in Orenco Station, both operating from May to October.[62] The Saturday market began in 1982 and sells arts and crafts, food, produce, and plants.[115] On Tuesdays during the summer, the Hillsboro Markets operates a market that sells craftwork, food, and artwork downtown.[62] Additionally, a similar market operates on Wednesdays from June through August in the Tanasbourne neighborhood.[116] 
 The city has one professional sports team, the Hillsboro Hops of the Northwest League. The baseball team relocated from Yakima, Washington in 2012 and begins play at Hillsboro baseball stadium for the 2013 Minor League Baseball season.[117] 
 [edit] Government 
 Hillsboro operates under a council-manager form of city government. Voters elect six at-large councilors and a mayor, who each serve four-year terms, subject to a charter-imposed limitation of two consecutive terms.[118] The mayor and council appoint a city manager to conduct the ordinary business of the city. Policy decisions are the responsibility of the council and mayor. Administrative functions are carried out by the manager and manager-appointed staff.[119] Government functions are centered at the Hillsboro Civic Center, which houses the office of the city manager and is the location of the twice-monthly city council meetings.[118] As of January 2011, Jerry Willey was mayor with Nenice Andrews, Aron Carleson, Darell Lumaco, Steve Callaway, Olga Acuña, and Mike Castillo as the city counselors.[120] Michael Brown serves as the city's manager.[121] 
 Hillsboro operates its own library system, fire department, parks department, water system, and police department.[59] The Hillsboro Fire Department has five stations, and the Hillsboro Police Department operates two standard precincts and a mobile precinct.[59][122][123] Wastewater treatment is provided through the county-wide Clean Water Services. 
 At the federal level, Hillsboro lies in Oregon's 1st congressional district, represented by Suzanne Bonamici.[124] In the State Senate, Hillsboro is in District 15, represented by (Bruce Starr), and District 13, represented by (Larry George), abuts to the south. In the House, Districts 29 (Katie Eyre Brewer) and 30 (Shawn Lindsay) cover the city.[125] Parts of county commissioner districts 1 (Dick Schouten), 2 (Desari Strader), and 4 (Andy Duyck) overlap the city.[126] In addition, Hillsboro lies within District 4 (Kathryn Harrington) of the Metro regional government.[127] 
 [edit] Education 
 Public schools in Hillsboro are operated by the Hillsboro School District (1J). The district is a unified school district with twenty-three elementary schools, four middle schools, and four high schools.[62] The district also operates the Miller Education Center, an alternative school, the Hare Field athletic complex, and City View Charter School.[128] The school district covers Hillsboro, Scholls, Reedville, North Plains, West Union, and other surrounding communities.[62] Total enrollment as of 2008 was 20,543 students, making it the fourth largest district in the state.[129] The four traditional public high schools are, in order of creation: 
 Post-secondary educational opportunities include the west campus of Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU)[134] and the Portland West satellite campus of the Oregon Institute of Technology.[135] The OHSU site was formerly that of the Oregon Graduate Institute (now OGI School of Science and Engineering) and the Oregon National Primate Research Center portions of OHSU. The OHSU and OIT campuses are located in the Tanasbourne neighborhood. Pacific University operates a satellite Health Professions Campus in downtown adjacent to Tuality Community Hospital.[62] Other educational opportunities are available at the Work Force Training Center (Capital Center) and a branch of the University of Phoenix, both located in Tanasbourne. Hillsboro is home to private primary and secondary schools including Faith Bible High School, St. Matthew Catholic School, Tualatin Valley Academy, Swallowtail School, and Renaissance Alternative School, among others.[136] 
 [edit] Infrastructure 
 [edit] Transportation 
 Public transportation is available by bus and light rail, managed by regional transit agency TriMet.[62] The first MAX light rail line, now known as the Blue Line, was extended to serve Hillsboro on September 12, 1998.[137] The western terminus is located downtown. The Willow Creek and Hillsboro transit centers (TC) are the main hubs of the public transit system, although seven other MAX stations provide varying degrees of bus interconnection. MAX Stations (west to east) are the Hatfield Government Center, Hillsboro Central TC, Tuality Hospital, Washington/Southeast 12th Avenue, Fair Complex / Hillsboro Airport, Hawthorn Farm, Orenco, Quatama, and Willow Creek TC. Located next to the Tuality Hospital station is the Hillsboro Intermodal Transit Facility, which opened in 2010 and was jointly paid for by the hospital, Pacific University, and the city.[138] The facility is primarily a parking garage, but includes lockers and showers for bicyclists along with electric vehicle charging stations.[139] 
 Freight rail service from Portland and Western Railroad with interconnections to the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad both serve Hillsboro.[140] The city is not served by passenger rail service over a heavy-rail line.[59] Air travel is available at the Hillsboro Airport in the center of the city and at Stark's Twin Oaks Airpark, a general aviation field south of the city. The Hillsboro Airport is a general aviation airport operated by the Port of Portland, and is the second-busiest airport in the state after Portland International Airport.[141] The airport mainly serves private pilots and corporate flights, with no scheduled airline flights from its two runways, but does have an on-call customs service.[59][142] 
 Oregon Route 8, known locally as the Tualatin Valley Highway (TV Highway), is the primary east–west highway.[73]U.S. Route 26, also known as the Sunset Highway, bisects the northeast corner of the city. Other major east–west roads are Cornell Road and Main Street / Baseline Road.[59] Major north–south routes are Oregon Route 219 / 1st Street, 10th Street / Cornell Road, Cornelius Pass Road, and Brookwood.[59] The easternmost north–south route, 185th Avenue, borders Beaverton and runs between the Tanasbourne Town Center and the rest of Hillsboro. TV Highway connects to Cornelius and Forest Grove to the west and Beaverton to the east. 
 [edit] Health care 
 Hospital services in the city are provided by Tuality Community Hospital in the downtown area of the city.[62] Opened in 1918 as the city's first hospital,[143] the 167-bed facility is operated by Tuality Healthcare. Other significant medical facilities include Kaiser Permanente's Sunset Medical Office and Providence Health &amp; Services' immediate care center, both in the Tanasbourne neighborhood. Kaiser Permanente received approval in 2007 to build a hospital at the site of its existing medical office in Tanasbourne.[144] Estimated to cost $242 million, the Kaiser Westside Medical Center will start with 126 beds with a planned capacity of 174 beds when fully built.[145] The Department of Veterans Affairs opened a medical clinic in the Tanasbourne area in 2008.[146] 
 [edit] Notable people 
 For more than 150 years, the city has had residents as varied as David Hill, the city's founder, to Tiffeny Milbrett, an Olympic and World Cup champion soccer player.[147] Two governors of Oregon, James Withycombe and Paul L. Patterson, have called the city home.[148] Other politicians included Congressmen Thomas H. Tongue and Samuel Thurston; mayors William N. Barrett, Benjamin P. Cornelius, and William D. Hare, patriarch of the Hare political family.[46] Athletes include Erik Ainge, Scott Brosius, Ad Rutschman, Wes Schulmerich, Wally Backman, and Olympic medalists Josh Inman, Thomas Garrigus, and Jean Saubert. Hillsboro has also been home to Peggy Y. Fowler, the former chief executive officer of Portland General Electric, producer Bryce Zabel, the "Mother Queen of Oregon" Mary Ramsey Wood, Tommy Overstreet, and professional wrestler Roddy Piper.[149] 
 [edit] Sister city 
 Hillsboro's only sister city relationship is with Fukuroi,[150] a city of about 85,000 residents in the Shizuoka Prefecture in central Japan. The cities, which have similar economic bases in agriculture and high technology, began their relationship in November 1988.[151] The relationship has included exchanges of students between schools in each city.[152] In the late 2000s decade, Hillsboro unsuccessfully explored finding a sister city in Mexico[153] and also neglected the relationship with Fukuroi.[154] However, in 2008, a Fukuroi contingent of adults visited Hillsboro to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Sister City agreement, and a youth contingent is visiting in 2009.[155]
