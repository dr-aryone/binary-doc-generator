  
 Ed, Edd n Eddy is a Canadian-American animated comedy television series created by Danny Antonucci and produced by Canada-based a.k.a. Cartoon. It premiered on Cartoon Network on January 4, 1999. The series was designed to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s, and revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds", who live in a suburban cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments. 
 Before signing a contract with Cartoon Network, Antonucci approached Nickelodeon with the show, but the channel demanded creative control of the show, which Antonucci did not agree to. During the show's run on Cartoon Network, several specials and shorts were produced in addition to the regular television series, as well as two books. Several comic books or video games either based on the series or featuring the series' characters have been produced. The series' TV movie finale, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series. 
 Ed, Edd n Eddy received generally positive reviews from critics. The show attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 29 countries, and was popular among children and adults. It received several awards and nominations during its 10-year run and remains the longest-running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian-made animated series to date, and is also one of the longest-running United States animated series. 
 Series overview 
 Ed, Edd n Eddy follows the lives of three adolescent boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities. In the pursuit of buying jawbreakers and fitting in with the other kids, dimwitted Ed and intellectual Edd aid the self-appointed leader, Eddy, in his plans to scam the other children in their cul-de-sac out of their money; however problems always ensue. The other children mostly dislike or show indifference to the Eds, though they all share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, a group of teenage girls who live in a nearby trailer park. The series takes place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced. The first four seasons of the show are set during a perpetual summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters were shown going to school in fall and winter. 
 Characters 
 Ed is the strong, dimwitted workhorse of the group. Edd, better known as Double D, is an inventor, neat freak, and the most intelligent of the Eds. Eddy is a greedy, ill-tempered con artist, loudmouth, and self-appointed leader of the Eds. Jonny 2 × 4 is a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance; he spends most of his time with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank. Jimmy is a weak, effeminate, and insecure child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah, Ed's bossy, spoiled, and short-tempered younger sister. Rolf is an immigrant, who often participates in odd customs and eats strange food. Kevin is a stereotypical, cynical, and sarcastic jock who hates the Eds and can be cruel at times. Nazz, usually seen with Kevin, is a stereotypical and unattainable love interest. May, Marie, and Lee Kanker, better known as the "Kanker Sisters", are the main antagonists of the series and are in love with the three Eds. 
 Aside from the Eds, the other characters in the cul-de-sac, and the Kanker Sisters, no other characters appeared in the series until the fifth season, when the silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in one episode the arms of Eddy’s father and Ed’s mother were seen. In the series finale, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, Eddy’s adult brother was seen for the first time, making him the only non-main character, and the only adult character to ever fully appear on the show. 
 History 
 Creation 
 Having grown tired of working as an animator on various children cartoons for Hanna-Barbera, cartoonist Danny Antonucci, bothered by people thinking animation is only for children, went on to create gross and edgy adult work such as his short Lupo the Butcher and his MTV series The Brothers Grunt.[1] Someone dared Antonucci to produce a children cartoon, a challenge he accepted.[2] Designing a commercial, Antonucci ended up drawing three character named Ed, Edd and Eddy.[2] Impressed, Antonucci began developing the characters and after months of designing, sent a one-page fax to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.[2] Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network notably in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic, wanting to see more; however they each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused.[1] A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission the show, after they agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show.[1] 
 Production 
 Antonucci, an advocate of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to the cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s; the series was the last to use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio.[1] To give the impression of movement, Ed, Edd n Eddy uses shimmering, character outlines, or "boling lines", which have been compared to squigglevision.[3][4] The boiling lines are not as noticeable as those in Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, but are still visible,[5] and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.[1] The boling line is created by tracing off a drawing three times through sheets of paper.[2] Antonucci believes it "helps keep the characters alive" and also wanted to depart from other Cartoon Network series and pay homage to the classic cartoon era.[2][1] 
 According to Antonucci, he based the characters on real people in his life; the personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on his own traits, and the activities of his two sons while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with.[6] Rolf is based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living.[6] Rolf is based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.[7] Jimmy is based on one of his cousins, who spent most of his time playing with girls than boys and was rather feminine.[2] Rolf Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket.[2] He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do.[6] Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.[2] 
 All the children have multicolored tongues; Antonucci said that the idea came after he saw his son and his friends with different-colored tongues because of eating different candy while he was working on a storyboard.[2] The characters went through a number of "walking cycles", a process used to determine how each character should walk or run, turn around, blink, etc. before the crew came up with the final product.[2] 
 Although the series was set to air for four seasons, two additional seasons and three holiday-themed specials were ordered[8] as a result of its popularity.[3] The series' finale movie, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, aired on November 8, 2009, and officially ended the series.[9] However, reruns continued on Cartoon Network, and on April 6, 2012, also began to air as part of the revived block Cartoon Planet.[10] 
 Casting 
 Matt Hill, Samuel Vincent and Tony Sampson were cast as Ed, Edd and Eddy. David Paul Grove and Keenan Christenson played the parts of Jonny 2 × 4 and Jimmy, respectively, while Sarah was voiced by Janyse Jaud. Peter Kelamis voiced Rolf, while Kathleen Barr was cast as Kevin. Nazz was voiced by Tabitha St. Germain in season 1, Jenn Forgie in season 3 and Erin Fitzgerald in seasons 2, 4, 5 and 6. Fitzgerald also played the part of May, one of the Kanker Sisters, except in season 3 when she was voiced by Jenn Forgie. The other two Kanker sisters, Marie and Lee, were voiced by Kathleen Barr and Janyse Jaud. Eddy's adult brother is mentioned frequently throughout the series but does not appear until Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, where he is voiced by Terry Klassen.[11] 
 Music and title sequence 
 Antonucci showed the theme song to the studios when first pitching the series, thinking it would be better than only looking at drawings.[2] It was inspired by the Bob Crosby and The Big Cats song "Big Noise from Winnetka", which was whistled, something Antonucci enjoyed doing as a child.[2] Composed by Patric Caird, who created all the music in the series, while Antonucci performed the whistling himself.[2] The title sequence was created by Paul Boyd.[12] 
 Death of Paul Boyd 
 Since early age, Boyd was diagnosed with bipolar disorder or manic depression.[13] During the evening of August 13, 2007, Boyd, who according to news reports had not taken his medication for his that day , suffered a manic episode in the middle of a busy intersection. Vancouver police arrived on the scene in response to a 911 call regarding a man carrying a potentially lethal weapon and confronted Boyd, who witnesses say was wielding a bicycle chain.[13] After injuring two officers with the chain, a third officer, Constable Lee Chipperfield, fired at Boyd in self-defense, killing him.[13] Nine shots were fired total, with six hitting Boyd and the final shot striking him in the head. Controversy erupted over whether or not the officer's use of lethal force was appropriate, and an investigation was raised.[13] In March 2012, the British Columbia police complaint commissioner issued a report concluding that there was not "clear, convincing and cogent evidence ... that Chipperfield used unnecessary force or excessive force during his incident."[14] 
 In May 2012, video captured by a tourist surfaced. In the video, which starts after the seventh shot was fired, Boyd is seen crawling on the road, unarmed. Another officer is seen retrieving Boyd's bicycle chain in the time between the eighth and ninth shots, after which Boyd was killed by a shot to the head.[15] David Eby, executive director of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, said that the video made it clear that Boyd did not pose a threat to anyone at the time the fatal bullet was fired.[15] In light of the new evidence, an independent investigative agency was brought up to review the case with the new video in consideration.[15] 
 Antonucci commented on the death of Boyd and the footage, saying: "I still, after five years, do not understand this. And I don't understand why there hasn't been some sort of justice brought upon this. That video is absolutely heart-breaking. It's heart-breaking. To see Paul crawling on his hands and knees and to have some ignorant person shoot a gun into his head, I mean, it's just insane."[13] 
 Episodes 
 Hallmarks 
 Special episodes 
 Along with an additional fifth and sixth season, Cartoon Network ordered three holiday specials that originally aired in 2004 and 2005.[8] "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle", the first, is a Christmas special originally aired on December 3, 2004,[16] and re-aired on December 14, 2011, as part of Cartoon Network's Christmas programming.[17]Valentine's Day's "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Hanky Panky Hullabaloo" originally aired on February 11, 2005, and re-aired on Valentine's Day of the same year.[18] The final, Halloween special, "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Boo Haw Haw" aired on October 28, 2007.[19] Antonucci stated that "Boo Haw Haw" was one of his favorite Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes that he worked on.[20] On May 11, 2007, a fourth special, "The Eds are Coming, the Eds are Coming" aired; however, it was not a holiday special, but an adjunct to other Cartoon Network series Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Camp Lazlo, and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy in the alien-themed mini-series Cartoon Network Invaded that aired all five specials from May 4 to May 28, 2007.[21] 
 Shorts and marathons 
 Cartoon Network has also produced short cartoons involving the Eds which were shown during commercial breaks. A short music video was produced with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy and Sarah, entitled "The Incredible Shrinking Day" (listed on the Season 2 DVD as "I'm Not Coming in Anymore"),[2] which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video, Sarah uses a potion to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her dollhouse, with predictable results.[22] Plank starred in a similar video called "My Best Friend Plank", which aired in 2002.[23] 
 Cartoon Network aired several all day marathons for either commercial promotions or special airings for one of their shows. The six-hour "Ed's Day Off Marathon" aired 22 episodes on January 19, 2004, in celebration Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.[24] "The Best Day Edder", in which every episode was shown in chronological order, aired from April 27 to April 28, 2007, and ended with the previously never broadcast last episode of season 5, which was promoted as the "final episode ever".[25] However, it was quickly followed by "The Eds are Coming, the Eds are Coming" in the next month.[21] As of June 14, 2007, "The Best Day Edder" provided Cartoon Network their best ratings of the year.[26] A seven hour Sunday marathon, which aired before the premiere of Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, posted double-digit delivery gains among children ages 9-14 (up 14%), boys ages 9-14 (up 16%) and girls ages 6-11 (up 17%), compared to the same time frame last year, highlighting the network's weekend performance.[27] 
 Appearances in other series or works 
 Besides their own series, Ed, Edd and Eddy have also appeared in other cartoon series. They appeared in an episode of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends and were drawn using that series' style of animation,[28] and made a short cameo in "The Grim Adventures of the KND"; a crossover of The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy and Codename: Kids Next Door. They also appeared on a small crossover poster during its credits entitled Ed, Edd n Mandy.[29] 
 In 2004, the Eds appeared in a short series of basketball commercials with NBA All-Star Steve Francis.[30] Ed appeared in the "Cartoon Network Elections 2004" with Grim from The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy as a team, and they ended up winning, due to the highest number of votes by viewers.[31] A live action web series based on Ed, Edd n Eddy and a spin-off of The Walking Dead titled The Walking ED is currently in pre-production.[32] 
 Reception, legacy, and achievements 
 Ratings and run length achievements 
 Ed, Edd n Eddy attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 29 countries, and was popular among both children and adults.[9] It was Cartoon Network's most popular show among boys ages 2–11.[33] In 2005, it was reported that Ed, Edd n Eddy was the number one rated show on Cartoon Network and basic cable with huge awareness, being known to 79% of children age 6–11.[34] The series ran for nearly 11 years, making it the longest-running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian‌-made animated series to date.[9][35] It is one of the longest-running United States animated series. 
 Critical reception 
 Ed, Edd n Eddy received generally positive reviews from critics. David Cornelius considered the Eds to be adolescent equivalents of The Three Stooges, believing that "the series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily."[36] Cornelius also wrote that the "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated."[36] Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine considered every second of the show "filler" and lamented that the main characters are drawn as "products from the school of acid-trip caricature."[37] After Briggs' review was published, a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to "take a second look" at the show. Different reviewers then gave it a positive review, calling it a "fresh show with very different approaches."[5] ToonZone gave Ed, Edd n Eddy multiple reviews; In a season two review, Bird Boy praised the show's "strong" writing, "tight" animation and character designs and "excellent" stories, writing: "Perhaps the greatest thing about Ed, Edd n Eddy is how well it holds up to this day. It still feels 'new' and it's a ton of fun to watch, for the young and old. I really can't wait for the other seasons of this show to arrive on DVD—it's great rewatching it after all of these years."[38] In an episode review, Killtacular called the show "the best cartoon Cartoon Network has ever offered."[39] 
 Accolades 
 During its run, Ed, Edd n Eddy was nominated for a Reuben Award, six Leo Awards, an Annie Award, two Kids' Choice Awards and a SOCAN Award, winning the Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and the SOCAN Award. ToonZone ranked Ed, Edd n Eddy third on their "Toons of the 2000s: Top 5 Cartoon Network Originals".[40] It was ranked seventh on ScrewAttack's "Top Twenty Cartoon Network Shows".[41] The web-based comedy duo Smosh listed Ed, Edd n Eddy on their list of "9 Cartoons That Need A Reboot".[42] Bob Higgins, head of creative at Wild Brain, considered Ed, Edd n Eddy to be a "landmark in animation".[43]
