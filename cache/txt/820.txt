  
 The Amos Tuck School of Business Administration (or the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, as it is now called) is the graduate business school of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, in the United States. Founded in 1900, Tuck is the oldest graduate school of business in the world, and was the first institution to offer master's degrees in the field of business administration.[5][6][7][8] Tuck is one of six Ivy League business schools and it consistently ranks in the top five in many business school rankings.[9] 
 Tuck grants only one degree, the Master of Business Administration (MBA), alongside shorter programs for executives and recent college graduates, although there are opportunities for dual degrees with other institutions. The school places a heavy emphasis on its tight-knit and residential character, and has a student population that hovers near 500 students and a full-time faculty of 46.[10] Tuck claims over 8,400 living alumni in a variety of fields, with the highest rate of alumni donation of any business school. 
 [edit] History 
 At the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth College president William Jewett Tucker decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world.[11] Turning to his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Tucker enlisted the support of Edward Tuck, who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist.[12] Tuck donated $300,000 in the form of preferred stock shares in a Minnesota railroad company as the capital to found the school. It was named the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, after Edward Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus Amos Tuck.[12] 
 The new school's annual tuition was $100 for the few students who enrolled in the first year; graduates of the two-year program received a Master of Commercial Science degree (MCS).[1][12] The curriculum involved both traditional liberal arts fields as well as economic and finance education.[11] Undergraduate professors taught most of the first-year courses, while outside guest instructors and businesspeople educated students in their second years.[11][12] As the nation's first graduate school of business, the Tuck School's emphasis on a broad education in general management was adopted by many other emerging business schools, and was dubbed the "Tuck Pattern".[11][12] 
 In the late 1920s, Dartmouth president Ernest Martin Hopkins sought to unify the Tuck School by establishing a central campus, uniting the school's academic and residential facilities. Edward Tuck, then an aged man living in France, donated an additional $570,000 for the effort.[12] Using primarily his funds, four new buildings were constructed in 1929 on the west side of Dartmouth's campus.[12][13] 
 In 1942, the school's name changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed to the modern Master of Business Administration (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered primarily to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year.[12] Under Dean Karl Hill (1957–1960), Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion under Dean John Hennessey (1968–1976) in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus with the construction of a new dormitory (1969) and the Murdough Center (1973), which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library. Under Deans Richard West (1976–1983) and Colin Blaydon (1983–1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third.[12] Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several research centers and nondegree business programs.[1] 
 [edit] Campus 
 The Tuck School is located on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is situated in the rural, Upper Connecticut River Valley, New England town of Hanover, New Hampshire. The campus of the Tuck School sits in a complex on the west side of Dartmouth's campus, near the Connecticut River.[14] Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building facing the Green at the center of the campus;[15] in 1930, the institution moved into Stell, Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall.[13][16][17][18] Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck's eight academic and administrative buildings.[14] 
 Tuck emphasizes its residential character, describing residential life as "a foundation of the Tuck culture" and crediting it as "a reason that Tuck alumni are among the most loyal of all the business school [sic] in the world."[14][19] Tuck's isolated location has been described as an "image problem" for attracting successful applicants and faculty to its rural campus,[20] although some students cite the school's relatively insular character as a positive trait for fostering intimacy and friendship.[21] 
 Tuck has three residential facilities: Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000), Achtmeyer Hall (constructed 2008) and Pineau-Valencienne (constructed 2008). The newer residence halls and Raether Hall are part of the Tuck Living and Learning Complex, which houses 85 additional students as well as classrooms and study space. At a total cost of $27.2 million, the Tuck LLC was completed in December 2008.[22] The Tuck School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library) with the adjacent Thayer School of Engineering.[23] The Tuck campus is serviced by Byrne Hall, a dining facility operated by Dartmouth Dining Services.[24] 
 Buchanan Hall (constructed 1968) was renovated in 2009 to convert it from a student residence hall to a combined faculty research facility and executive residence. Over the next 5 years, Tuck plans to add up to 10 new full-time faculty members and Buchanan Hall will house the added offices.[25] 
 [edit] Academics 
 The Tuck School offers only a single degree: the two-year, full-time Master of Business Administration (MBA). First-year MBA students at Tuck undertake a 32-week core curriculum in general management and a specialized First Year Project.[3][27][28] During their second year, students take 12 elective courses and design their own focused field of study.[29][30] 
 The school stresses a collaborative and teamwork-based approach to learning, which it touts as one of its assets for "building the interpersonal skills required for business leadership."[19] However, this emphasis on cooperative group learning has been criticized as too "touchy-feely" for students entering the competitive business world, and the emphasis on consensus-building as detrimental to students' ability to make quick, independent decisions.[20] The school's academic programs have also been criticized for not offering their students a broader international perspective, though the school has sought to remedy this by offering globally oriented courses, programs, and research.[20][31][32] 
 Students seeking other degrees can engage in one of seven dual-degree or joint-degree programs offered in conjunction with other academic institutions. Dual degrees include an MBA/Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, an MBA/Master of Public Affairs from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, an MBA/Master of Studies in Environmental Law from the Vermont Law School, and an MBA/Master of Arts from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Joint degrees include a Doctor of Medicine/MBA from Dartmouth Medical School, a Master of Public Health/MBA from the Dartmouth's Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences, and a Master of Engineering Management/MBA from Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering.[33] The school also offers a variety of second-year exchange programs at other institutions such as the Handelshochschule Leipzig in Germany, the HEC School of Management and the ESSEC Business School in Paris, IESE Business School in Barcelona, and the London Business School.[34] 
 In addition to the MBA program, the school also offers an array of executive education and other non-degree programs, such as the Tuck Business Bridge Program for competitive current and recent university undergraduates, and the Leadership Education and Development (LEAD) program for high school students.[10] 
 [edit] Organization and research 
 Like the undergraduate portion of Dartmouth College, the Tuck School operates on a quarter system.[35] As part of the larger institution, the Tuck School is ultimately administered by Dartmouth's President and Board of Trustees. The school is directly managed by a Dean (currently Paul Danos) who is advised by a Board of Overseers that was established in 1951.[36] 
 Since the Tuck School offers only one degree, it does not contain formal academic departments as do other institutions. Instead, faculty are generally grouped in one or more of seven "academic areas": accounting, finance and economics, marketing, operations management and management science, strategy and management, international business, and management communication.[37] Tuck is also home to five research centers which organize research in different fields of business administration. The centers are meant to promote faculty research, establish liaisons between the Tuck School and the corporate world, and sponsor programs for Tuck as a whole; MBA students are occasionally invited to participate as fellows and research associates.[38] The five research centers are the William F. Achtmeyer Center for Global Leadership, the Center for Corporate Governance, the Center for International Business, the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship, and the Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies.[38] 
 [edit] Admissions and rankings 
 Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business is consistently ranked among the top MBA programs, both nationally and internationally. In 2011, it was ranked first internationally among full-time programs by [47]The Economist, up from second in 2010.[48]The Wall Street Journal[49] and Forbes[50] also have ranked Tuck first in recent years (2007). Tuck is ranked seventh by U.S. News &amp; World Report,[51][52] eighth by the Financial Times (2008),[53] and eleventh (in 2006) by Bloomberg BusinessWeek.[9] In international ranking analyses in which all the different ranking bodies are combined, Tuck's median score consistently places it as one of the top three business schools if not the top business school in the world.[54] It is also a member of the Global Business School Network. In the 2010 QS Global 200 Business Schools Report[55] Tuck School of Business was indexed as the #14 business school in North America. 
 In the most recent aggregated "ranking of rankings" of US business schools, Tuck ranked #2 in the Financial Times and #8 with Poets&amp;Quants. Each of these rankings is a composite of five major MBA rankings published by Bloomberg BusinessWeek, The Economist, The Financial Times, Forbes, Wall Street Journal and/or U.S. News &amp; World Report which is meant to eliminate anomalies and other statistical distortions that are often present in any single ranking.[56][57] 
 Applicants to the Tuck School come from many different backgrounds and institutions and are evaluated based on undergraduate academic performance, Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) standardized test scores, English test scores for international applicants, essays, 2 letters of recommendation, written applications, and interviews, if applicable. Prior work and real-world experience and success is also considered in evaluating potential candidates.[3][58] 2,276 applicants applied for approximately 240 slots in the class of 2009. The average GMAT score of students was 710, the average age was 27 and the average undergraduate grade point average (GPA) of American students was 3.4.[59] 
 [edit] People 
 [edit] Student profile 
 Tuck students, known as "Tuckies", typically number about 500 students in two classes, with international students making up about 34% of the student body.[4][19][20] The school has growing percentages of women (34%) and minorities (19%). In the past as has been the case with many business schools the student body makeup has been criticized as a weakness by students who desire more diversity in the school.[4][21][60] Tuck has tried to address these shortcomings by offering additional scholarships to minority applicants and by promoting such programs as the annual Tuck Diversity Conference and participation in the Forté Foundation for women in business.[20][61][62] 
 Like many other business schools, Tuck encourages its students to have post-undergraduate work experience before applying to the MBA program.[63][64] The average incoming student has five years of full-time work experience, and the average student age is 28, ranging from 25 to 32 years.[4][60] 
 [edit] Alumni 
 Tuck claims the highest percentage of alumni donors of any business school in the world.[65] It is the only business school in BusinessWeek's study of American business schools to have at least 50% of its alumni contribute to their alma mater's annual funds, with 66% making donations.[65] The most popular career industries for graduates are management consulting (40%) and finance/accounting (37%), with graduates' annual base salaries averaging $100,000.[66] 
 Alumni of Tuck's MBA program who are prominent in business include entrepreneur Jim Butterworth,[67] entrepreneur John Bello T'74, founder of SoBe Beverages and former President of National Football League Properties, [68] former Bristol-Myers Squibb CEO Peter R. Dolan '80,[69]Causeway Capital Management, LLC CEO Sarah Ketterer T'87, current Tuck School Board of Overseers Chairman and Parthenon Group Co-Founder William F. Achtmeyer '81, Digital Angel CEO Kevin McGrath '77,[70] and former PepsiCo CEO Christopher A. Sinclair '73.[71] In education, David T. McLaughlin '55 served as the president of Dartmouth College,[72] and Robert Witt '65 as the president of the University of Alabama.[73] Alumni in other fields include screenwriter and director Kamran Pasha '00,[74] U.S. Representative Herman T. Schneebeli '31,[75] and former XFL football player Kyle Schroeder '07.[76] Alumni of Tuck's Executive Training program include The New York Times Company president and CEO Janet L. Robinson '96,[77]Zurich Financial Services CEO James Schiro [78] and graphic designer David R. Brown.[79] 
 [edit] Faculty 
 As of the 2007–2008 school year, the Tuck School employs 46 full-time faculty members and currently maintains a student-faculty ratio of 9:1.[3][60] Among Tuck's notable professors and instructors are Professor of Economics Andrew Bernard, Professor of Marketing Kevin Lane Keller, Professor of Finance Kenneth French, Professor of International Economics Matthew J. Slaughter, Professor of International Business Vijay Govindarajan, Professor of Strategic Management Richard D'Aveni, and Professor of Operations Management M. Eric Johnson.[80] Former faculty include industrial efficiency pioneer Frederick Winslow Taylor,[81] marketing professor Brian Wansink,[82] and Michael Jensen, who taught as a visiting scholar.[83] Notably, investment banker Paul D. Paganucci taught at the Tuck School from 1972 to 1986.
