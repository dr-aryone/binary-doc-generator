 Birchington-on-Sea is a village in northeast Kent, England, with a population of around 9,800. It is part of the Thanet district and forms the civil parish of Birchington. It lies on the coast facing the North Sea, east of the Thames Estuary, between the seaside resorts of Herne Bay and Margate. 
 As a seaside resort, the village is a notable tourist and retirement destination. The village's Minnis Bay is a family beach with attractions such as sailing, windsurfing, a paddling pool and coastal walking routes. Its three smaller beaches are surrounded by chalk cliffs, cliff stacks and caves. 
 The village was first recorded in 1240. Its parish church, All Saints', dates to the 13th century and its churchyard is the burial place of the 19th century Pre-Raphaelite artist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Quex Park, a local 19th century manor house, is home to the Powell Cotton Museum and a twelve-bell tower built for change ringing. The museum contains a large collection of stuffed exotic animals collected by Major Powell-Cotton on his travels in Africa, and also houses artifacts unearthed in and around Birchington by his daughter, Antoinette Powell-Cotton, a keen archeologist. 
 [edit] History 
 Birchington was first recorded in 1240 as Birchenton, a name derived from the Old English words 'bircen tun', meaning a farm where birch trees grow.[1] Archaeological evidence has shown the area was inhabited before the existence of the village: Roman and prehistoric artefacts have been discovered in the area, and Minnis Bay was once the site of an Iron Age settlement.[2] 
 Archives show the village's All Saints' Church dates to around 1350.[3] In the early 15th century, Quex Park manor house—named after the park's second owner, John Quek—was built just south of the village.[2] The ownership of the manor passed to various families until 1770 when it was acquired by the present owners, the Powell family.[4] In the late 17th century, the house was visited by King William III.[2] In 1565, a report on the coast of Thanet by the commissioners of Queen Elizabeth I stated that Birchington had 42 houses and did not have an active port.[5] Before the 19th century, the village coastline was frequented by smugglers, leading to skirmishes between them and excise officers. Several of the older houses in the village contain cellars and bricked up tunnels, once used for storing contraband.[2] 
 The 1801 census recorded the village's population as 537.[6] In the early 19th century, the Tudor Quex House had to be demolished and a replacement manor house was built in its place.[4] In 1818, the Waterloo Tower was built on the grounds of Quex Park. It is a bell tower built by the owner of Quex Park, John Powell Powell, who had an interest in change ringing. Waterloo Tower was the first twelve-bell tower in Kent.[7] The village was a farming community until the late 19th century, when it began to develop into a coastal resort. Birchington railway station was opened in 1863 and the Railway Hotel, now the Sea View Hotel pub, was opened in 1865. Station Road was subsequently built to serve as Birchington's main shopping street. Coast Guard cottages were built at Minnis Bay in the 1870s and the first shops appeared by the bay in 1903.[2] 
 [edit] Geography 
 Birchington-on-Sea is located at 51°22′37″N 1°18′18″E﻿ / ﻿51.37694°N 1.305°E﻿ / 51.37694; 1.305 (51.377, 1.305) in northeast Kent, on the coast of the Thames Estuary. The village is 14 kilometres (9 mi) to the east of Herne Bay and 6 kilometres (4 mi) to the west of Margate. The small town of Westgate-on-Sea lies between Birchington and Margate. The village/civil parish of Acol is 2 kilometres (1 mi) to the south and the villages/civil parishes of St Nicholas at Wade and Sarre are 5 kilometres (3 mi) to the southwest.[citation needed] 
 The village is built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is situated on the Isle of Thanet, which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between became silted up. The area to the west of the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the English Channel broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall.[8] The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.[9] 
 The drinking water in the village is classed as being 'very hard', having just over 120 mg of calcium per litre. The hardness is due to water being obtained from underground chalk sources by the water company Southern Water.[10] Waste water is discharged into the sea after being treated at a sewage works in Margate.[citation needed] 
 [edit] Climate 
 In East Kent, the warmest time of the year is July and August, when maximum temperatures average around 21 °C (70 °F). The coolest time of the year is January and February, when minimum temperatures average around 1 °C (34 °F).[11] East Kent's average maximum and minimum temperatures are around 1/2 °C higher than the national average.[12] East Kent's average annual rainfall is about 728 millimetres (29 in), with October to January being the wettest months.[11] The national average annual rainfall is about 838 millimetres (33 in).[12] 
 These are average temperature and rainfall figures taken between 1971 and 2000 at the Met Office weather station in Wye, around 24 miles (39 km) southwest of Birchington:

The beach has gained a European Blue Flag Award for its cleanliness and safety.[17] The village has three other smaller beaches, which are surrounded by chalk cliffs and cliff stacks. Wildlife that can be observed in the Thames Estuary includes seals, velvet swimming crabs and the migrant Turnstone.[18] 
 Paintings by local artists are displayed at the David Burley Gallery in Birchington Library.[19] Community activities take place at the Birchington Village Centre, including adult education classes, drama productions by the Birchington Guild of Players and concerts by the Birchington Silver Band. In 1989, Birchington-on-Sea was twinned with the town of La Chapelle d'Armentieres, near Lille in northern France;[20] Birchington Twinning Association arranges events between the two communities, such as school trips, concerts and war remembrance services.[21] Since 1932, Birchington has held a street carnival each summer.[22]

 [edit] Quex House and Park 
 To the south of the village is Quex House, a 200 year-old manor house situated in 250 acres (1.0 km2) of parkland and gardens. Several rooms, decorated with oriental and English period furniture, are open to visitors, and guided tours are provided.[36] The Powell-Cotton Museum houses three galleries of stuffed animal displays, depicting more than 500 African and Asian animals against their natural habitats.[37] Further galleries display a vast collection of African artefacts, European firearms, European and Asian cutting weapons, European and Chinese porcelain, and important archaeological finds from Thanet and East Kent.[38] The total amount of artefacts have not been counted, though the ethnography items alone total approximately 18,000.[39] 
 In 1896, Major Powell-Cotton founded the Powell-Cotton Museum at Quex Park to display his collection of mammals and artefacts acquired on his expeditions to Africa and Asia.[40] The animals were mounted by the noted taxidermist Rowland Ward.[41] Percy Horace Gordon Powell-Cotton was born in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers.[42] His expeditions were conducted for scientific research, and would sometimes take 18 months.[43] 
 During World War I, Quex House became an Auxiliary Military Hospital run by the Birchington Voluntary Aid Detachment.[44] In 1923, the Memorial Ground was donated to the village by Mr H. A. Erlebach for sport and recreational use. Mr Erlebach owned the village's now defunct Woodfood House School and purchased land from the Quex House estate for the school. He gave the southern part of the land to the people of Birchington and dedicated it in memory of his three sons who had been killed in World War I. The land is now owned by Thanet District Council.[45]
