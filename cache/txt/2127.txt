Beyoncé singles chronology
 "Irreplaceable" is a song recorded by American R&amp;B singer Beyoncé Knowles for her second studio album, B'Day (2006). The song was written by Knowles, Shaffer "Ne-Yo" Smith, Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund Bjørklund, and produced by Stargate and Knowles. "Irreplaceable" was originally a country record; it was re-arranged as a mid-tempo pop ballad with R&amp;B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Knowles' and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record that people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about female empowerment. 
 Following the moderate chart performances of "Déjà Vu" and "Ring the Alarm", "Irreplaceable" was released on December 5, 2006 in the United States as the album's third single, and the second single in other countries. The single was released through Columbia Records. "Irreplaceable" was well received by contemporary music critics, who cited its distinct production compared with most songs featured on the album, and complimented its hook, "To the left, to the left". Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. "Irreplaceable" won several awards including, Best R&amp;B/Soul Single at the 2007 Soul Train Music Award. It was nominated for the Record of the Year award at the 50th Grammy Awards. 
 The single was commercially successful worldwide. It became Knowles' fourth number-one in the US, was B'Day's most successful release, and remained at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for ten consecutive weeks. "Irreplaceable" was the best-selling US single of 2007, the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the US, and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It became Knowles' second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the US, the first being Mariah Carey in 2005. "Irreplaceable" peaked at number one in Australia, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top twenty in several European countries. As of 2007[update], "Irreplaceable" had sold more than 4.6 million digital copies worldwide.[1] 
 The single's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and served as the debut performance of Knowles' all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. "Irreplaceable" has regularly featured in Knowles' tours and live performances since 2006. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized the song as one of the most performed ones of 2007 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards. 
 [edit] Writing, recording and mixing 
 
 
 
 What happens sometimes, is you think about a specific artist and you put them in this box, the song has to be this way or that, and then you're usually confining yourself to the thing they did three years ago. 
 
 
 
 "Irreplaceable" was written for Chrisette Michele.[2][3] Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Knowles' second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said that they might not have gone in the direction they did on the song.[2] The tune did not suit Knowles' voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions.[2][4] When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country Western music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R&amp;B vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R&amp;B-country western music song instead.[4] 
 When the team worked with Ne-Yo, they recorded the song with a male vocalist. However, they thought a female vocalist would be more suitable,[2] and Ne-Yo also thought that it was empowering for a woman to sing it.[5] Eriksen of Stargate said it was an A&amp;R person who suggested that the song would work better when sung by a woman.[6] Two labels wanted the song.[6] While Knowles worked on material for B'Day, she was pleased with the demo of the "Irreplaceable" that was presented to her.[2] However, "Irreplaceable" did not seem to fit on B'Day, which was supposed to be "a hard-hitting club album ".[6]Swizz Beatz, who was working on the album, declared that Knowles would be "crazy" not to include the song on the record.[6] Knowles asked for changes to the song, including the addition of drums, vocal arrangements, and singing in a higher register than the demo.[2]Espen Lind and Amund Bjørklund, from the Norwegian production team Espionage, wrote the chord structure and the guitar part.[7] In an interview with MTV, Ne-Yo said, "Beyoncé had some stuff that she wanted to get off her chest",[8] while aiming to make a record that women could relate to, in keeping with the theme of the album.[9] 
 The recording was engineered by Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at Sony Music Studios in New York City.[7] Goldstein was hired to mix B'Day. He said: "This song was really simple to mix. It was produced by Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and there was lots of room for all the instruments".[10] Goldstein used a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the analogue flanger of a TC 1210 spatial expander "to sweeten the sound" and to give them "a little bit more spread".[10] Goldstein thought "Irreplaceable" sounded "a bit old-school", an eighth note delay echo was placed on the song's lead vocal at 341ms, using the Echo Farm plug-in software.[10] For the backing vocals, Goldstein used Echo Farm with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's Oxford Dynamics compressor/limiter in dual-mono mode.[10] 
 The compressor was placed in Classic setting, to emulate the LA-2A leveling amplifier, and the Warmth button used to add harmonics. Oxford Dynamics was used for the bass in a different setting. Goldstein passed the final mix through the Oxford EQ and Inflator plug-ins.[10]Pro Tools software was used to print the aux track into a 44.1kHz/24-bit CD and then into a 24-bit CD master.[10] After the sessions for "Irreplaceable" ended, Hermansen said that "everyone felt they had captured something special and that Beyoncé had done the track justice", but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play the song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal. "But then it became the biggest urban record ... ever," [Hermansen] said.[2] 
 [edit] Songwriting controversy 
 A controversy arose over the writing credits on "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: "Apparently Beyoncé was at a show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for my girls' and then the song came on ... The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement and that makes it a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is."[11] In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but thought that it would be better suited for Knowles, and later regretted giving the song to her.[12] Some of Knowles' fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her.[13] However, he clarified his comment later through Twitter, writing, "I said I originally wrote the song for me. ... Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's when I decided to give it away."[13] 
 [edit] Music, theme and lyrics 
 "Irreplaceable" is a mid-tempo pop ballad with R&amp;B influences.[14] Written in the key of B♭ major,[15] the beat is set in common time and moves at a moderate 88 beats per minute.[15] Knowles' vocal range in the song spans nearly two and a half octaves, from B♭2 to E♭5.[15] While most of the songs in the album are aggressive and uptempo, her voice on "Irreplaceable" is toned down.[16] "Irreplaceable" uses a gently strummed acoustic guitar,[17] following the B♭5-F5-Cm7-E♭6/9chord series.[15] Hermansen and Eriksen combined the classic chord progression on an acoustic guitar, a modern-sounding 808 drum beat and cellos.[2] Al Shipley of Stylus Magazine noted that the guitar strum can be found in Barbadian R&amp;B singer Rihanna's 2007 single "Hate That I Love You", a song co-produced by Stargate and Ne-Yo.[18] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote that a 2007 Stargate-produced single "With You", performed by American R&amp;B-pop singer Chris Brown, also features the same element.[19] He wrote, "'With You' is the convincer, even if you can instantly tell that producer Stargate was just trying to roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time."[19] while Billboard magazine wrote that it "leans a bit too heavily" to the song.[20] 
 Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that the female empowerment theme of "Irreplaceable" has similarities to that of Terry McMillan's 1995 novel Waiting to Exhale.[21] Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that "Irreplaceable" resembles ballads sung by Whitney Houston.[22] Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song was inspired by Aretha Franklin's work since "Irreplaceable" consists of several variations in gutturals and octave range.[16] The lyrics of "Irreplaceable" concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song "sounds a lot like a statement of independence".[17] Lamb noted the song has "strong lyrics with an unmistakable point about female resilience".[21] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote, "With a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance, Beyonce combines heartache, bravado, and anger as she tells a cad he's far from irreplaceable -- and that, in fact , her new man will be arriving momentarily."[23] Hermansen said that "Irreplaceable" is a song that "people from all walks of life can enjoy".[2] Knowles said that the song is "a little honest",[24] and, "... basically we can't forget our power and our worth. And sometimes you're so in love, you forget that. And sometimes you feel like you're not being appreciated. And sometimes they forget that they can be replaced."[24] 
 The song's lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form.[15] It begins with guitar strumming, and Knowles sings the hook-intro, "To the left, to the left"[25] three times in alternating bars,[26] and proceeds, "Everything you own in a box to the left".[17] In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, "You must not know 'bout me ... I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute ... Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Knowles recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Knowles sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus.[17] The Boston Globe noted that Knowles sings some parts of it in a higher register "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".[23] 
 [edit] Release 
 During the production of "Irreplaceable", Hermansen thought that the track would not receive radio play because of the acoustic guitars, and deemed the song too pop-oriented. Hermansen did not expect "Irreplaceable" to conform to any genre. Despite his prediction, the song became successful on urban charts. It was played in New York and on country radio stations. Shortly after the release of "Irreplaceable", Knowles told MTV: "I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs. I've had so many people come up to me in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't be strong enough to not call. I wouldn't know how much I'm worth.' I'm happy to be a part of that."[2] 
 In the US, "Irreplaceable" was the third single from B'Day', and followed "Ring the Alarm".[2] The single was released on December 5, 2006, and featured the album and instrumental versions of the track.[27] "Irreplaceable" was the second single released from B'Day in international markets on Columbia Records. Two versions of the single were released in the UK on October 26, 2006. A CD single, which featured the album version of "Irreplaceable", and the Freemasons club mix radio edit of "Ring the Alarm", was released. An enhanced CD, which included the album version, three remixes of "Ring the Alarm", and the "Ring the Alarm" music video, was also released.[28] A 12" single was released in the UK the following week.[28] In Australia, a maxi single, which featured the album version and two remixes of "Déjà Vu", was released on December 5, 2006.[29] A Maurice Joshua remix edit of the song was released in Australia two weeks later.[30] 
 Knowles recorded a Spanish version of the song called "Irreemplazable", and was included on the second disc of the deluxe edition of B'Day released on June 12, 2007.[31] An Irreemplazable EP was released in the US on August 28, 2007[32] and on September 10, 2007 in the UK.[33] The EP includes "Irreemplazable", the Norteña Remix of "Irreplaceable", "Amor Gitano", three versions of "Beautiful Liar", the Timbaland remix of "Get Me Bodied" featuring Voltio, and "Oye", the Spanish version of "Listen".[32][33] As a fundraiser for the 2011 earthquake in the Tōhoku region of Japan, a compilation album that included "Irreplaceable", called Songs for Japan, was released on March 25, 2011.[34] 
 [edit] Critical reception 
 [edit] Reviews 
 "Irreplaceable" was well received by critics for its guitar-driven melody and its hook, "To the left, to the left". Bill Lamb of About.com complimented Stargate for the simple, pop-oriented production, and wrote that listeners "will be singing the 'to the left' hook in [their] head for the rest of the day".[35] Lamb further described it as a "gorgeous, lightly swinging Stargate arrangement".[21] Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly noted "Irreplaceable" to be "a lilting tune unlike anything Beyoncé has ever performed".[36] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song is "gentle but maddeningly hook-y".[23] Spence Abbott of IGN wrote that "Irreplaceable" and "Resentment go for "a much more traditional contemporary R&amp;B vibe" than any of the previous tracks on B'Day, making them stand out as if they were recorded separately from the rest of the album.[16] 
 Roger Friedman of Fox News Channel wrote that "Irreplaceable" is a "clever ballad" and the most memorable track on B'Day. He added that it has the most potential of catching on with fans quickly, and that it is the only song on the album that "you might actually want to sing along to".[37] Mike Joseph of PopMatters commented that "'Irreplaceable' tellingly, was co-written by Ne-Yo, who may not be the powerhouse vocalist Beyonce is, but has significantly stronger songwriting skills. It's the best song on the album—perhaps Ms. Knowles should take a hint."[25] Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media, called "Irreplaceable" the best song on B'day and praised its overall production,[38] writing: 
 
Before, Beyoncé's approach to heartbreak was always literal, her voice and her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.[38]
 
 [edit] Recognition 
 Bill Lamb called "Irreplaceable" one of the strongest tracks on the album, and commended its subject matter of female strength and independence.[21] He ranked it at third place on his list of the Top 100 Pop Songs of 2006.[39] Lamb later ranked the song at number 19 on his list of the Top 100 Pop Songs of the 2000s, writing: "An element that makes Beyonce's 'Irreplaceable' resonate deeper after hearing it multiple times is that the subject matter of female strength and independence is at the core of her entire B'Day album that features the song. 'Irreplaceable' will remind many listeners of concepts central to Terry McMillan's Waiting to Exhale (1995) which remains a cultural touchstone over 15 years after its release."[40] Mark Edward Nero ranked it as the ninth best R&amp;B song of 2006, and wrote, "This song has modern-day classic written all over it."[41] Staff members of Pitchfork Media ranked the song on their list of The Top 100 Tracks of 2006 at number 45.[42] 
 In 2009, Ryan Schreiber ranked "Irreplaceable" at number 183 on his list of Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s (decade).[43] Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine wrote that "Irreplaceable" recaptured Knowles' debut single "Crazy in Love"'s near-perfection, describing it as "gentle but defiant", and further wrote, "Through some breezy strums and a sweet plaintive melody Beyonce delivers her most genuinely emotional vocal to date, equal parts vulnerable, upset, pissed off, vindictive, resigned, and apathetic&amp;."[44]Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 60 on its list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s.[45] 
 [edit] Accolades 
 "Irreplaceable" won the award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Female, at the 2007 Soul Train Music Award,[46] and the 'Favorite Song' award at the 2007 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.[47] It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in the 2008 Grammy Awards,[48] and Song of the Year at the VH1 Soul Vibe awards.[49] "Irreplaceable" was recognized as one of the five most-performed songs of 2007 by the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.[50] 
 [edit] Chart performance 
 "Irreplaceable" entered various charts worldwide, and became the most successful single released from B'Day. The single debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on November 4, 2006 at number eighty-seven.[51] It climbed the charts rapidly because of its radio airplay, and it was Greatest Airplay Gainer certification for six consecutive weeks in early December 2006.[52][53] Three weeks after the release of "Irreplaceable", B'Day re-entered the top ten on the US Billboard 200 chart.[2] The single reached number one on December 16, becoming Knowles' fourth number one single as a solo artist,[54] and her second in 2006, following "Check on It" (2005). The single spent ten consecutive weeks at number one[52] and was replaced by Nelly Furtado's "Say It Right" on February 24, 2007.[55] The feat was achieved after Kanye West's 2005 single, "Gold Digger" featuring Jamie Foxx, spent ten weeks at the top spot.[55] "Irreplaceable" outperformed "Baby Boy"'s nine-weeks at number one. Knowles' former group Destiny's Child's 2000 single "Independent Women Part I" remained at number one for eleven weeks late in 2000 and early in 2001.[55] "Irreplaceable" remained on the chart for thirty weeks,[56] and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of two million downloads,[57] It was additionally certified triple-platinum, denoting sales of three million master ringtones.[58] It has sold over 3,139,000 paid digital downloads in the US as of October 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[59] 
 According to Mediabase "Irreplaceable" passed the 200 million audience impressions mark on December 11, 2006.[60] Another single of Knowles, "Check on It" previously passed this mark on January 31, 2006.[60] Consequently, Knowles became the second singer to achieve this in the United States; the first being, Mariah Carey whose two singles, "We Belong Together" (2005) and "Shake It Off" (2005), passed the same audience impressions mark in 2005.[60] "Irreplaceable" stayed at number one on the US Hot 100 Airplay for eleven consecutive weeks,[61] and was the best-performing US single of 2007, topping the Billboard Top Hot 100 Hits.[62][63] "Irreplaceable" installed Knowles at third place for the most number one singles by a female song-writer, overtaking Janet Jackson and Carole King and tying Diane Warren for nine number-one singles. Knowles received three song-writing credits in one year, the only woman to achieve this since King in 1971 and Carey in 1991.[64] In February 2010, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed "Irreplaceable" as the highest certified master ringtone of the 2000s decade by a female solo artist.[65] By August 2011, the single had sold over three million digital downloads in the United States.[66] "Irreemplazable" charted equally well, peaking at number four on the Hot Latin Songs.[67] The EP appeared on the Latin Pop Albums at number two, Top Latin Albums at number three, Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums at number forty-one and on the Billboard 200 at number 105.[68][69] 
 "Irreplaceable" debuted at number-eight on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and peaked at number one for three consecutive weeks, becoming Knowles' first number one single in Australia.[56] It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipment of 70,000 copies.[70] "Irreplaceable" appeared twice on the ARIA year-end charts, reaching number twenty-three in 2006,[71] and number forty-two in 2007.[72] "Irreplaceable" debuted at number three on November 6, 2006, on the New Zealand Singles Chart, the song's highest entry on any chart. It peaked at number one, and remained on the chart for eighteen weeks.[56] It was later certified Platinum by the RIANZ.[73] "Irreplaceable" peaked within the top fifteen in several European singles charts.[56] It peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart, spending 12 weeks in the top 20 and 25 weeks on the chart. It was Knowles' fifth longest-charting single, and spent more weeks on the chart than her number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Déjà Vu" but slightly less than her recent hits "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", "Halo" and "Sweet Dreams". On the UK iTunes chart, "Irreplaceable" is currently Beyoncé's most downloaded non I Am... Sasha Fierce single and still ranks in the top 30 of R&amp;B/Soul songs.[74] Due to a performance of "Irreplaceable" at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival by Knowles on June 26, 2011, the song made a re-entry in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, entering at number thirty-three.[75][76] As of 2007[update], "Irreplaceable" had sold more them 4.6 million digital copies worldwide.[1] 
 [edit] Music video 
 "Irreplaceable" was directed by Anthony Mandler, who co-directed the video of "Get Me Bodied". The video features the debut performance of Knowles' all-female band, Suga Mama, who also appeared in the "Green Light" music video. Her acting-then-ex-boyfriend in the video is model Bobby Roache, who played police officer for the "Ring the Alarm" music video and warrior during Jay-Z and Knowles' live performance at the 2006 Fashion Rocks show.[77] The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable". Part of the video which shows Knowles dancing in silhouette in front of a glass door is inspired by a James Bond movie.[78] Late in January 2008, "Irreemplazable" premiered on the MiTRL, a video countdown show on the bilingual channel MTV Tr3s.[79] 
 The music video follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. "She told me to pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out — the video starts off like that", said Roache.[77] It opens with Knowles filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Knowles orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Knowles follows her then-ex boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the audience to find out that she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Knowles manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. Towards the end of the video, she sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama. It ends with Knowles greeting her new boyfriend at the front door. 
 At the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, Knowles won Video of the Year Award for "Irreplaceable", an award for which "Beautiful Liar" was also nominated.[80][81] It was nominated for Video of the Year during the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards,[82] but it lost to Rihanna's single, "Umbrella" (2007).[83] At the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards, the video was nominated for the Michael Jackson Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video, but lost to rapper (and husband) Jay-Z's "Show Me What You Got" video.[46][84] The video received two nominations for Best Female Artist and Video of the Year at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards.[85] 
 [edit] Live performances 
 Knowles performed in "Irreplaceable" during various public appearances. She opened the 2006 American Music Awards with a performance of "Irreplaceable", and wore a sparkly sequined minidress.[86] Knowles performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on September 5, 2006.[87] The song was a part of Knowles' set list for her The Beyoncé Experience and I Am... Tour tours.[88] "Irreplaceable" was the closing song during her 2007 The Beyoncé Experience world tour. It was performed late in the set on earlier tour dates, but when Knowles embarked on the US leg, it was performed earlier in the show.[89] On August 5, 2007, Knowles performed the song at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan.[90][91] Shaheem Reid of MTV wrote: " 'Irreplaceable' ended the night, but before the main attraction crooned one note, she told the audience that she sang two hours for them and it was time they sang for her. So the whole Garden sang the first verse of the record; 'To the left, to the left/ Everything you own in a box to the left/ In the closet, that's my stuff/ Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch.' Beyoncé herself officially closed out singing her own song though."[90] 
 In Los Angeles, Knowles performed "Irreplaceable" without backup dancers or live instrumentation.[89] As the audience sang, Knowles walked around the stage and pointed to audience members, shouted, "I see you!", and described their clothes or the signs they held. Then Knowles' sang the song herself.[89] When Knowles performed "Irreplaceable" in Sunrise, Florida on June 29, 2009, she wore a glittery gold leotard. As she sang, animated graphics of turntables, faders and other club equipment were projected behind the dancers and musicians.[92] Knowles was accompanied by two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three backup vocalists called the Mamas, and the lead guitarist, Bibi McGill.[93] Footage of Knowles' performance at the Staples Center, Los Angeles was included on The Beyoncé Experience Live! DVD (2007),[94] and the deluxe edition of I Am... World Tour (2010).[95] Knowles performed "Irreplaceable" at Palais Nikaïa in Nice, France, on June 20, 2011, where she wore a pink fringe dress,[96] and at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011.[75] According to NME, "'Irreplaceable' [at the Glastonbury Festival] sparked a mass singalong, with the crowd taking the lead on the entire first verse."[97] Following the performance of "Irreplaceable" at the Glastonbury Festival, the song was digitally released in the UK and the US on June 27, 2011 as charity single to raise funds for Oxfam, WaterAid and Greenpeace.[98][99] This version charted at number twenty-six on the UK Singles Chart and seven on the UK Indie Chart for the week ending July 9, 2011.[76] 
 In May, 2012, Knowles performed "Irreplaceable" during her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live revue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel.[100][101] She performed the song with a side-to-side stage competition in singing. According to Erika Ramirez of Billboard, she "smiled with gratitude" during the performance of the song.[102] 
 [edit] Usage in media 
 In May 2007, "Irreplaceable" was used in the final scene of "When the Chickens Come Home to Roost", the final episode of the first season of the television series The Game.[103] A group named Faith, consisting of Michelle Delamor, Ashley Rodriguez and Charity Vance, sang "Irreplaceable" on the 'group night' episode of ninth season of American Idol on February 10, 2010,[104] In 2011, Canadian singer Maria Aragon,[105] and South Korean singer G.NA, covered the song.[106]Andy Grammer performed "Irreplaceable" on the radio station The Mix Lounge 104.1 and posted the video of his performance on his YouTube page in June 2011.[107] 
 [edit] Cover versions 
 [edit] Sleigh Bells version 
 American band Sleigh Bells recorded an acoustic cover of the song during their Maida Vale sessions and released it Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on March 6, 2012.[108][109] A writer of Billboard magazine commented that their cover was "etheral".[109] Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly described the cover as "really good!... Krauss also has a teen-pop background thanks to her Rubyblue days, so it's actually not that surprising that she can find her away around a Top 40 single so well."[110] However, Maura Johnston of The Village Voice gave a negative review for the cover, saying: "Krauss sighs her way through the song, turning her voice into a mew that sounds like she was trying to sing along with the radio while not being heard by her roommates or anyone else outside of a six-inch radius...
