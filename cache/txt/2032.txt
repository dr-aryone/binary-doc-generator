  
 Tropical Storm Erick was the eighth tropical cyclone and fifth tropical storm of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. Erick originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa, traveled westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and emerged into the Eastern Pacific Ocean without any further development. The wave spawned a small low-pressure system on July 28, which matured into a tropical depression later that day despite strong wind shear in the region. The depression intensified into a tropical storm, and received the name "Erick" while continuing its westward track. However, the shear prevented the storm from intensifying further, and broke up the storm's structure within a few days. The cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and degenerated into a remnant low shortly after. Because the storm remained far out at sea, no damage was reported in association with Erick. 
 [edit] Meteorological history 
 In mid-July, a tropical wave exited the coast of Africa and traveled across the Atlantic basin. By July  27, the wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean, where it later spawned a low pressure area. Initially, wind shear prevented tropical cyclogenesis, leaving convection separated from the low. After some convective consolidation, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 31, while located 1,060 miles (1,700 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California.[1] Wind shear and dry air caused convection to remain concentrated on the western edge of the storm.[2] Based on Dvorak intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Erick at 0000 UTC on August 1.[3] Upon its upgrade, Erick attained peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1004 mbar (hPa; 29.66 inHg).[1] 
 The wind shear did not relent, and Erick remained disorganized, with a lack of banding features. As a result, the exact position of the center was difficult to locate. Erick tracked westward at around 10 mph (17 km/h) under the steering currents of a mid-level ridge to its north.[4] Later on August 1, the strong shear separated the center from the waning area of convection, indicating that the storm was deteriorating.[5] Erick weakened back to a tropical depression on August 2, only 24 hours after it became a tropical storm.[1] The low-level center became elongated and ill-defined;[6] Erick continued to weaken and degenerated back into a tropical wave on August 2, thousands of miles from land. A weak low reformed along the wave, although it did not reorganize into a tropical cyclone in the North Central Pacific.[1] On August 5, the low-level remnants of Erick passed south of Hawaii,[7] three days before fully dissipating.[1] 
 [edit] Impact 
 Because Erick remained "very far away from everywhere", no effects, property damage or fatalities were reported; no ships recorded tropical storm-force winds, and no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued.[1] Throughout its course, Erick posed a threat only to shipping lanes.[8]
