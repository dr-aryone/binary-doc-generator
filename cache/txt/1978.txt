  
 Hurricane Gert was a large tropical cyclone that caused significant flood damage throughout Central America and Mexico in September 1993. The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Gert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14. The following day, the cyclone briefly attained tropical storm strength before moving ashore in Nicaragua. It proceeded through Honduras and reorganized into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Honduras on September 17, though it weakened back to a depression upon entering Belize the next day. After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, Gert emerged over warm water in the Bay of Campeche, which allowed it to strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane on September 20. The hurricane made a final landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with peak sustained winds of 100 mph (165 km/h). The rugged terrain quickly disrupted its structure, and Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression near the state of Nayarit on September 21. There, it briefly redeveloped a few strong thunderstorms before dissipating over open water five days later. 
 Gert's broad wind circulation produced widespread and heavy rainfall across Central America, which, combined with saturated soil from Tropical Storm Bret's passage a month earlier, caused significant flooding of property and crops. Although the storm's highest winds occurred upon landfall in Mexico, the worst effects in the country were due to torrential rain. Following the overflow of several major rivers, deep flood waters submerged extensive parts of Veracruz and Tamaulipas and forced thousands to evacuate. The heaviest rainfall occurred further inland over the mountainous region of San Luis Potosí, where as much as 31.41 inches (798 mm) of precipitation were measured. In the wake of the disaster, the road networks across the affected countries were severely disrupted, and thousands of people became homeless. The storm caused at least 102 deaths and over $170 million (1993 USD) in damage. 
 [edit] Meteorological history 
 A tropical wave—an area of low pressure oriented north to south—moved off the African coast well south of Dakar on September 5, 1993, and tracked rapidly westward across the tropical Atlantic. Positioned at a relatively low latitude, the wave interacted with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which allowed for the enhancement of convection in its vicinity. It developed a weak low-pressure center at sea level, which passed directly over Trinidad on September 11. The majority of the system subsequently moved inland along the northern coast of South America, although it maintained its identity and emerged over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 13.[1] Owing to favorable tropospheric conditions aloft, the system began showing signs of development, as the deep convection organized into well-defined curved rainbands. Based on the increase in organization and the presence of a surface circulation, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on September 14, about 105 mi (165 km) north of the northern coast of Panama.[1][2] 
 The depression retained a large circulation during its formative stages, indicated by both satellite observations and data from rawinsondes in the region.[1] Its cloud pattern continued to coalesce, and the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Gert at 0900 UTC on September 15.[3] After tracking west-northwestward, the center of the storm moved ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, around 1800 UTC that day, with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).[1][4] An interaction with land impeded further development, and Gert weakened back to a tropical depression six hours later. Despite the center being inland for nearly two days, a large part of the circulation stayed over the adjacent Caribbean and Pacific waters. This allowed Gert to remain a tropical cyclone while trekking northwestward through Central America,[1] defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of dissipation over land.[5][6] 
 The cyclone moved into the Gulf of Honduras on September 17. It restrengthened into a tropical storm and turned to the north-northwest in response to a mid- to upper-level trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Gert's duration over water was short lived; the storm moved back inland near Belize City the next day, allowing minimal opportunity for additional strengthening. Once inland, Gert began to feel the effects of a ridge of high pressure and turned back to the west-northwest. After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula and decreasing in organization,[7] it entered the Bay of Campeche as a tropical depression late on September 18.[8] Gert restrengthened over open waters, as light wind shear allowed its deep convection to consolidate; by 0600 UTC the next day, the cyclone once again became a tropical storm.[9] On September 20, data from a United States Air Force aircraft indicated that the storm had become a hurricane with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Gert veered toward the west and slowed slightly owing to a shortwave trough to its north,[10] giving it more time to organize over water.[8] The cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale, with winds of 100 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg).[8] 
 Around 2100 UTC on September 20, Gert made a final landfall at peak intensity on the coast of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. Inland, the hurricane accelerated and rapidly weakened over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental; it had diminished to a tropical depression by September 21. Despite the degeneration, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E.[4][8] The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity, and satellite observations indicated the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September 22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level flow steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated on September 26.[11][12] 
 [edit] Preparations 
 After confirming the development of a tropical depression on September 14, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alert[nb 1] for coastal regions.[14] The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country.[15] National television and radio stations broadcast warning messages to alert the public, and emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This helped with the effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones.[14] A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September 15, extending south from Puerto Cabezas and including the adjacent islands.[15] In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival.[16] Once it became evident that the storm would strike the Yucatán Peninsula, coastal areas from Belize northward to Cozumel, Mexico were placed under a tropical storm warning on September 17 until Gert's landfall the next day.[4][15] 
 When Gert was still located over the peninsula, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for the Gulf Coast from the city of Veracruz northward to Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas. By September 18, it had been extended southward to Minatitlán and upgraded to a tropical storm warning, although the initial watch area was placed under a hurricane watch after Gert showed signs of strengthening. The next day, the watch for the area from Soto La Marina to Nautla was upgraded to hurricane warning as it became clearer where Gert would make landfall.[4][15] Prior to impact, several ports along the Gulf Coast halted their operations, and people living in risk zones were evacuated.[17] All warnings and watches were discontinued after the hurricane moved inland.[15] 
 [edit] Impact 
 Gert was a large tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan; it always remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. As a result, the storm produced a large area of heavy rainfall, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America through Mexico. The disaster resulted in 102 deaths, and damage to roads, crop, property, and vegetation surmounted $170 million.[nb 2] 
 [edit] Costa Rica 
 Although Gert's center remained off the coast of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1 in (332 mm) of rain during the passage of the storm.[18] Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consist of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and are therefore prone to soil saturation.[19] The initial rainfall caused a significant water rise in many rivers, which exacerbated the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted a wide-scale evacuation of residents from adjacent areas; however, the river crested gradually without major consequences. Following hours of prolonged downpours, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón and Osa experienced extensive flooding and localized landslides, inflicting heavy damage to roads and some bridges.[14] The floods destroyed about 500 acres (2.0 km2) of banana crop and caused moderate damage to oil palm plantations. Small-scale crop farmers of reed, maize, beans, and rice were also greatly affected. The storm disrupted local fishing, and several small boats in Quepos sustained damage.[20] High winds caused great destruction to the Manuel Antonio National Park, vastly impacting the tourism-driven economy in Quepos.[19] 
 Gert left moderate property damage in its wake; it demolished 27 homes and damaged 659, mostly because of flooding. In all, monetary losses surmounted $3.1 million, of which over $1.7 million was incurred by damage to the infrastructure.[21] Roughly 1,000 people sought shelter during the storm, but owing to the timely preparations in the country, only one cardiac arrest fatality was attributable to Gert when a landslide buried a home.[14][22] 
 [edit] Nicaragua 
 The storm moved ashore in Nicaragua a month after Tropical Storm Bret's passage through the country, causing excessive rainfall over already saturated areas.[23] In spite of striking the Atlantic coast, Gert produced the largest amounts of precipitation over northern and Pacific coastal areas. A maximum of 17.8 in (452 mm) fell at Corinto; other high totals include 17.6 in (447 mm) at Chinandega and 17.5 in (444 mm) at León. The capital of Managua recorded 9.8 in (249 mm) of rain during the event.[24] Sustained winds from the storm reached no more than 40 mph (65 km/h) upon landfall near Bluefields,[4] but they generated high waves of up to 12 ft (3.7 m) offshore. After weakening to a depression inland, Gert continued to produce moderate gales along its path through the country.[25] 
 Off the coast near Big Corn Island, rough surf and winds destroyed nine fishing boats. Two canoes with an unknown number of occupants disappeared at sea. Gert produced significant coastal flooding upon moving ashore near Bluefields and Tasbapauni, prompting about 1,000 residents and hundreds of indigenous Miskito villagers to evacuate.[25] Further inland, prolonged heavy rain caused numerous rivers to overflow, which in turn led to destructive freshwater flooding. A river near Rama rose to 32 ft (10 m) above its normal stage, leaving about 80 percent of the town submerged and displacing 3,900 people. Throughout the Boaco Department, similar flooding affected 6,000 residents.[26] Landslides caused additional damage to bridges and roads, disrupting local transportation.[23] At least 252 houses were destroyed, and more than 293 experienced damage across 14 of the country's departments.[23] In addition, Gert was responsible for considerable economic losses and damage to infrastructure.[26] It affected 10,408 households to varying degree, and there were 23 confirmed fatalities.[23][27] Since flood damage from Tropical Storm Bret occurred just a month prior, an exclusive damage total for Gert is unavailable. The two storms inflicted about $10.7 million in damage, primarily to private property.[28] 
 [edit] Honduras 
 Although it had weakened to a depression, Gert continued to drop significant amounts of rain while tracking across Honduras. In Tegucigalpa, at least 6.77 in (172 mm) of rain were recorded.[29] Destructive floods swept through 13 of the country's departments, including much of northern Honduras and the Mosquitia Region, which had already suffered losses from Tropical Storm Bret in the previous month. In the region, additional flooding from Gert affected 24,000 people and made communication with surrounding areas nearly impossible.[16] Elsewhere, the Ulúa River and several other major rivers overflowed because of excessive rains;[30] rivers across Sula Valley in particular sustained heavy damage to their banks, inundating much of San Pedro Sula—the country's second-largest city—and adjacent municipalities. The rising water prompted many residents to evacuate; the Ramón Villeda Morales International Airport halted all of its operations at the height of the flooding.[16] 
 The storm greatly devastated Puerto Cortés, one of the most important port cities in Central America.[31] Elsewhere in Cortés, the overflow of a river in Choloma triggered widespread floods;[30] landslides in that area alone claimed the lives of six people.[32] The country's agricultural sector sustained heavy flood damage to about 5,700 acres (23 km2) of plantations across low-lying areas, including banana, sugar, and citrus.[16][33] In all, Gert inflicted $10 million worth of damage to roads, bridges, and property.[29] The disaster directly affected 67,447 people, of which roughly 60 percent had to evacuate their homes. In its final public statement, the Government of Honduras confirmed 27 fatalities, though 12 missing persons remain unaccounted for.[16] 
 [edit] Elsewhere in Central America 
 While passing through Central America, Gert generated an increase in cloudiness and showers across El Salvador.[34] High winds uprooted trees or snapped their limbs, damaging power lines and causing power outages. In one community, downpours triggered damaging mudslides along a major highway.[27] The Río Grande de San Miguel rapidly crested as a result of the rain, causing an excess of water discharge just southwest of Usulután.[34] As a consequence, about 2,500 acres (10 km2) of crop from adjacent plantations sustained flood damage. Several other areas reported significant losses due to the flooding, including San Marcos and San Vicente; some property and road damage also occurred in San Miguel.[27] Although fishing operations were suspended at the height the storm, four fishermen disappeared at sea.[34] The weather system affected nearly 8,000 residents in the country;[27] officials reported twelve destroyed homes and five deaths in its wake.[34] 
 Torrential rains from Gert affected around 20,000 people and killed one girl in Guatemala. The storm caused considerable agricultural losses for the country, though there were no other specific reports of damage.[27] Gert moved ashore near Belize City as a minimal tropical storm, dropping heavy rainfall in Belize. Just offshore, a weather station on Hunting Caye recorded 9.5 in (241 mm) of precipitation during the event.[35] Despite the rain, only minor flooding occurred in Belize City.[36] 
 [edit] Mexico 
 While crossing the Yucatán Peninsula as a minimal storm, Gert dropped considerable rainfall in Quintana Roo; a 24-hour accumulation of 7.4 in (188 mm) was recorded at Chetumal, although much higher localized totals of around 15 in (380 mm) fell elsewhere in the state.[12][29] Gusty winds briefly buffeted the coast during the storm's landfall, with a maximum wind speed of 44 mph (70 km/h) recorded in Chetumal.[8] Damage was limited to localized floods, however, cutting off one road to traffic. In addition, the flooding forced the inhabitants of some low-lying areas in Chetumal and Felipe Carrillo Puerto to evacuate to higher ground.[37] Scattered showers caused light flooding in parts of the state of Campeche, such as Ciudad del Carmen.[38] 
 High gales and large waves battered wide stretches of coastline in Tamaulipas and Veracruz upon Gert's landfall, although hurricane-force winds were largely confined to areas within the cyclone's southern eyewall.[29][39] Tuxpan, just south of where the eye moved ashore,[8] recorded wind velocities of over 100 mph (160 km/h), while 80 mph (130 km/h) gusts occurred further south in Poza Rica. To the north, winds reached 55 mph (90 km/h) in Tampico, Tamaulipas. Despite the severity of the winds, the worst of Gert was due to orographic lift when its broad circulation made contact with the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental highlands.[29] This caused extreme precipitation over large parts of the Huasteca Region, with 31.41 in (798 mm) of rain recorded in Aquismón, San Luis Potosí.[12] In addition, Tempoal in Veracruz recorded a maximum 24-hour total of 13.35 in (339 mm).[29] 
 The first reports of impact were from high winds, which uprooted trees and ripped off the roofs of homes in Tuxpan, Naranjos, Cerro Azul, and Poza Rica.[40] Following Gert's extreme rains, catastrophic flooding struck many northeastern regions. The Pánuco River, which rose to its highest level in 40 years, and the Palma Sola River burst their banks and overflowed, forcing thousands of people out of their homes.[41][42] Continued heavy rain in the wake of the storm aggravated the situation; the flooding ultimately submerged about 2,000,000 acres (8,100 km2) of land around Pánuco and Tampico. Deep waters and thick mud inundated half of Tampico, demolishing structures and roads and forcing 200,000 residents to evacuate.[43] Urban areas of Madero and Altamira were also hit hard by the flooding.[44] The Pánuco River basin sustained massive damage to its crops (mainly coffee, corn, bean, and soy), which increased as the flooding persisted in the following weeks.[43] The agricultural sector in San Luis Potosí also suffered great losses after roughly 80 percent of the crop and large amounts of livestock were washed away. Water damage to schools, bridges, and roads was particularly widespread, and 25 people lost their lives in the state.[45] 
 Gert's trail of devastation extended as far inland as Hidalgo, where 35 rivers burst their banks. The flooding washed away bridges and roads, isolating 361 communities. The hurricane disrupted the state's power, telephone, and water services, increasing the lack of communication. Structural damage across the state was fairly significant; at least 4,425 homes, 121 schools, and 49 public buildings were affected. Fifteen deaths occurred in the state alone, and eight people suffered injuries.[45] In all, Gert became the worst natural disaster to strike the region in 40 years,[46] with 29,075 houses and 145,000 acres (590 km2) of crop damaged or destroyed across Mexico. The associated monetary losses totaled $156 million, and the death toll stood at 45.[29][43] 
 [edit] Aftermath 
 [edit] Central America 
 Because of Gert's effects, the Government of Costa Rica declared a national emergency for the country on September 16, 1993.[19] Emergency crews were dispatched to assess damage and distribute life supplies to the affected population; this included 90,940 lbs (41,250 kg) of food, 1,422 mattresses, and 1,350 blankets.[14] In its wake, the disrupted road network across the affected regions impacted the local agriculture, tourism, and commerce.[20] The obstruction of the major Pan-American Highway, which connects the central region to the south of the country, resulted in considerable economic losses. Following the extensive flood damage to farmland, many independent crop producers suffered from being unable to partake in subsequent sowings.[20] 
 Before the arrival of Gert, a state of emergency was in effect for Nicaragua as a result of Tropical Storm Bret. National and regional relief agencies, including the Red Cross, accordingly extended their relief efforts. Although the government did not re-appeal for international assistance, several monetary contributions were made by overseas organizations; a transfer channel for cash donations was opened at the Swiss Bank Corporation. The United Nations Development Programme provided $50,000 for the local purchase of fuel, and UNICEF distributed $25,000 worth of household supplies and medicine. The World Food Programme donated approximately 160,000 lbs (72 tonnes) of food supply and offered services of expert in response to the disaster. The federal governments of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, and Spain donated a combined $300,000 in aid.[23] 
 On September 18, the President of Honduras surveyed the affected regions by helicopter. A local emergency was declared for various municipalities two days later. Although most of the affected population received aid within days, the limited road network caused a large delay in relief efforts to the hard-hit Mosquitia Region. By September 28, about 27,000 residents unable to reenter their flooded homes remained in government-owned shelters. Seven weeks later, a temporary housing project was implemented for the 120 families most in need. Countrywide, sewage systems, water works, and latrines were severely disrupted and in need of rehabilitation. Public health concerns rose in the wake of Gert; the cost of required medicines totaled $208,000. The governments of Japan, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom provided a combined $310,300 for the purchase of relief items. Because of the storm damage, approximately 5,900 families lost their source of income.[16] Following the destruction of its sole water reservoir, much of Puerto Cortés suffered potable water shortages for months in Gert's wake.[31] The storm exacerbated a cholera outbreak in rural areas due to contaminated water supplies.[47] 
 [edit] Mexico 
 In response to the flood disaster, Red Cross officials immediately began distributing aid to victims. After the President of Mexico assessed the situation by helicopter, the Pánuco River basin was declared an emergency zone,[43] and ground and air-sea search and rescue missions were activated.[44] Many homes sustained irreparable damage to their roofs, leaving thousands of residents homeless. The government appealed for international aid, seeking nutritional and medical supplies, as well as weather-permitting clothing.[43] Five storage centers across Hidalgo provided over 93 million lbs (42,000 tonnes) of food supply; 142,000 lbs (64 tonnes) of chicken, 45,000 pantries, and 76,000 disposable plates were distributed across San Luis Potosí, as well as 50,440 blankets and 6,081 airbeds. Several schools served as shelters for the homeless.[45] Sheltered children, elderly, and pregnant or lactating women received milk powder donations, costing $27,000.[43] 
 By three weeks after the storm, over 65,000 people had been accommodated in shelters; most of them remained as such until flood water levels receded weeks later. A grant of $22,000 was made available to purchase roofing sheets for those in urgent need of home repair. The president assigned $37.4 million for the reconstruction of roads and housing, as well as the assistance of affected farmers. In Gert's wake, the amount of respiratory disease and skin infection cases rose slightly, although the overall health situation for the country remained well under control.[43]
