T*(Indian filmmaker. He is regarded as one of the few great masters of world )Tj
T*(cinema. Ray was born in the city of Calcutta into a Bengali family prominent in )Tj
T*(the world of arts and literature. Starting his career as a commercial artist, )Tj
T*(Ray was drawn into independent filmmaking after meeting French filmmaker Jean )Tj
T*(Renoir and viewing Vittorio De Sica's Italian neorealist 1948 film Bicycle )Tj
T*(Thieves during a visit to London. )Tj
T*( Ray directed 36 films, including feature films, documentaries and shorts. He )Tj
T*(was also a fiction writer, publisher, illustrator, calligrapher, graphic )Tj
T*(designer and film critic. He authored several short stories and novels, )Tj
T*(primarily aimed at children and adolescent. Feluda, the sleuth, and Professor )Tj
T*(Shonku, the scientist in his science fictions, are popular fictional characters )Tj
T*(created by him. )Tj
T*( Ray's first film, Pather Panchali \(1955\), won eleven international prizes, )Tj
T*(including Best Human Documentary at the Cannes Film Festival. This film, )Tj
T*(Aparajito \(1956\) and Apur Sansar \(1959\) form The Apu Trilogy. Ray did the )Tj
T*(scripting, casting, scoring, and editing, and designed his own credit titles )Tj
T*(and publicity material. Ray received many major awards in his career, including )Tj
T*(32 Indian National Film Awards, a number of awards at international film )Tj
T*(festivals and award ceremonies, and an Academy Award in 1992. The Government of )Tj
T*(India honoured him with the Bharat Ratna in 1992. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life and background )Tj
T*( Satyajit Ray's ancestry can be traced back for at least ten generations.[9] )Tj
T*(Ray's grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray was a writer, illustrator, philosopher, )Tj
T*(publisher, amateur astronomer and a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, a religious and )Tj
T*(social movement in nineteenth century Bengal. He also set up a printing press )Tj
T*(by the name of U. Ray and Sons, which formed a crucial backdrop to Satyajit's )Tj
T*(life. Sukumar Ray, Upendrakishore's son and father of Satyajit, was a )Tj
T*(pioneering Bengali writer of nonsense rhyme and children's literature, an )Tj
T*(illustrator and a critic. Ray was born to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta. )Tj
T*( Sukumar Ray died when Satyajit was barely three, and the family survived on )Tj
T*(Suprabha Ray's meager income. Ray studied at Ballygunge Government High School, )Tj
T*(Calcutta, and completed his B.A. \(Hons.\) in economics at Presidency College of )Tj
T*(the University of Calcutta, though his interest was always in fine arts. In )Tj
T*(1940, his mother insisted that he study at the Visva-Bharati University at )Tj
T*(Santiniketan, founded by Rabindranath Tagore. Ray was reluctant due to his love )Tj
T*(of Calcutta, and the low opinion of the intellectual life at Santiniketan[10] )Tj
T*(His mother's persuasion and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to )Tj
T*(try. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate Oriental art. He later admitted )Tj
T*(that he learned much from the famous painters Nandalal Bose[11] and Benode )Tj
T*(Behari Mukherjee. Later he produced a documentary film, The Inner Eye, about )Tj
T*(Mukherjee. His visits to Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta stimulated his admiration )Tj
T*(for Indian art.[12] )Tj
T*( In 1943, Ray started work at D.J. Keymer, a British-run advertising agency, as )Tj
T*(a "junior visualiser," earning eighty rupees a month. Although he liked visual )Tj
T*(design \(graphic design\) and he was mostly treated well, there was tension )Tj
T*(between the British and Indian employees of the firm. The British were better )Tj
T*(paid, and Ray felt that "the clients were generally stupid."[13] Later, Ray )Tj
T*(also worked for Signet Press, a new publishing house started by D. K. Gupta. )Tj
T*(Gupta asked Ray to create cover designs for books to be published by Signet )Tj
T*(Press and gave him complete artistic freedom. Ray designed covers for many )Tj
T*(books, including Jibanananda Das's Banalata Sen, and Rupasi Bangla, Jim )Tj
T*(Corbett's Maneaters of Kumaon, and Jawaharlal Nehru's Discovery of India. He )Tj
T*(worked on a children's version of Pather Panchali, a classic Bengali novel by )Tj
T*(Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, renamed as Aam Antir Bhepu \(The mango-seed )Tj
T*(whistle\). Designing the cover and illustrating the book, Ray was deeply )Tj
T*(influenced by the work. He used it as the subject of his first film, and )Tj
T*(featured his illustrations as shots in his groundbreaking film.[14] )Tj

T*(Society in 1947. They screened many foreign films, many of which Ray watched )Tj
T*(and seriously studied. He befriended the American GIs stationed in Calcutta )Tj
T*(during World War II, who kept him informed about the latest American films )Tj
T*(showing in the city. He came to know a RAF employee, Norman Clare, who shared )Tj
T*(Ray's passion for films, chess and western classical music.[15] )Tj
T*( In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, his first cousin and longtime sweetheart.[16] )Tj
T*(The couple had a son, Sandip, who is now a film director. In the same year, )Tj
T*(French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray )Tj
T*(helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea )Tj
T*(of filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir )Tj
T*(encouraged him in the project.[17] In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to )Tj
T*(work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched )Tj
T*(99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette \(Bicycle )Tj
T*(Thief\) \(1948\) by Vittorio De Sica, which had a profound impact on him. Ray )Tj
T*(later said that he came out of the theater determined to become a )Tj
T*(film-maker.[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] The Apu Years \(1950‚Äì59\) )Tj
T*( Ray decided to use Pather Panchali \(1928\), the classic bildungsroman of )Tj
T*(Bengali literature, as the basis for his first film. The semi-autobiographical )Tj
T*(novel describes the maturation of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal village. )Tj
T*( Ray gathered an inexperienced crew, although both his cameraman Subrata Mitra )Tj
T*(and art director Bansi Chandragupta went on to achieve great acclaim. The cast )Tj
T*(consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his )Tj
T*(personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, )Tj
T*(but did not succeed on his terms.[19] As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali )Tj
T*(over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production )Tj
T*(manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds.[19] He refused funding )Tj
T*(from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He )Tj
T*(also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he )Tj
T*(did receive funding that allowed him to complete the film.[20] Ray showed an )Tj
T*(early film passage to Anglo-Irish director John Huston, who was in India )Tj
T*(scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King. The passage was of the vision )Tj
T*(which Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside, the )Tj
T*(only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified )Tj
T*(Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art \(MOMA\) that a major talent )Tj
T*(was on the horizon. )Tj
T*( With a loan from the West Bengal government, Ray finally completed the film. )Tj
T*(It was released in 1955 to great critical and popular success. It earned )Tj
T*(numerous prizes and had long runs in both India and abroad. In India, the )Tj
T*(reaction to the film was enthusiastic; The Times of India wrote that "It is )Tj
T*(absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...] Pather Panchali is pure )Tj
T*(cinema."[21] In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of )Tj
T*(the film.[21] But, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the )Tj
T*(movie, Fran√ßois Truffaut is reported to have said, "I don‚Äôt want to see a movie )Tj
T*(of peasants eating with their hands."[22]Bosley Crowther, then the most )Tj
T*(influential critic of The New York Times, wrote a scathing review of the film. )Tj
T*(Its American distributor Ed Harrison was worried Crowther's review would )Tj
T*(dissuade audiences, but the film had an exceptionally long run when released in )Tj
T*(the United States. )Tj
T*( Ray's international career started in earnest after the success of his next )Tj
T*(film, Aparajito \(The Unvanquished\).[23] This film shows the eternal struggle )Tj
T*(between the ambitions of a young man, Apu, and the mother who loves him.[23] )Tj
T*(Critics such as Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak rank it higher than Ray's first )Tj
T*(film.[23]Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, bringing )Tj
T*(Ray considerable acclaim. Before completing The Apu Trilogy, Ray directed and )Tj
T*(released two other films: the comic Parash Pathar \(The Philosopher's Stone\), )Tj
T*(and Jalsaghar \(The Music Room\), a film about the decadence of the Zamindars, )Tj
T*(considered one of his most important works.[24] )Tj
T*( While making Aparajito, Ray had not planned a trilogy, but after he was asked )Tj

T*(trilogy, Apur Sansar \(The World of Apu\) in 1959. Critics Robin Wood and Aparna )Tj
T*(Sen found this to be the supreme achievement of the trilogy. Ray introduced two )Tj
T*(of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. )Tj
T*(It opens with Apu living in a Calcutta house in near-poverty. He becomes )Tj
T*(involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna. The scenes of their life together )Tj
T*(form "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depictions of married life."[26] )Tj
T*(They suffer tragedy. After Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali )Tj
T*(critic, Ray wrote an article defending it. He rarely responded to critics )Tj
T*(during his filmmaking career, but also later defended his film Charulata, his )Tj
T*(personal favourite.[27] )Tj
T*( Ray's film successes had little influence on his personal life in the years to )Tj
T*(come. He continued to live with his wife and children in a rented house, with )Tj
T*(his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family.[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] From Devi to Charulata \(1959‚Äì64\) )Tj
T*( During this period, Ray composed films on the British Raj period \(such as )Tj
T*(Devi\), a documentary on Tagore, a comic film \(Mahapurush\) and his first film )Tj
T*(from an original screenplay \(Kanchenjungha\). He also made a series of films )Tj
T*(that, taken together, are considered by critics among the most deeply felt )Tj
T*(portrayals of Indian women on screen.[29] )Tj
T*( Ray followed Apur Sansar with Devi \(The Goddess\), a film in which he examined )Tj
T*(the superstitions in the Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a )Tj
T*(young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the censor )Tj
T*(board might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but Devi was )Tj
T*(spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was )Tj
T*(commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore, on the occasion of )Tj
T*(the poet's birth centennial, a tribute to the person who likely most influenced )Tj
T*(Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray faced the challenge of making a film )Tj
T*(out of mainly static material. He said that it took as much work as three )Tj
T*(feature films.[30] )Tj
T*( In the same year, together with Subhas Mukhopadhyay and others, Ray was able )Tj
T*(to revive Sandesh, the children's magazine which his grandfather once )Tj
T*(published. Ray had been saving money for some years to make this possible.[31] )Tj
T*(A duality in the name \(Sandesh means both "news" in Bengali and also a sweet )Tj
T*(popular dessert\) set the tone of the magazine \(both educational and )Tj
T*(entertaining\). Ray began to make illustrations for it, as well as to write )Tj
T*(stories and essays for children. Writing became his major source of income in )Tj
T*(the years to come. )Tj
T*( In 1962, Ray directed Kanchenjungha. Based on his first original screenplay, )Tj
T*(it was his first film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family )Tj
T*(spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. )Tj
T*(They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid )Tj
T*(engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a )Tj
T*(large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used )Tj
T*(the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray )Tj
T*(noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting )Tj
T*(conditions, a commercial film contingent present at the same time in Darjeeling )Tj
T*(failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.[32] )Tj
T*( In the sixties, Ray visited Japan and took particular pleasure in meeting the )Tj
T*(filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, for whom he had very high regard. While at home, he )Tj
T*(would take an occasional break from the hectic city life by going to places )Tj
T*(such as Darjeeling or Puri to complete a script in isolation. )Tj
T*( In 1964 Ray made Charulata \(The Lonely Wife\); it was the culmination of this )Tj
T*(period of work, and regarded by many critics as his most accomplished film.[33] )Tj
T*(Based on "Nastanirh", a short story of Tagore, the film tells of a lonely wife, )Tj
T*(Charu, in 19th-century Bengal, and her growing feelings for her brother-in-law )Tj
T*(Amal. Critics have referred to this as Ray's Mozartian masterpiece. He said the )Tj
T*(film contained the least flaws among his work, and it was his only work which, )Tj
T*(given a chance, he would make exactly the same way.[34]Madhabi Mukherjee's )Tj
T*(performance as Charu, and the work of both Subrata Mitra and Bansi Chandragupta )Tj
T*(in the film, have been highly praised. Other films in this period include )Tj

T*( [edit] New directions \(1965‚Äì82\) )Tj
T*( In the post-Charulata period, Ray took on projects of increasing variety, )Tj
T*(ranging from fantasy to science fiction to detective films to historical drama. )Tj
T*(Ray also made considerable formal experimentation during this period. He )Tj
T*(expressed contemporary issues of Indian life, responding to a perceived lack of )Tj
T*(these issues in his films. The first major film in this period is Nayak \(The )Tj
T*(Hero\), the story of a screen hero traveling in a train and meeting a young, )Tj
T*(sympathetic female journalist. Starring Uttam Kumar and Sharmila Tagore, in the )Tj
T*(twenty-four hours of the journey, the film explores the inner conflict of the )Tj
T*(apparently highly successful matin√©e idol. In spite of the film's receiving a )Tj
T*("Critics prize" at the Berlin Festival, it had a generally muted reception.[35] )Tj
T*( In 1967, Ray wrote a script for a film to be called The Alien, based on his )Tj
T*(short story "Bankubabur Bandhu" \("Banku Babu's Friend"\) which he wrote in 1962 )Tj
T*(for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. Columbia Pictures was the producer for )Tj
T*(what was a planned U.S.-India co-production, and Peter Sellers and Marlon )Tj
T*(Brando were cast as the leading actors. Ray found that his script had been )Tj
T*(copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Mike Wilson. Wilson had initially )Tj
T*(approached Ray through their mutual friend, Arthur C. Clarke, to represent him )Tj
T*(in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the script credited to Mike Wilson &amp; )Tj
T*(Satyajit Ray, although he contributed only one word. Ray later said that he )Tj
T*(never received a penny for the script.[36] After Brando dropped out of the )Tj
T*(project, the project tried to replace him with James Coburn, but Ray became )Tj
T*(disillusioned and returned to Calcutta.[36][37] Columbia expressed interest in )Tj
T*(reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but nothing came of )Tj
T*(it. When E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film )Tj
T*(to his earlier Alien script. In a 1980 Sight &amp; Sound feature, Ray had )Tj
T*(discussed the collapse of his American co-project. His biographer Andrew )Tj
T*(Robinson provided more details in The Inner Eye \(1989\). Ray believed that )Tj
T*(Spielberg's film would not have been possible without copies of his script of )Tj
T*(The Alien having been available in the United States. Spielberg has denied this )Tj
T*(charge.[38] Besides The Alien, two other unrealized projects which Ray had )Tj
T*(intended to direct were adaptations of the ancient Indian epic, the )Tj
T*(MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, and E. M. Forster's 1924 novel A Passage to India.[39] )Tj
T*( In 1969, Ray released what would be commercially the most successful of his )Tj
T*(films. Based on a children's story written by his grandfather, Goopy Gyne Bagha )Tj
T*(Byne \(The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha\), it is a musical fantasy. Goopy the )Tj
T*(singer and Bagha the drummer, equipped by three gifts allowed by the King of )Tj
T*(Ghosts, set out on a fantastic journey. They try to stop an impending war )Tj
T*(between two neighbouring kingdoms. Among his most expensive enterprises, the )Tj
T*(film project was difficult to finance. Ray abandoned his desire to shoot it in )Tj
T*(colour, as he turned down an offer that would have forced him to cast a certain )Tj
T*(Bollywood actor as the lead.[40] )Tj
T*( Ray made a film from a novel by the young poet and writer, Sunil Gangopadhyay. )Tj
T*(Featuring a musical motif structure acclaimed as more complex than )Tj
T*(Charulata,[41]Aranyer Din Ratri \(Days and Nights in the Forest\) traces four )Tj

T*(women, which becomes a deep study of the Indian middle class. According to )Tj
T*(Robin Wood, "a single sequence [of the film] ... would offer material for a )Tj

T*( [edit] The last phase \(1983‚Äì92\) )Tj
T*( In 1983, while working on Ghare Baire \(Home and the World\), Ray suffered a )Tj
T*(heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years )Tj
T*(of his life. Ghare Baire was completed in 1984 with the help of Ray's son \(who )Tj
T*(operated the camera from then on\) because of his health condition. He had )Tj
T*(wanted to film this Tagore novel on the dangers of fervent nationalism for a )Tj
T*(long time, and wrote a first draft of a script for it in the 1940s.[47] In )Tj
T*(spite of rough patches due to Ray's illness, the film did receive some critical )Tj
T*(acclaim. It had the first kiss fully portrayed in Ray's films. In 1987, he made )Tj
T*(a documentary on his father, Sukumar Ray. )Tj
T*( Ray's last three films, made after his recovery and with medical strictures in )Tj
T*(place, were shot mostly indoors, and have a distinctive style. They have more )Tj
T*(dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his )Tj
T*(earlier body of work.[48] The first, Ganashatru \(An Enemy of the People\) is an )Tj
T*(adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the )Tj
T*(three.[49] Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha )Tj
T*(\(Branches of the Tree\).[50] In it, an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, )Tj
T*(comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows )Tj
T*(the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is )Tj
T*(uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk \(The Stranger\), is )Tj
T*(lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his )Tj
T*(niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes )Tj
T*(far-ranging questions in the film about civilization.[51] )Tj
T*( In 1992, Ray's health deteriorated due to heart complications. He was admitted )Tj
T*(to a hospital, and would never recover. An honorary Oscar was awarded to him )Tj
T*(weeks before his death, which he received in a gravely ill condition. He died )Tj
T*(on 23 April 1992 at the age of 70. )Tj
T*( [edit] Film craft )Tj
T*( Satyajit Ray considered script-writing to be an integral part of direction. )Tj
T*(Initially he refused to make a film in any language other than Bengali. In his )Tj

T*(the early films was so important that Ray would always write scripts in English )Tj
T*(before creating a Bengali version, so that the non-Bengali Chandragupta would )Tj
T*(be able to read it. The craft of Subrata Mitra garnered praise for the )Tj
T*(cinematography of Ray's films. A number of critics thought that his departure )Tj
T*(from Ray's crew lowered the quality of cinematography in the following )Tj
T*(films.[35] Though Ray openly praised Mitra, his single-mindedness in taking )Tj
T*(over operation of the camera after Charulata caused Mitra to stop working for )Tj
T*(him after 1966. Mitra developed "bounce lighting", a technique to reflect light )Tj
T*(from cloth to create a diffused, realistic light even on a set. Ray )Tj
T*(acknowledged his debts to Jean-Luc Godard and Fran√ßois Truffaut of the French )Tj
T*(New Wave for introducing new technical and cinematic innovations.[52] )Tj
T*( Ray's regular editor was Dulal Datta, but the director usually dictated the )Tj
T*(editing while Datta did the actual work. Because of financial reasons and Ray's )Tj
T*(meticulous planning, his films were mostly cut "on the camera" \(apart from )Tj
T*(Pather Panchali\). At the beginning of his career, Ray worked with Indian )Tj
T*(classical musicians, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan and Ali Akbar Khan. )Tj
T*(He found that their first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his )Tj
T*(film. He had a greater understanding of western classical forms, which he )Tj
T*(wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu.[53] Starting with Teen )Tj
T*(Kanya, Ray began to compose his own scores. )Tj
T*( He used actors of diverse backgrounds, from famous film stars to people who )Tj
T*(had never seen a film \(as in Aparajito\).[54]Robin Wood and others have lauded )Tj
T*(him as the best director of children, pointing out memorable performances in )Tj
T*(the roles of Apu and Durga \(Pather Panchali\), Ratan \(Postmaster\) and Mukul )Tj
T*(\(Sonar Kella\). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied )Tj
T*(the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as )Tj
T*(Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as "a puppet"[55] \(Subir Banerjee as young Apu )Tj
T*(or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna\). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his )Tj
T*(customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with "total )Tj
T*(contempt".[56] )Tj
T*( [edit] Literary works )Tj
T*( Ray created two popular fictional characters in Bengali children's )Tj
T*(literature‚ÄîFeluda, a sleuth, and Professor Shonku, a scientist. The Feluda )Tj
T*(stories are narrated by Topshe, his cousin, something of a Watson to Feluda's )Tj
T*(Holmes. The science fictions of Shonku are presented as a diary discovered )Tj
T*(after the scientist had mysteriously disappeared. Ray also wrote a collection )Tj
T*(of nonsense verse named Today Bandha Ghorar Dim, which includes a translation )Tj
T*(of Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky". He wrote a collection of humorous stories of )Tj
T*(Mullah Nasiruddin in Bengali. )Tj
T*( His short stories were published as collections of 12 stories, in which the )Tj
T*(overall title played with the word twelve \(for example Aker pitthe dui, or )Tj
T*(literally "Two on top of one"\). Ray's interest in puzzles and puns is reflected )Tj
T*(in his stories. Ray's short stories give full rein to his interest in the )Tj
T*(macabre, in suspense and other aspects that he avoided in film, making for an )Tj
T*(interesting psychological study.[57] Most of his writings have been translated )Tj
T*(into English. Most of his screenplays have been published in Bengali in the )Tj
T*(literary journal Eksan. Ray wrote an autobiography about his childhood years, )Tj
T*(Jakhan Choto Chilam \(1982\). )Tj
T*( He also wrote essays on film, published as the collections: Our Films, Their )Tj
T*(Films \(1976\), Bishoy Chalachchitra \(1976\), and Ekei Bole Shooting \(1979\). )Tj
T*(During the mid-1990s, Ray's film essays and an anthology of short stories were )Tj
T*(also published in English in the West. Our Films, Their Films is an anthology )Tj
T*(of film criticism by Ray. The book contains articles and personal journal )Tj
T*(excerpts. The book is presented in two sections: Ray first discusses Indian )Tj
T*(film, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers )Tj
T*(\(Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa\), and movements such as Italian neorealism. )Tj
T*(His book Bishoy Chalachchitra was published in translation in 2006 as Speaking )Tj

T*(Bizarre, Daphnis, and Holiday Script, apart from numerous Bengali ones for the )Tj
T*(Sandesh magazine.[58][59] Ray Roman and Ray Bizarre won an international )Tj
T*(competition in 1971.[60] In certain circles of Calcutta, Ray continued to be )Tj
T*(known as an eminent graphic designer, well into his film career. Ray )Tj
T*(illustrated all his books and designed covers for them, as well as creating all )Tj
T*(publicity material for his films, i.e., Ray‚Äôs artistic playing with the Bangla )Tj
T*(graphemes was also revealed in the cine posters and cine promo-brochures‚Äô )Tj
T*(covers. He also designed covers of several books by other authors.[61] In his )Tj
T*(calligraphic technique there are deep impacts of: \(a\) Artistic pattern of )Tj
T*(European musical staff notation in the graphemic syntagms; \(b\) alpana \(‚Äúritual )Tj
T*(painting‚Äù mainly practiced by Bengali women at the time of religious festival; )Tj
T*(the term denotes 'to coat with‚Äô. Generally categorized as ‚ÄúFolk‚Äù-Art cf. in )Tj
T*(Ray‚Äôs graphemic representations. )Tj
T*( Thus, so-called division between classical and folk art is blurred in Ray‚Äôs )Tj
T*(representation of Bangla graphemes. The three-tier X-height of Bangla graphemes )Tj
T*(was presented in a manner of musical map and the contours, curves in between )Tj

T*(also noticed that the metamorphosis of graphemes \(This might be designated as )Tj
T*(‚ÄúArchewriting‚Äù\) as a living object/subject in Ray‚Äôs positive manipulation of )Tj
T*(Bangla graphemes.[62] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical and popular response )Tj
T*( Ray's work has been described as full of humanism and universality, and of a )Tj
T*(deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity.[63][64] The Japanese )Tj
T*(director Akira Kurosawa said, "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means )Tj
T*(existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon."[65] But his )Tj
T*(detractors find his films glacially slow, moving like a "majestic snail."[33] )Tj
T*(Some find his humanism simple-minded, and his work anti-modern; they criticize )Tj
T*(him for lacking the new modes of expression or experimentation found in works )Tj
T*(of Ray's contemporaries, such as Jean-Luc Godard.[66] As Stanley Kauffman )Tj
T*(wrote, some critics believe that Ray "assumes [viewers] can be interested in a )Tj
T*(film that simply dwells in its characters, rather than one that imposes )Tj
T*(dramatic patterns on their lives."[67] Ray said he could do nothing about the )Tj
T*(slow pace. Kurosawa defended him by saying that Ray's films were not slow, "His )Tj
T*(work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river".[68] )Tj
T*( Critics have often compared Ray to artists in the cinema and other media, such )Tj
T*(as Anton Chekhov, Renoir, De Sica, Howard Hawks or Mozart. The writer V. S. )Tj
T*(Naipaul compared a scene in Shatranj Ki Khiladi \(The Chess Players\) to a )Tj
T*(Shakespearean play; he wrote, "only three hundred words are spoken but )Tj
T*(goodness!¬†‚Äì terrific things happen."[26][69][70] Even critics who did not like )Tj
T*(the aesthetics of Ray's films generally acknowledged his ability to encompass a )Tj
T*(whole culture with all its nuances. Ray's obituary in The Independent included )Tj
T*(the question, "Who else can compete?"[71] )Tj
T*( Political ideologues took issue with Ray's work. In a public debate during the )Tj
T*(1960s, Ray and the Marxist filmmaker Mrinal Sen engaged in an argument. Sen )Tj
T*(criticized him for casting a matin√©e idol such as Uttam Kumar, whom he )Tj
T*(considered a compromise.[72] Ray said that Sen only attacked "easy targets", )Tj
T*(i.e. the Bengali middle-classes. Advocates of socialism said that Ray was not )Tj
T*("committed" to the cause of the nation's downtrodden classes; some critics )Tj
T*(accused him of glorifying poverty in Pather Panchali and Ashani Sanket \(Distant )Tj
T*(Thunder\) through lyricism and aesthetics. They said he provided no solution to )Tj
T*(conflicts in the stories, and was unable to overcome his bourgeoisie )Tj
T*(background. During the naxalite movements in the 1970s, agitators once came )Tj
T*(close to causing physical harm to his son, Sandip.[73] Early in 1980, Ray was )Tj
T*(criticized by an Indian M.P. and former actress Nargis Dutt, who accused Ray of )Tj
T*("exporting poverty." She wanted him to make films to represent "Modern )Tj
T*(India."[74] )Tj

T*(Rituparno Ghosh and Gautam Ghose in India, Tareq Masud and Tanvir Mokammel in )Tj
T*(Bangladesh, and Aneel Ahmad in England, have been influenced by his film craft. )Tj
T*(Across the spectrum, filmmakers such as Budhdhadeb Dasgupta, Mrinal Sen[77] and )Tj
T*(Adoor Gopalakrishnan have acknowledged his seminal contribution to Indian )Tj

T*(Ivory,[80]Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, Fran√ßois Truffaut,[81]Carlos )Tj
T*(Saura,[82]Isao Takahata[83] and Danny Boyle[84] have been influenced by his )Tj
T*(cinematic style, with many others such as Akira Kurosawa praising his )Tj

T*(that of Apur Sansar. Ira Sachs's 2005 work Forty Shades of Blue was a loose )Tj
T*(remake of Charulata. Other references to Ray films are found, for example, in )Tj
T*(recent works such as Sacred Evil,[85] the Elements trilogy of Deepa Mehta and )Tj
T*(even in films of Jean-Luc Godard.[86] According to Michael Sragow of The )Tj
T*(Atlantic Monthly, the "youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art )Tj
T*(houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy".[87] The )Tj
T*(trilogy also introduced the bounce lighting technique.[88]Kanchenjungha \(1962\) )Tj
T*(introduced a narrative structure that resembles later hyperlink )Tj
T*(cinema.[89]Pratidwandi \(1972\) helped pioneer photo-negative flashback and X-ray )Tj
T*(digression techniques.[90] Together with Madhabi Mukherjee, Ray was the first )Tj
T*(Indian film figure to be featured on a foreign stamp \(Dominica\). )Tj
T*( Many literary works include references to Ray or his work, including Saul )Tj
T*(Bellow's Herzog and J. M. Coetzee's Youth. Salman Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea )Tj
T*(of Stories contains fish characters named Goopy and Bagha, a tribute to Ray's )Tj
T*(fantasy film. In 1993, UC Santa Cruz established the Satyajit Ray Film and )Tj
T*(Study collection, and in 1995, the Government of India set up Satyajit Ray Film )Tj
T*(and Television Institute for studies related to film. In 2007, British )Tj
T*(Broadcasting Corporation declared that two Feluda stories would be made into )Tj
T*(radio programs.[91] During the London Film Festival, a regular "Satyajit Ray )Tj
T*(Award" is given to a first-time feature director whose film best captures "the )Tj
T*(artistry, compassion and humanity of Ray's vision". Wes Anderson has claimed )Tj
T*(Ray as an influence on his work; his 2007 film, The Darjeeling Limited, set in )Tj
T*(India, is dedicated to Ray. )Tj
T*( [edit] Awards, honours and recognitions )Tj
T*( Ray received many awards, including 32 National Film Awards by the Government )Tj
T*(of India, and awards at international film festivals. At the 11th Moscow )Tj
T*(International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize )Tj
T*(for the contribution to cinema.[92] At the Berlin Film Festival, he was one of )Tj
T*(only three filmmakers to win the Silver Bear for Best Director more than )Tj

T*(with seven. At the Venice Film Festival, where he had previously won a Golden )Tj

T*( Ernest Augustus I \(5 June 1771¬†‚Äì 18 November 1851\) was King of Hanover from 20 )Tj
T*(June 1837 until his death. He was the fifth son and eighth child of George III, )Tj
T*(who reigned in both the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, initially )Tj
T*(Ernest seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but Salic Law, which barred women )Tj
T*(from the succession, applied in Hanover and none of his older brothers had )Tj
T*(legitimate male issue. Therefore, he became King of Hanover when his niece, )Tj
T*(Victoria, became Queen of the United Kingdom, ending the personal union between )Tj
T*(Britain and Hanover that had existed since 1714. )Tj
T*( Ernest was born in England, but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his )Tj
T*(education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces in )Tj
T*(Wallonia against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. )Tj
T*(In 1799, he was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Although his 1815 )Tj
T*(marriage to the twice-widowed Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the )Tj
T*(disapproval of his mother, Queen Charlotte, it proved a happy relationship. By )Tj
T*(1817, the mad King George III had only one legitimate grandchild, Princess )Tj
T*(Charlotte of Wales, and when she died in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son )Tj
T*(to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This gave him some prospect )Tj
T*(of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried older )Tj
T*(brothers quickly married, and King George's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, )Tj
T*(fathered the eventual British heir, Princess Victoria of Kent \(later Queen )Tj
T*(Victoria\). )Tj
T*( Ernest was active in the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely )Tj
T*(conservative record. There were persistent allegations \(reportedly spread by )Tj
T*(his political foes\) that he had murdered his valet and had fathered a son by )Tj
T*(his sister, Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom. Before Victoria succeeded to )Tj
T*(the British Throne, it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her and take )Tj
T*(the Throne himself. When King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest ascended )Tj

T*(controversy when he dismissed the G√∂ttingen Seven \(including the two Brothers )Tj
T*(Grimm\) from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life \(1771‚Äì1799\) )Tj
T*( Ernest Augustus, the fifth son of George III and Queen Charlotte, was born at )Tj
T*(Buckingham House, now part of Buckingham Palace on 5 June 1771. After leaving )Tj
T*(the nursery, he lived with his two younger brothers, Prince Adolphus \(later )Tj
T*(Duke of Cambridge\) and Prince Augustus \(later Duke of Sussex\), and a tutor in a )Tj
T*(house on Kew Green, near his parents' residence at Kew Palace. At the age of )Tj
T*(fifteen, he and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of )Tj
T*(G√∂ttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover. Though the King never )Tj
T*(left the United Kingdom in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in )Tj
T*(their adolescence. According to historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to )Tj
T*(limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was )Tj
T*(leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers. Prince )Tj
T*(Ernest proved an apt student, and after being tutored privately for a year, )Tj
T*(while learning German, attended lectures at the University. Though King George )Tj
T*(ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines, and that they )Tj
T*(follow university rules, the town merchants proved willing to extend credit to )Tj
T*(the princes, and all three fell into debt. )Tj
T*( In 1790, Ernest asked his father for permission to train with Prussian forces. )Tj
T*(Instead, in January 1791, he and Prince Adolphus were sent to Hanover to )Tj
T*(receive military training under the supervision of Field Marshal Wilhelm von )Tj
T*(Freytag. Before leaving G√∂ttingen, Ernest penned a formal letter of thanks to )Tj
T*(the university, and wrote to his father, "I should be one of the most )Tj
T*(ungrateful of men if ever I was forgetful of all I owe to G√∂ttingen &amp; its )Tj
T*(professors." )Tj
T*( Ernest learned cavalry drill and tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the )Tj
T*(Queen's Light Dragoons, and proved to be an excellent horseman as well as a )Tj
T*(good shot. After only two months of training, von Freytag was so impressed by )Tj
T*(the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. )Tj
T*(Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed )Tj
T*(by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry. )Tj
T*( In March 1792, the King commissioned Prince Ernest Augustus as a colonel in )Tj
T*(the 9th Hanoverian Light Dragoons. The Prince served in the Low Countries in )Tj
T*(the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of )Tj
T*(York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian and Austrian forces. )Tj
T*(Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a )Tj
T*(sabre wound to the head, which resulted in a disfiguring scar. During the )Tj
T*(Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794 his left arm was injured )Tj
T*(by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the )Tj
T*(sight in his left eye faded. In June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his )Tj
T*(first stay there since 1786. )Tj
T*( Ernest resumed his duties in early November, by now promoted to major-general. )Tj
T*(He hoped his new rank would bring him a corps or brigade command, but none was )Tj
T*(forthcoming as Allied armies retreated slowly through the Netherlands towards )Tj
T*(Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover )Tj
T*(over the next year, at several unimportant postings. He had requested a return )Tj
T*(home to seek treatment for his eye, but it was not until early 1796 that the )Tj
T*(King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain. In Britain, Prince Ernest )Tj
T*(consulted the noted eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found the )Tj
T*(condition inoperable, as no operation took place. Once in Britain, Ernest )Tj
T*(repeatedly sought to be allowed to join British forces on the Continent, even )Tj

T*(and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh. Though he was made a lieutenant-general, )Tj
T*(both of British and Hanoverian forces, he remained in England, and, with a seat )Tj
T*(in the House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views, and )Tj
T*(soon became a leader of the right of the party. King George had feared that )Tj
T*(Ernest, like some of his older brothers, would display Whig tendencies. )Tj
T*(Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations )Tj
T*(which led to the formation of the Addington Government. In February 1802, King )Tj
T*(George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which )Tj
T*(offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when )Tj
T*(a vacancy developed. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the )Tj
T*(colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have )Tj
T*(been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led )Tj
T*(it on manoeuvres. )Tj
T*( In early 1803, the Duke of York appointed Ernest as commander of the Severn )Tj
T*(District, in charge of the forces in and around the Severn Estuary. When war )Tj
T*(with France broke out again after the Peace of Amiens, the elder Duke appointed )Tj
T*(Ernest to the more important Southwest District, comprising Hampshire, Dorset )Tj
T*(and Wiltshire. Though Ernest would have preferred command of the King's German )Tj
T*(Legion, composed mostly of expatriates from French-occupied Hanover, he )Tj
T*(accepted the post. The Duke of Cumberland increased the defences on the South )Tj
T*(Coast, especially around the town of Weymouth, where his father often spent )Tj
T*(time in the summer. )Tj
T*( The 1800 Acts of Union had given Ireland representation in Parliament, but )Tj
T*(existing law prevented the Irish Catholics from serving there because of their )Tj
T*(religion. "Catholic emancipation" was a major political issue of the first )Tj
T*(years of the 19th century. The Duke of Cumberland was a strong opponent of )Tj
T*(giving political rights to Catholics, believing that emancipation would be a )Tj
T*(violation of the King's Coronation Oath to uphold Anglicanism, and spoke out in )Tj
T*(the House of Lords against emancipation. Protestant Irish organisations )Tj
T*(supported the Duke; he was elected Chancellor of the University of Dublin in )Tj
T*(1805 and Grand Master of the Orange Lodges two years later. )Tj
T*( The Duke repeatedly sought a post with Allied forces fighting against France, )Tj
T*(but was sent to the Continent only as an observer. In 1807, he advocated )Tj
T*(sending British troops to join with the Prussians and Swedes and attack the )Tj
T*(French at Stralsund \(today, in northeastern Germany\). The Greville government )Tj
T*(refused to send forces. Shortly afterwards, the government fell, and the new )Tj
T*(Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland, agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. )Tj
T*(However, they were sent too late: the French defeated Prussia and Sweden at the )Tj
T*(Battle of Stralsund before Ernest and his forces could reach the town. )Tj
T*( [edit] Sellis incident and Weymouth controversy )Tj
T*( In the early hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck )Tj
T*(in the head several times while asleep in bed, awakening him. He ran for the )Tj
T*(door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help, and one )Tj
T*(of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the )Tj
T*(alarm, and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph )Tj
T*(Sellis, was not among them, and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The )Tj
T*(lock was forced, and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound )Tj
T*(apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the )Tj
T*(apparent attack, and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The )Tj
T*(social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the inquest )Tj
T*(jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to )Tj
T*(study inquest law, and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted )Tj
T*(the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he )Tj
T*(basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous )Tj
T*(verdict of suicide against Sellis. )Tj
T*( Much of the public blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig )Tj
T*(papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious )Tj
T*(explanations for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories )Tj
T*(had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis )Tj

T*(that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had )Tj
T*(played a part in the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who )Tj
T*(wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear )Tj
T*(towards the Duke to the fact that he did not conduct love affairs in public, as )Tj
T*(did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might )Tj
T*(be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst. )Tj
T*( In early 1813, Ernest was involved in political scandal during an election )Tj
T*(contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke )Tj
T*(was shown to be one of three trustees who were able to dictate who would )Tj
T*(represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to )Tj
T*(interfere in a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the )Tj
T*(Government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, )Tj
T*(which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest )Tj
T*(was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies. )Tj
T*( [edit] Marriage )Tj
T*( Ernest met and fell in love in mid-1813 with his first cousin, Frederica of )Tj
T*(Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels and )Tj
T*(widow of Prince Louis of Prussia. The two agreed to wed if Frederica became )Tj
T*(free to marry. Her marriage to Frederick William had not been a success; her )Tj
T*(husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but his )Tj
T*(sudden death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too )Tj
T*(convenient, and suspected the princess of poisoning her husband.Queen Charlotte )Tj
T*(opposed the marriage: before the princess had married Frederick William, she )Tj
T*(had jilted Ernest's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was )Tj
T*(announced. )Tj
T*( Following the marriage in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to )Tj
T*(receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation )Tj
T*(of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers )Tj
T*(attended. The Prince of Wales \(now Prince Regent\) found the Cumberlands' )Tj
T*(presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him money and the Governorship of )Tj
T*(Hanover if they would leave for the Continent. Ernest refused, and the )Tj
T*(Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace for the next )Tj
T*(three years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. )Tj
T*(Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The )Tj
T*(Government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance )Tj
T*(by ‚Ç§6,000 per year in 1815 \(equal to about ‚Ç§386,000 today\),[41] so he could )Tj
T*(meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the )Tj
T*(Weymouth election became an issue, and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool )Tj
T*(tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes. )Tj
T*( At the time of the Duke's marriage in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic )Tj
T*(significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince )Tj
T*(Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young Princess was )Tj
T*(expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially )Tj
T*(after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the )Tj
T*(Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, )Tj
T*(while the next two brothers, the Dukes of Clarence and Kent, were unmarried. On )Tj
T*(6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King )Tj
T*(George was left with twelve surviving children, and no surviving legitimate )Tj
T*(grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable )Tj
T*(brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to father the heir to the throne. )Tj
T*( Seeing little prospect of the Queen giving in and receiving her )Tj
T*(daughter-in-law, the Cumberlands moved to Germany in 1818. They had difficulty )Tj
T*(living within their means in Britain, and the cost of living was much lower in )Tj
T*(Germany. Queen Charlotte died on 17 November 1818, but the Cumberlands remained )Tj
T*(in Germany, living principally in Berlin, where the Duchess had relatives. In )Tj
T*(1817, the Duchess had a stillborn daughter; in 1819 she gave birth to a boy, )Tj
T*(Prince George of Cumberland. The Duke occasionally visited England, where he )Tj

T*(Throne, following the Duke of York \(who would die without legitimate issue in )Tj
T*(1827\), the Duke of Clarence, and Princess Victoria. )Tj
T*( [edit] Politics and unpopularity )Tj
T*( In 1826, Parliament finally voted to increase Ernest's allowance. The )Tj
T*(Liverpool Government argued that the Duke needed an increased allowance to pay )Tj
T*(for Prince George's education; even so, it was opposed by many Whigs. The bill, )Tj
T*(which passed the House of Commons 120‚Äì97, required Prince George to live in )Tj
T*(England if the Duke was to receive the money. )Tj
T*( In 1828, Ernest was staying with the King at Windsor Castle when severe )Tj
T*(disturbances broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent )Tj
T*(supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, )Tj
T*(believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly )Tj
T*(with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington Government announced that it )Tj
T*(would introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. )Tj
T*(Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned )Tj
T*(to London, and was one of the leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, )Tj
T*(influencing King George against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King )Tj
T*(instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of )Tj
T*(this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the )Tj
T*(King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted )Tj
T*(Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government )Tj
T*(united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have )Tj
T*(considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the )Tj
T*(Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The )Tj
T*(bill passed the Lords and became law. )Tj
T*( The Wellington Government hoped that Ernest would return to Germany, but he )Tj
T*(moved his wife and son to Britain in 1829. The Times reported that they would )Tj
T*(live at Windsor in the "Devil's Tower"; instead, the Duke reopened his house at )Tj
T*(Kew. They settled there as rumours flew that Thomas Garth, thought to be the )Tj
T*(illegitimate son of Ernest's sister Princess Sophia, had been fathered by )Tj
T*(Ernest. It was also said that Ernest had blackmailed the King by threatening to )Tj
T*(expose this secret, though Van der Kiste points out that Ernest would have been )Tj
T*(ill-advised to blackmail with a secret which, if exposed, would destroy him. )Tj
T*(These rumours were spread as Ernest journeyed to London to fight against )Tj
T*(Catholic emancipation. Whig politician and diarist Thomas Creevey wrote about )Tj
T*(the Garth rumour in mid-February, and there is some indication the rumours )Tj
T*(began with Princess Lieven, wife of the Russian ambassador. )Tj
T*( Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, that the Duke had been thrown out of )Tj
T*(Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst. In early )Tj
T*(1830, a number of newspapers printed articles hinting that Ernest was having an )Tj
T*(affair with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen now past fifty.[a] In February )Tj
T*(1830, Lord Graves wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her )Tj
T*(innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death \(and the )Tj
T*(day after the inquest\), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's )Tj
T*(death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its )Tj
T*(implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, )Tj
T*(many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide‚Äîor guilty of a second )Tj
T*(murder.[b] The Duke later stated that he had been "accused of every crime in )Tj
T*(the decalogue". Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is )Tj
T*(no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the )Tj
T*(Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that )Tj
T*(no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade )Tj
T*(when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intent to return )Tj
T*(to Britain that "a campaign of unparalleled viciousness" began against him. )Tj
T*(According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England. )Tj
T*( The Duke's influence at Court was ended by the death of George IV in June 1830 )Tj
T*(and the succession of the Duke of Clarence as William IV. Wellington wrote that )Tj
T*("The effect of the King's death will¬†... be to put an end to the Duke of )Tj

T*(William lacked legitimate children \(two girls having died in infancy\) and )Tj
T*(Ernest was now heir-presumptive in Hanover, since the British heir-presumptive, )Tj
T*(Victoria, as a female could not inherit there. William realized that so long as )Tj
T*(the Duke maintained a power base at Windsor, he could wield unwanted influence. )Tj
T*(The Duke was Gold Stick as head of the Household Cavalry; William made the )Tj
T*(Duke's post responsible to the Commander in Chief rather than to the King, and )Tj
T*(an insulted Ernest, outraged at the thought of having to report to an officer )Tj
T*(less senior than himself, resigned. King William again emerged triumphant when )Tj
T*(the new queen, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wished to quarter her horses in the )Tj
T*(stables customarily used by the consort, but which were then occupied by )Tj
T*(Ernest's horses. Ernest initially refused the King's order to remove the )Tj
T*(horses, but gave in when told that William's grooms would remove them if Ernest )Tj
T*(did not move them voluntarily. However, Ernest and William remained friendly )Tj
T*(throughout the latter's seven-year reign. Ernest's house at Kew was too small )Tj
T*(for his family; the King gave the Duke and Duchess lifetime residence in a )Tj
T*(nearby, larger house by the entrance to Kew Gardens. Ernest opposed the Reform )Tj
T*(Act 1832, and was one of the "diehard" peers who voted against the bill on its )Tj
T*(final reading when most Tories abstained under threat of seeing the House of )Tj
T*(Lords flooded with Whig peers. )Tj
T*( Ernest was the subject of more allegations in 1832, when two young women )Tj
T*(accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The )Tj
T*(Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to )Tj
T*(ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have )Tj
T*(seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the )Tj
T*(incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was )Tj
T*(cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for )Tj
T*(libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, )Tj
T*(and the jury found against the author.[c] Also in 1832, the Cumberlands )Tj
T*(suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind )Tj
T*(in one eye from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the )Tj
T*(other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the )Tj
T*(British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George )Tj
T*(could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions about whether he )Tj
T*(should succeed in Hanover. )Tj
T*( The Duke spent William's reign in the House of Lords, where he was assiduous )Tj
T*(in his attendance. Wrote newspaper editor James Grant, "He is literally‚Äîthe )Tj
T*(door-keeper of course excepted‚Äîthe first man in the House, and the last out of )Tj
T*(it. And this not merely generally, but every night." Grant, in his observations )Tj
T*(of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not )Tj
T*(noted for his oratory \(he delivered no speech longer than five minutes\) and had )Tj
T*(a voice that was difficult to understand, though, "his manner is most mild and )Tj
T*(conciliatory." Grant denigrated the Duke's intellect and influence, but stated )Tj
T*(that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that, "he is by )Tj
T*(no means so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose." )Tj
T*( Controversy arose in 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges \(which took )Tj
T*(anti-Catholic views\) were said to be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of )Tj
T*(Cumberland on the Throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph )Tj
T*(Hume, speaking in the House of Commons, Princess Victoria was to be passed over )Tj
T*(on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity. The Commons passed a resolution )Tj
T*(calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, )Tj
T*(the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, "I would shed the last )Tj
T*(drop of my blood for my niece." The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge )Tj
T*(members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. )Tj
T*(According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that )Tj

T*(United Kingdom. Ernest became the King of Hanover. On 28 June 1837, King Ernest )Tj
T*(entered his new domain, passing under a triumphal arch. For the first time in )Tj
T*(over a century, Hanover would have a ruler living there. Many Hanoverians were )Tj
T*(of a liberal perspective, and would have preferred the popular viceroy, the )Tj
T*(Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but both of Ernest's younger brothers )Tj
T*(refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king )Tj
T*(rather than their elder brother. According to Roger Fulford in his study of )Tj
T*(George III's younger sons, Royal Dukes, "In 1837, King Ernest was the only male )Tj
T*(descendant of George III who was willing and able to continue the connection )Tj
T*(with Hanover."[d] )Tj
T*( Hanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in )Tj
T*(1819; this did little more than denote Hanover's change from an electorate to a )Tj
T*(kingdom, granted by the Congress of Vienna. The Duke of Cambridge, as King )Tj
T*(William's viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganisation of the )Tj
T*(Hanoverian government. William IV had given his consent to a new constitution )Tj
T*(in 1833; the Duke of Cumberland's consent was neither asked nor received, and )Tj
T*(he had formally protested against the constitution's adoption without his )Tj
T*(consent. One provision of the constitution transferred the Hanoverian Domains )Tj
T*(\(the equivalent of the British Crown Estate\) from the sovereign to the state, )Tj
T*(eroding the monarch's power. )Tj
T*( Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the King dissolved the parliament )Tj
T*(which had been convened under the disputed constitution. On 5 July, he )Tj
T*(proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the ground that his consent )Tj
T*(had not been asked, and that it did not meet the kingdom's needs. On 1 November )Tj
T*(1837, the King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding )Tj
T*(all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored. The Crown Prince, )Tj
T*(Prince George, endorsed the action. )Tj
T*( In carrying the King's patent into effect, the Cabinet required all )Tj
T*(officeholders \(including professors at G√∂ttingen University\) to renew their )Tj
T*(oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors \(including the two Brothers )Tj
T*(Grimm\) refused to take the oaths, and agitated for others to protest against )Tj
T*(the King's decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their )Tj
T*(positions, and the King expelled the three most responsible \(including Jacob )Tj
T*(Grimm\) from Hanover. Only one of the seven, orientalist Heinrich Ewald was a )Tj
T*(citizen of Hanover and he was not expelled. In the final years of the King's )Tj
T*(reign, the three were invited to return. )Tj
T*( The King wrote of the incident to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of )Tj
T*(Prussia, "If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me )Tj
T*(expressing his opinion, I would have had no cause to take exception to their )Tj
T*(conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the )Tj
T*(Government had received their protest‚Äîthat is what they have done and that I )Tj
T*(cannot allow." Ernest received a deputation of G√∂ttingen citizens, who, fearing )Tj
T*(student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in )Tj
T*(Europe, especially in Britain. In the House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas )Tj
T*(Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen )Tj
T*(Victoria died, making Ernest the British King, Parliament should declare that )Tj
T*(King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British Throne by his actions. )Tj
T*( A more significant protest against the revocation of the 1833 constitution was )Tj
T*(the refusal of a number of towns to appoint parliamentary deputies. However, by )Tj
T*(1840, a sufficient number of deputies had been appointed for the King to summon )Tj
T*(Parliament, which met for two weeks in August, approving a modified version of )Tj
T*(the 1819 constitution, passing a budget, and sending a vote of thanks to the )Tj
T*(King. The Parliament met again the following year, passed a three-year budget, )Tj
T*(and adjourned again. )Tj
T*( [edit] National development and trade; 1848 crisis )Tj
T*( At the time the King took the throne, the city of Hanover was a densely packed )Tj
T*(residential town, and did not rise to the grand style of many German capitals. )Tj
T*(Once the political crises of the first years of his reign had subsided, he set )Tj
T*(out to remedy this state of affairs. Ernest's support led to gas lighting in )Tj

T*(residential quarter. He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica's )Tj
T*(death, to leave standing the Altes Palais, where the two had lived since )Tj
T*(arriving in Hanover. Ernest's interest in and support of the railroads led to )Tj
T*(Hanover becoming a major rail junction, much to the nation's benefit. However, )Tj
T*(when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building )Tj
T*(of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal )Tj
T*("this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this )Tj
T*(green field". The King finally gave his consent in 1844, and the opera house )Tj
T*(opened in 1852, a year after the King's death. )Tj
T*( Every week, the King travelled with his secretary to different parts of his )Tj
T*(kingdom, and anyone could lay a petition before him‚Äîalthough Ernest had )Tj
T*(petitions screened by the secretary so he would not have to deal with frivolous )Tj
T*(complaints. Ernest opened high ministerial positions to those of any class, )Tj
T*(securing the services of several ministers who would not have been eligible )Tj
T*(without this reform. Though the King had, while Duke of Cumberland, fought )Tj
T*(against Catholic emancipation, he made no objection to Catholics in government )Tj
T*(service in Hanover, and even visited their churches. Ernest explained this by )Tj
T*(stating that there were no historical reasons to restrict Catholics in Hanover, )Tj
T*(as there had been in the United Kingdom. He continued to oppose admission of )Tj
T*(Jews into the British Parliament, but gave Jews in Hanover equal rights. )Tj
T*( The King supported a postal union and common currency among the German states, )Tj
T*(but opposed the Prussian-led customs union, the Zollverein, fearing that it )Tj
T*(would lead to Prussian dominance and the end of Hanover as an independent )Tj
T*(state. Instead, the King supported the Steuerverein, which Hanover and other )Tj
T*(western German states had formed in 1834. When the Steuerverein treaties came )Tj
T*(up for renewal in 1841, Brunswick pulled out of the union and joined the )Tj
T*(Zollverein, greatly weakening Hanover's position, especially since Brunswick )Tj
T*(had enclaves within Hanover. Ernest was able to postpone the enclaves' entry )Tj
T*(into the Zollverein, and when a trade war began, was able to outlast Brunswick. )Tj
T*(In 1845, Brunswick, Hanover, and Prussia signed a trade agreement. In 1850, )Tj
T*(Ernest reluctantly permitted Hanover to join the Zollverein, though the entry )Tj
T*(was on favourable terms. Ernest's forebodings about Prussia were warranted; in )Tj
T*(1866, fifteen years after his death, Hanover chose the Austrian side in the )Tj
T*(Austro-Prussian War, was defeated, and was annexed by Prussia. )Tj
T*( Hanover was little affected by the revolutions of 1848; a few small )Tj
T*(disturbances were put down by the cavalry without bloodshed. When agitators )Tj
T*(arrived from Berlin at the end of May 1848, and there were demonstrations )Tj
T*(outside the King's palace, Ernest sent out the Prime Minister. The Prime )Tj
T*(Minister warned that if the demonstrators made any inappropriate demands on the )Tj
T*(King, Ernest would pack up his things and leave for Britain, taking the Crown )Tj
T*(Prince with him. This would leave the country to the mercy of expansionist )Tj
T*(Prussia, and the threat put an end to the agitation. Afterwards, the King )Tj
T*(granted a new constitution, somewhat more liberal than the 1819 document. )Tj
T*( [edit] Relations with Britain )Tj
T*( Ernest Augustus is supposed to have asked the advice of the Duke of Wellington )Tj
T*(as to what course he should take after Victoria's accession, with Wellington )Tj
T*(supposedly saying "Go before you are pelted out." However, Bird dismisses this )Tj
T*(story as unlikely, given Wellington's customary respect to royalty and the fact )Tj
T*(that Ernest had little choice in what to do‚Äîhe had to repair to his kingdom as )Tj
T*(quickly as possible. One decision the new King did have to make was whether, in )Tj
T*(his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the )Tj
T*(House of Lords. Shortly after William's death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst )Tj
T*(that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to )Tj
T*(administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign Sovereign. The King )Tj
T*(hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and )Tj
T*(subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine. Ernest )Tj
T*(was heir presumptive to his niece until the birth of Queen Victoria's daughter, )Tj
T*(also named Victoria, in November 1840. The Lord Privy Seal, Lord Clarendon, )Tj
T*(wrote, "What the country cares about is to have a life more, whether male or )Tj
T*(female, between the succession and the King of Hanover." )Tj

T*( Almost immediately upon going to Hanover, the King became involved in a )Tj
T*(dispute with his niece. Victoria, who had a strained relationship with her )Tj
T*(mother, the Duchess of Kent, wanted to give the Duchess accommodation near her, )Tj
T*(for the sake of appearances‚Äîbut not too near her. To that end, she asked the )Tj
T*(King to give up his apartments at St. James's Palace in favour of the Duchess. )Tj
T*(The King, wishing to retain apartments in London in anticipation of frequent )Tj
T*(visits to England, and reluctant to give way in favour of a woman who had )Tj
T*(frequently fought with his brother, King William, declined, and Victoria )Tj
T*(angrily rented a house for her mother. At a time when the young Queen was )Tj
T*(trying to pay off her father's debts, she saw this as unnecessary expense. Her )Tj
T*(ill-feeling towards the King increased when he refused, and advised his two )Tj
T*(surviving brothers to similarly refuse, to give precedence to her intended )Tj
T*(spouse, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest argued that the standing of the )Tj
T*(various royal families had been settled at the Congress of Vienna, and the King )Tj
T*(of Hanover should not have to yield to one whom he described as a "paper Royal )Tj
T*(Highness". The act which naturalised Albert as a British subject left the )Tj
T*(question of his precedence unresolved. )Tj
T*( Matters came to a head when Ernest returned for what would prove to be his )Tj
T*(only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, )Tj
T*(everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, )Tj
T*(he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The )Tj
T*(50-years-younger prince settled things with what Albert described as a "strong )Tj
T*(push", and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so )Tj
T*(close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King )Tj
T*(apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. )Tj
T*(When Albert demurred on the grounds that they might be jostled by crowds, the )Tj
T*(King replied, "When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they )Tj
T*(never bothered me." Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a )Tj
T*(fall, with Albert writing to his brother, "Happily he fell over some stones in )Tj
T*(Kew and damaged some ribs." This injury spared him further contact with )Tj
T*(Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as )Tj
T*(Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that )Tj
T*(the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, "No, I shall )Tj
T*(not, unless the Devil prompts me!" The Queen also recorded that though King )Tj
T*(Ernest greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak. )Tj

T*(British Crown. King Ernest maintained that they were to go to the heir male, )Tj
T*(that is, himself. The matter was arbitrated, and just as the arbitrators were )Tj
T*(about to announce a decision in Hanover's favour, one of the arbitrators died, )Tj
T*(voiding the decision. Despite the King's request for a new panel, Victoria )Tj
T*(refused to permit one during the King's lifetime, and took every opportunity to )Tj
T*(wear the jewels, causing the King to write to his friend, Lord Strangford, "The )Tj
T*(little Queen looked very fine, I hear, loaded down with my diamonds." The )Tj
T*(King's son and heir, King George V, pressed the matter, and in 1858, after )Tj
T*(another decision in Hanover's favour, the jewels were turned over to the )Tj
T*(Hanoverian ambassador. )Tj
T*( The King made a point of welcoming British visitors, and when one Englishwoman )Tj
T*(told him that she had been lost in the city, the King denied that this was )Tj
T*(possible, as "the whole country is no larger than a fourpenny bit." )Tj
T*( [edit] Later life, death, and memorial )Tj
T*( In 1851, the King undertook a number of journeys around Germany. He accepted )Tj
T*(an invitation from the Prussian Queen-consort to visit Charlottenburg Palace, )Tj
T*(near Berlin. He visited Mecklenburg for the christening of the Grand Duke's )Tj
T*(son, and L√ºneburg to inspect his old regiment. In June Ernest celebrated his )Tj
T*(80th birthday by playing host to the King of Prussia. Late that summer, he )Tj
T*(visited G√∂ttingen, where he opened a new hospital and was given a torchlight )Tj
T*(procession. )Tj
T*( The King continued his interest in British affairs, and wrote to Lord )Tj
T*(Strangford about the Great Exhibition of 1851: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this trumpery must strike )Tj
T*(every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers )Tj
T*(themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the )Tj
T*(Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the )Tj
T*(occasion. The idea¬†... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But )Tj
T*(it seems everything is conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The King died on 18 November 1851 after an illness of about a month. He was )Tj
T*(mourned greatly in Hanover; less so in England where The Times omitted the )Tj
T*(customary black border to its front page and claimed "the good that can be said )Tj
T*(of the Royal dead is little or none." Both he and Queen Frederica rest in a )Tj
T*(mausoleum in the Herrenhausen Gardens. )Tj
T*( A large equestrian statue of King Ernest Augustus may be found in a square )Tj
T*(named after him in front of Hanover Central Station, inscribed with his name )Tj
T*(and the words \(in German\) "To the father of the nation from his loyal people." )Tj
T*(It is a popular meeting place; in the local phrase, people arrange to meet )Tj
T*(unterm Schwanz or "under the tail" \(that is, of the horse which the King )Tj
T*(rides\). )Tj
T*( Although The Times denigrated Ernest's career as Duke of Cumberland, it did )Tj
T*(speak well of his time as King of Hanover, and of his success in keeping )Tj
T*(Hanover stable in 1848: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Above all, he possessed a resolute decision of character, which, however )Tj
T*(unfortunately it may have operated under different conditions, appeared to )Tj
T*(extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the )Tj
T*(revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, )Tj
T*(resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by )Tj
T*(contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to )Tj
T*(abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest )Tj
T*(maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people )Tj
T*(without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on )Tj
T*(the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may )Tj
T*(find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to )Tj
T*(bespeak for it in the scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.)Tj

T*(had a black band at the base of its slightly hooked beak, and its neck and legs )Tj
T*(were long. Both sexes were highly territorial, with large bony knobs on their )Tj
T*(wings that were used in combat. The Rodrigues Solitaire laid a single egg, that )Tj
T*(was incubated in turn by both sexes. Gizzard stones helped digest its food, )Tj
T*(which included fruit and seeds. )Tj
T*( First mentioned during the 17th century, the Rodrigues Solitaire was described )Tj
T*(in detail by Fran√ßois Leguat \(leader of a group of French Huguenot refugees who )Tj
T*(were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691‚Äì1693\). It was hunted by humans and )Tj
T*(introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 1700s. Apart from Leguat's )Tj
T*(account and drawing, and a few other contemporary descriptions, nothing was )Tj
T*(known about the bird until a few subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1789. )Tj
T*(Thousands of bones have subsequently been excavated. It is the only extinct )Tj
T*(bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( Fran√ßois Leguat was the first to refer to the bird as the "Solitaire" )Tj
T*(\(referring to its solitary habits\), but it has been suggested that he borrowed )Tj
T*(the name from a tract mentioning the R√©union Solitaire. The bird was first )Tj
T*(scientifically named as a species of Dodo \(Didus solitarius, based on Leguat's )Tj
T*(description\) by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in the thirteenth edition of Systema )Tj
T*(Naturae.Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville suggested the )Tj
T*(common descent of the Rodrigues Solitaire and the Dodo in 1848. They dissected )Tj
T*(the only known Dodo specimen with soft tissue, comparing it with the few )Tj
T*(Rodrigues Solitaire remains then available.[7] Strickland stated that although )Tj
T*(not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones )Tj
T*(otherwise only known in pigeons. The fact that the Rodrigues Solitaire laid )Tj
T*(only one egg, fed on fruits, was monogamous and cared for its nestlings also )Tj
T*(supported this relationship. Strickland recognized its generic distinction and )Tj
T*(named the new genus Pezophaps, which means "pedestrian pigeon" in ancient )Tj
T*(Greek.[8] The differences between the sexes of the bird were so large that )Tj
T*(Strickland thought they belonged to two species, naming the smaller bird )Tj
T*(Pezophaps minor. Later study of skeletal features by Alfred and Edward Newton )Tj
T*(indicated that the Solitaire was morphologically intermediate between the Dodo )Tj
T*(and ordinary pigeons, but differed from them in its unique wrist-knob. )Tj
T*( The term "Solitaire" has also been used for other species with "solitary" )Tj
T*(habits, such as the R√©union Ibis. Some scientists believed that R√©union was )Tj
T*(home to not only a white Dodo, but also a white bird similar to the Rodrigues )Tj
T*(Solitaire, both of which are now believed to be misinterpretations of old )Tj
T*(reports of the ibis. An atypical 17th-century description of a Dodo and bones )Tj
T*(found on Rodrigues \(now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues Solitaire\) led )Tj
T*(Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a new species, Didus nazarenus; it is now a junior )Tj
T*(synonym of this species. )Tj
T*( For a long time the Dodo and the Rodrigues Solitaire \(collectively termed )Tj
T*("didines"\) were placed in a family of their own, the Raphinae; this was because )Tj
T*(their relationships to other pigeons was unresolved. They were also placed in a )Tj
T*(monotypic family each, Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively, due to the )Tj
T*(suggestion that hey had evolved their similar features independently. Recently, )Tj
T*(osteological and molecular data led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, )Tj
T*(and the Dodo and Rodrigues Solitaire were placed in their own subfamily, )Tj
T*(Raphinae, nested within the Columbidae. )Tj
T*( [edit] Evolution )Tj
T*( Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome b and 12S rRNA sequences isolated from )Tj
T*(the femur of a Rodrigues Solitaire and the tarsal of a Dodo confirmed their )Tj
T*(close relationship, and their placement within the Columbidae. Genetic evidence )Tj
T*(was interpreted to show that the Southeast Asian Nicobar Pigeon is their )Tj
T*(closest living relative, followed by Crowned Pigeons of New Guinea, and the )Tj
T*(superficially Dodo-like Tooth-billed Pigeon from Samoa. The following )Tj
T*(cladogram, from Shapiro et al. \(2002\), shows the Dodo's closest relationships )Tj
T*(within Columbidae, a clade consisting of generally ground-dwelling island )Tj
T*(endemics. )Tj

T*(of Goura and Didunculus, as well as the inclusion of the Pheasant Pigeon and )Tj
T*(the Thick-billed Ground Pigeon at the base of the clade. The 2002 study )Tj
T*(indicated that the ancestors of the Rodrigues Solitaire and the Dodo diverged )Tj
T*(around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands, Mauritius, )Tj
T*(R√©union, and Rodrigues, are of volcanic origin and less than 10 million years )Tj
T*(old, so the ancestors of both birds likely remained capable of flight long )Tj
T*(after the separation of their lineages. The lack of mammalian herbivores )Tj
T*(competing for resources on these islands allowed the Rodrigues Solitaire and )Tj
T*(the Dodo to attain large size. The DNA obtained from the Oxford specimen is )Tj
T*(degraded, and no usable DNA has been extracted from fossil remains, so these )Tj
T*(findings still need to be independently verified. )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( One observer described the Rodrigues Solitaire as the size of a swan. Sexual )Tj
T*(size dimorphism in this species is perhaps the greatest in any carinate bird. )Tj
T*(Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90¬†cm \(35¬†inches\) in )Tj
T*(length and weighing up to 28¬†kg \(62 pounds\), whereas females were 70¬†cm \(28¬†)Tj
T*(inches\) and weighed 17¬†kg \(37 pounds\). Their weight may have varied )Tj
T*(substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool )Tj
T*(seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21¬†kg in )Tj
T*(males and 13¬†kg in females. Their plumage was grey and brown. Females were )Tj
T*(paler than males and had light-coloured elevations on the lower neck. A black )Tj
T*(band \(a contemporary description describes it as a "frontlet"[a]\) appears on )Tj
T*(its head just behind the base of its beak. Its beak was slightly hooked, and )Tj
T*(its neck and legs were long. The skull was 170 millimetres \(6.7¬†in\) long, )Tj
T*(flattened at the top with the fore and hind parts elevated into two bony ridges )Tj
T*(structured with cancellous bone. Both sexes possessed a large a tuberous knob )Tj
T*(of bone situated at the base of the carpometacarpus of each wrist. The knobs )Tj
T*(were about half the length of the metacarpus, and were larger in males than )Tj
T*(females. In life, these knobs would have been covered by tough skin and used as )Tj
T*(weapons. )Tj
T*( The Rodrigues Solitaire shared traits with the Dodo, its closest relative, )Tj
T*(such as size and features in the skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in )Tj
T*(other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the Dodo and had a smaller )Tj
T*(skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were )Tj
T*(proportionally longer, and the Dodo did not possess a wrist-knob equivalent. )Tj
T*(Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues Solitaire and Dodo that are unique )Tj
T*(among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements )Tj
T*(were thicker than those of flighted birds \(to support their greater weight\), )Tj
T*(and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic \(underdeveloped, )Tj
T*(retaining juvenile features\). However, the skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were )Tj
T*(peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity. )Tj
T*( [edit] Contemporary accounts )Tj
T*( Apart from Fran√ßois Leguat's rather simple depiction, the life appearance of )Tj
T*(the Rodrigues Solitaire is only known from a handful of descriptions; no )Tj
T*(soft-tissue remains survive. Leguat devoted three pages of his memoirs to the )Tj
T*(Rodrigues Solitaire, and was clearly impressed by the bird. He described its )Tj
T*(appearance as follows: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Of all the Birds in the Island the most remarkable is that which goes by the )Tj
T*(name of the solitary, because it is very seldom seen in company, tho' there are )Tj
T*(abundance of them. The Feathers of the Males are of a brown grey Colour: the )Tj
T*(Feet and Beak are like a Turkey's, but a little more crooked. They have scarce )Tj
T*(any Tail, but their Hind-part covered with Feathers is roundish, like the )Tj
T*(Crupper [rump] of a horse; they are taller than Turkeys. Their Neck is )Tj
T*(straight, and a little longer in proportion than a Turkey's when it lifts up )Tj
T*(his Head. Its Eye is Black and lively, and its Head without Comb or Cop. They )Tj
T*(never fly, their Wings are too little to support the Weight of their Bodies; )Tj
T*(they serve only to beat themselves, and flutter when they call one another. )Tj
T*(They will whirl about for twenty or thirty times together on the same side, )Tj
T*(during the space of four or five minutes. The motion of their Wings makes then )Tj

T*(The Bone of their Wing grows greater towards the Extremity, and forms a little )Tj
T*(round Mass under the Feathers, as big as a Musket Ball. That and its Beak are )Tj
T*(the chief Defence of this Bird. 'Tis very hard to catch it in the Woods, but )Tj
T*(easie in open Places, because we run faster than they, and sometimes we )Tj
T*(approach them without much Trouble. From March to September they are extremely )Tj
T*(fat, and taste admirably well, especially while they are young, some of the )Tj
T*(Males weigh forty-five Pounds.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Several of Leguat's observations were later confirmed through study of )Tj
T*(subfossil Rodrigues Solitaire remains. The curved contour lines of the pelvis )Tj
T*(also support the roundness of its hind parts, which he compared to that of a )Tj
T*(horse. Also, a ridged surface appears at the base of the beak \(indicating the )Tj
T*(position of the caruncular ridge, which Leguat described as a "widow's peak"\). )Tj
T*(Before fossils of the wrist-knob were found, Strickland noted that the keel of )Tj
T*(the sternum of the Rodrigues Solitaire was so well-developed as to almost )Tj
T*(indicate it had possessed the power of flight; however, since the humerus was )Tj
T*(very short he inferred that this was instead related to Leguat's claim that )Tj
T*(they used their wings for defence.[8] )Tj
T*( Leguat continued with an elaborate description of the female Rodrigues )Tj
T*(Solitaire, which also appears to be the sex depicted in his illustration of the )Tj
T*(bird: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The Females are wonderfully beautiful, some fair, some brown; I call them fair, )Tj
T*(because they are the colour of fair Hair. They have a sort of Peak, like a )Tj
T*(Widow's upon their Breasts [beaks], which is of a dun colour. No one Feather is )Tj
T*(straggling from the other all over their Bodies, they being very careful to )Tj
T*(adjust themselves, and make them all even with their Beaks. The Feathers on )Tj
T*(their Thighs are round like Shells at the end, and being there very thick, have )Tj
T*(an agreeable effect. They have two Risings on their Craws [crop] and the )Tj
T*(Feathers are whiter than the rest, which livelily represents the fine neck of a )Tj
T*(Beautiful Woman. They walk with so much Stateliness and good Grace, that one )Tj
T*(cannot help admiring them and loving them; by which means their fine Mein often )Tj
T*(saves their Lives.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( It has been proposed that Leguat's comparison between the crop of the female )Tj
T*(Rodrigues Solitaire and the "beautiful bosom of a woman" \(changed to "fine )Tj
T*(neck" in some editions of his memoirs\) was out of longing for female )Tj
T*(companionship. )Tj
T*( Another description of its appearance and behaviour is found in an anonymous )Tj
T*(document rediscovered in 1874 called Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue, which has been )Tj
T*(attributed to Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on Rodrigues in 1726: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The solitaire is a large bird, which weighs about forty or fifty pounds. They )Tj
T*(have a very big head, with a sort of frontlet, as if of black velvet. Their )Tj
T*(feathers are neither feathers nor fur; they are of light grey colour, with a )Tj
T*(little black on their backs. Strutting proudly about, either alone or in pairs, )Tj
T*(they preen their plumage or fur with their beak, and keep themselves very )Tj
T*(clean. They have their toes furnished with hard scales, and run with quickness, )Tj
T*(mostly among the rocks, where a man, however agile, can hardly catch them. They )Tj
T*(have a very short beak, of about an inch in length, which is sharp. They, )Tj
T*(nevertheless, do not attempt to hurt anyone, except when they find someone )Tj
T*(before them, and, when hardly pressed, try to bite him. They have a small stump )Tj
T*(of a wing, which has a sort of bullet at its extremity, and serves as a defence.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Behaviour and ecology )Tj
T*( Observations of the Rodrigues Solitaire indicate that they were highly )Tj
T*(territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their )Tj
T*(wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists.[25] It has )Tj

T*(as they resemble diseased bone. Fractures in their wing bones also indicate )Tj
T*(that they were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures )Tj
T*(may have been the result of a hereditary bone disease rather than )Tj
T*(battle-injuries. Some evidence \(including their large size and the fact that )Tj
T*(tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates\) indicates that the )Tj
T*(bird may have had a protracted development period. Several accounts state that )Tj
T*(they defended themselves with a powerful bite. The species may have lived )Tj
T*(primarily in the island's woodlands, rather than on the shores.Pierre-Andr√© )Tj
T*(d'H√©guerty, writing about his time on the island around 1735, stated that a )Tj
T*(captive Rodrigues Solitaire \(which he described as having a melancholic )Tj
T*(appearance\) would always walk in the same line until running out of space, and )Tj
T*(then return back. )Tj
T*( Many other of the endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the )Tj
T*(arrival of man, so the ecosystem of the island is heavily damaged. Before )Tj
T*(humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains )Tj
T*(today due to deforestation. The Rodrigues Solitaire lived alongside other )Tj
T*(recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues Rail, the Rodrigues Parrot, )Tj
T*(Newton's Parakeet, the Rodrigues Starling, the Rodrigues Owl, the Rodrigues )Tj
T*(Night Heron, and the Rodrigues Pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the Domed )Tj
T*(Rodrigues giant tortoise, the Saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the )Tj
T*(Rodrigues day gecko. )Tj
T*( Leguat stated that the Rodrigues Solitaire fed on dates, whereas Tafforet )Tj
T*(mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been )Tj
T*(suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now-extinct )Tj
T*(Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related )Tj
T*(pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have )Tj
T*(covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds )Tj
T*(may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the )Tj
T*(young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to )Tj
T*(the female. It has been suggested that the maximum size attained by the )Tj
T*(Solitaire and the Dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to )Tj
T*(produce for their young during early growth. )Tj
T*( Several contemporary accounts state that the Rodrigues Solitaire used gizzard )Tj
T*(stones. Dodos also did this, which may imply a similar diet. Leguat described )Tj
T*(the stones in the following passage, mentioning that Rodrigues Solitaires )Tj
T*(refused to feed in captivity: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Tho' these Birds will sometimes very familiarly come up near enough to one, )Tj
T*(when we do not run after them, yet they will never grow Tame. As soon as they )Tj
T*(are caught they shed Tears without Crying, and refuse all sustenance till they )Tj
T*(die.)Tj
T*(We find in the Gizzards of both Male and Female, a brown Stone, of the bigness )Tj
T*(of a Hen's Egg, 'tis somewhat rough, flat on one side and round on the other, )Tj
T*(heavy and hard. We believe this Stone was there when they were hatched, for let )Tj
T*(them be never so young, you meet with it always. They never have but one of )Tj
T*('em, and besides, the Passage from the Craw to the Gizard is so narrow, that a )Tj
T*(like Mass of half Bigness cou'd not pass. It serv'd to whet our Knives better )Tj
T*(than any other Stone Whatsoever.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In 1877 three stones were found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a )Tj
T*(Rodrigues Solitaire skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones )Tj
T*(mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones was examined and found to be dolerite: )Tj
T*(somewhat rough, hard and heavy, ca. 50 g. \(1 3/4 oz.\), but hardly flat on one )Tj
T*(side as described by Leguat. This could be due to its association with a young )Tj
T*(individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard )Tj
T*(stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their )Tj

T*(itself in several Months, they will not suffer any other Bird of their Species )Tj
T*(to come within two hundred Yards round of the Place; But what is very singular, )Tj
T*(is, the Males will never drive away the Females, only when he perceives one he )Tj
T*(makes a noise with his Wings to call to the Female, and she drives the )Tj
T*(unwelcome Stranger away, not leaving it till 'tis without her Bounds. The )Tj
T*(Female do's the same as to the Males, whom she leaves to the Male, and he )Tj
T*(drives them away. We have observ'd this several Times, and I affirm it to be )Tj
T*(true.)Tj
T*(The Combats between them on this occasion last sometimes pretty long, because )Tj
T*(the Stranger only turns about, and do's not fly directly from the Nest. )Tj
T*(However, the others do not forsake it till they have quite driven it out of )Tj
T*(their Limits. After these Birds have rais'd their young One, and left it to )Tj
T*(itself, they are always together, which the other Birds are not, and tho' they )Tj
T*(happen to mingle with other Birds of the same Species, these two Companions )Tj
T*(never disunite. We have often remark'd, that some Days after the young leaves )Tj
T*(the Nest, a Company of thirty or forty brings another young one to it, and the )Tj
T*(now fledg'd Bird, with its Father and Mother joyning with the Band, march to )Tj
T*(some bye Place. We frequently follow'd them, and found that afterwards the old )Tj
T*(ones went each their way alone, or in Couples, and left the two young ones )Tj
T*(together, which we call'd a Marriage.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The clutch was described as consisting of a single egg; given the bird's large )Tj
T*(size, this led to proposals that the Solitaire was K-selected, which means it )Tj
T*(produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental )Tj
T*(care until maturity. The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they )Tj
T*(formed cr√®ches, that may have followed foraging adults as part of the learning )Tj
T*(process. )Tj
T*( The size difference between sexes has led to the suggestion that the Rodrigues )Tj
T*(Solitaire was not monogamous as stated by Leguat, and that this )Tj
T*(deeply-religious man attributed the trait to the bird for moral reasons. It has )Tj
T*(been proposed that it was instead polygynous, and the wing-rattling behaviour )Tj
T*(described for males suggests lek-mating, where males gather for competitive )Tj
T*(mating display. However, size dimorphism does occur in some monogamous birds; )Tj
T*(most other pigeons are monogamous as well. )Tj
T*( Tafforet's account of aggressive behaviour confirms Leguat's description, )Tj
T*(adding that Rodrigues Solitaires would even attack humans approaching their )Tj
T*(chicks: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(They do not fly at all, having no feathers to their wings, but they flap them, )Tj
T*(and make a great noise with their wings when angry, and the noise is something )Tj
T*(like thunder in the distance. They only ly, as I am led to suppose, but once in )Tj
T*(the year, and only one egg. Not that I have seen their eggs, for I have not )Tj
T*(been able to discover where they lay. But I have never seen but one little one )Tj
T*(alone with them, and, if any one tried to approach it, they would bite him very )Tj
T*(severely. These birds live on seeds and leaves of trees, which they pick up on )Tj
T*(the ground. They have a gizzard larger than the fist, and what is surprising is )Tj
T*(that there is found in it a stone of the size of a henn's egg, of oval shape, a )Tj
T*(little flattened, although this animal cannot swallow anything larger than a )Tj
T*(small cherry-stone. I have eaten them: they are tolerably well tasted.)Tj

T*(Herbert mentioned "Dodos" on Rodrigues again in 1634, and they were also )Tj
T*(mentioned in 1700. )Tj
T*( The next account, which was the first referring to the bird as the )Tj
T*("Solitaire", was published in Fran√ßois Leguat's 1708 memoir, A New Voyage to )Tj
T*(the East Indies. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot )Tj
T*(refugees, who were the first to colonise the island \(from 1691 to 1693\) after )Tj
T*(they were abandoned there by their captain. His description of the Rodrigues )Tj
T*(Solitaire and its behaviour is the most detailed account of the bird in life, )Tj
T*(and he also described other species that are now extinct. Leguat's observations )Tj
T*(are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the )Tj
T*(wild. He later left for Mauritius, but was too late to observe Dodos there. The )Tj
T*(Huguenots praised the Rodrigues Solitaires for their flavour, especially that )Tj
T*(of the young, and used their gizzard stones as knife sharpeners. D'H√©guerty )Tj
T*(later claimed these were also useful in medicine, and referred to them as )Tj
T*(bezoars. )Tj
T*( Many old accounts mention that Rodrigues Solitaires were hunted by man. )Tj
T*(Writing in 1735, Gennes de la Chanceli√®re described the capture and consumption )Tj
T*(of two specimens as follows: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Our men told of having seen goats and a large quantity of birds of different )Tj
T*(kinds: they brought, amongst others, two of which were bigger by a third than )Tj
T*(the largest turkey; they appeared, nevertheless to be still quite young, still )Tj
T*(having down on the neck and head; their wingtips were but sparsely feathered, )Tj
T*(without any proper tail. Three sailors told me of having seen two others, of )Tj
T*(the same species, as big as the biggest ostrich. The young ones that were )Tj
T*(brought had the head made more or less like the latter animal, but their feet )Tj
T*(were similar to those of turkeys, instead of that of the ostrich which is )Tj
T*(forked and cloven in the shape of a hind's foot. These two birds, when skinned, )Tj
T*(had an inch of fat on the body. One was made into a pie, which turned out to be )Tj
T*(so tough that it was uneatable.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Japetus Steenstrup noted that some Rodrigues Solitaire remains bore traces of )Tj
T*(having been broken by man \(or perhaps another large predator\) to extract bone )Tj
T*(marrow. )Tj
T*( Unlike the Dodo, no Rodrigues Solitaires are known to have been sent to Europe )Tj
T*(alive. However, it has been claimed that Bertrand-Fran√ßois Mah√© de La )Tj
T*(Bourdonnais sent a "Solitaire" to France from the nearby island of R√©union )Tj
T*(around 1740. Since the R√©union Solitaire is believed to have gone extinct by )Tj
T*(this date, the bird may actually have been a Rodrigues Solitaire. )Tj
T*( [edit] Extinction )Tj
T*( In 1755, Joseph-Fran√ßois Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live )Tj
T*(specimen, as he had been assured the Rodrigues Solitaire still survived in )Tj
T*(remote areas of the island. Though trying for 18 months, and offering large )Tj
T*(rewards, none could be found. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the )Tj
T*(species, but suspected that it was due to hunting by humans instead. )Tj
T*( The Rodrigues Solitaire probably became extinct sometime between the 1730s and )Tj
T*(1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise )Tj
T*(trade between 1730 and 1750; traders burnt off vegetation, hunted Solitaires )Tj
T*(and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. )Tj
T*( Alexandre Guy Pingr√© did not encounter any Solitaires when he visited )Tj
T*(Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, although he had been assured )Tj
T*(they survived. His friend, Pierre Charles Le Monnier, named a constellation, )Tj
T*(Turdus Solitarius, after the bird to commemorate the journey. Although the )Tj
T*(Rodrigues Solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation )Tj
T*(named for it, celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked like and star )Tj
T*(maps depict other birds. )Tj
T*( Some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues )Tj
T*(Solitaire. In 1789, subfossil Rodrigues Solitaire bones encrusted in stalagmite )Tj
T*(were discovered in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier about 1830. For unknown )Tj
T*(reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritus, which caused )Tj

T*(found to belong to the same species.[8] Subfossils were also recovered during )Tj
T*(the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of )Tj
T*(Venus, since an observation station was located on the island. Many of these )Tj
T*(excavations were requested by brothers Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them )Tj
T*(to describe the osteology of the bird in detail. Thousands of bones were )Tj

T*( South of Heaven is the fourth studio album by American thrash metal band )Tj
T*(Slayer. Released on July 5, 1988, the album was the band's second collaboration )Tj
T*(with record producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on Slayer's previous )Tj
T*(album Reign in Blood had helped the band's sound evolve. )Tj
T*( South of Heaven was Slayer's second album to enter the Billboard 200, and its )Tj
T*(last to be released by Def Jam Recordings, although the album became an )Tj
T*(American Recordings album after Rick Rubin ended his partnership with Russell )Tj
T*(Simmons. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen )Tj
T*(Records through Warner Bros. Records because of original distributor Columbia )Tj
T*(Records's refusal to release work by the band. The release peaked at number 57 )Tj
T*(and in 1992 was awarded a gold certification by the Recording Industry )Tj
T*(Association of America. )Tj
T*( In order to offset the pace of the group's previous album, Slayer deliberately )Tj
T*(slowed down the album's tempo. In contrast to their previous albums, the band )Tj
T*(utilized undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. While some critics praised )Tj
T*(this musical change, others‚Äîmore accustomed to the style of earlier )Tj
T*(releases‚Äîwere disappointed. Despite this, the songs "Mandatory Suicide" and the )Tj
T*(title track became permanent features of the band's live setlist. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( South of Heaven was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood )Tj
T*(producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's )Tj
T*(production "shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix."[1] )Tj
T*(Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album )Tj
T*(the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they "couldn't )Tj
T*(top Reign in Blood", and that whatever they recorded would be "compared to that )Tj
T*(album", he believed they "had to slow down", something Slayer had never done on )Tj
T*(albums before, or since.[2] Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to "keep people )Tj
T*(guessing" as another reason for the musical shift.[3] "In order to contrast the )Tj
T*(aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down )Tj
T*(the tempo of the album as a whole", according to Slayer's official biography. )Tj
T*("They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles )Tj
T*(not heard on previous albums."[4] )Tj
T*( This was also the first album where bassist/vocalist Tom Araya played his bass )Tj
T*(with a pick \(rather than with his fingers\), and it still continues to be this )Tj
T*(way even in present time. King has since been critical of his performance, )Tj
T*(which he describes as his "most lackluster." King attributes this to the fact )Tj
T*(he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as )Tj
T*("probably the odd man out at that point", he admitted he "didn‚Äôt participate as )Tj
T*(much because of that." Hanneman said: "We go through dry spells sometimes, but )Tj
T*(the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you )Tj
T*(are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry )Tj
T*(spell." King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as )Tj
T*(one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels vocalist Tom Araya moved too )Tj
T*(far away from his regular vocal style, and "added too much singing."[2] Drummer )Tj
T*(Dave Lombardo has since observed: "There was fire on all the records, but it )Tj
T*(started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me )Tj
T*(personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else."[5] )Tj
T*( Judas Priest's "Dissident Aggressor" is the only cover version to appear on a )Tj
T*(Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman )Tj
T*(described the track as "more just like one of those odd songs that a lot of )Tj
T*(people didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked )Tj
T*(that one."[6] Meanwhile, "Cleanse the Soul" has been heavily criticized by King )Tj
T*(who said that he hates the track: "That's one of the black marks in our )Tj
T*(history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [Laughs] I hate the )Tj
T*(opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like )Tj
T*('la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it )Tj
T*(gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of )Tj
T*(that in there."[7] )Tj

T*( South of Heaven was released on July 5, 1988, and was the final Slayer album )Tj
T*(distributed via Def Jam Records. When label co-founders Russell Simmons and )Tj
T*(Rubin parted ways, Slayer signed to Rubin's newly founded Def American )Tj
T*(Recordings label.[9] The album peaked at number 57 on the Billboard 200 album )Tj
T*(chart,[13] and on November 20, 1992, became Slayer's second album to be )Tj
T*(certified gold in the United States.[14]South of Heaven was awarded silver )Tj
T*(certification in the United Kingdom on January 1, 1993, Slayer's first record )Tj
T*(to do so in that country.[15] )Tj
T*( Slayer's official biography states that "some critics praised the album as )Tj
T*(demonstrating Slayer's desire to grow musically and avoid repeating )Tj
T*(themselves."[4] Alex Henderson of AllMusic described the record as "disturbing )Tj
T*(and powerful,"[9] while Joe Matera of Ultimate Guitar deemed the album a slight )Tj
T*(departure; he wrote that while the pace was slowed down, it "didn't sacrifice )Tj
T*(any of the heaviness inherent in Slayer's music."[3] )Tj
T*( Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand )Tj
T*(of PopMatters described the album as "their most underrated, and on this set, )Tj
T*(its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the )Tj
T*(record."[1]KNAC.com's Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a )Tj
T*("grandiosity and imposing presence" which makes the record "so )Tj
T*(magnificent."[16]Grave's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower's Karl Willetts both )Tj
T*(rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time,[17][18] while )Tj
T*(Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song )Tj
T*("Silent Scream" for the first time: "It just blew me away. It was like fast )Tj
T*(double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for )Tj
T*(me."[19] When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman )Tj
T*(Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood "was just speed", South of Heaven )Tj
T*(proved that the group could write "slow material as well."[20] )Tj
T*( However, Kim Neely of Rolling Stone dismissed the album as "genuinely )Tj
T*(offensive satanic drivel."[11] Slayer's official biography states: "The new )Tj
T*(sounds disappointed some of the band's fans who were more accustomed to the )Tj
T*(style of earlier releases."[2] Michael Roberts of Westworld Online said this )Tj
T*(was due to some of the numbers moving "at the sludgier speed of Black )Tj
T*(Sabbath."[21] Araya commented that the "album was a late bloomer‚Äîit wasn't )Tj
T*(really received well, but it kind of grew on everybody later."[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cover versions )Tj
T*( The title track and the song "Mandatory Suicide" have received various cover )Tj
T*(interpretations, particularly on Slayer tribute albums. Toni Ferguson recorded )Tj
T*(string quartet adaptations of both tracks on the album The String Quartet )Tj
T*(Tribute to Slayer: The Evil You Dread, with the former cover being described as )Tj
T*(having "menacing chord shifts" by Allmusic's Johnny Loftus.[22] )Tj
T*( 1995 Slayer tribute album Slatanic Slaughter featured three tracks which )Tj
T*(originally appeared on South of Heaven, with the title track, "Mandatory )Tj
T*(Suicide" and "Spill the Blood" interpreted by Cemetary, Crown of Thorns and )Tj
T*(Grope respectively.[23] Its 1998 follow up Slatanic Slaughter, Vol. 2 only )Tj
T*(featured two tracks originally from the album; namely "Silent Scream" arranged )Tj
T*(by Vader and "Read Between the Lies" interpreted by Anathema.[24] 1999's )Tj

T*( [edit] Live performances )Tj
T*( Two songs taken from the album \("Mandatory Suicide" and "South of Heaven"\) )Tj
T*(have become near constant fixtures in the band's live setlist,[4] notching up )Tj
T*(appearances on the following: the live DVDs Live Intrusion,[32]War at the )Tj
T*(Warfield,[33]Still Reigning,[34]Soundtrack to the Apocalypse's deluxe edition's )Tj
T*(bonus live disc,[35] and the live double album Decade of Aggression.[36] )Tj
T*(Lombardo guested with Finnish cellist group Apocalyptica on a live medley of )Tj
T*(the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven festival in the Netherlands.[37] )Tj
T*(Adrien Begrand of PopMatters described "South of Heaven" as "an unorthodox set )Tj
T*(opener in theory", noting "the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating )Tj
T*(the place: dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser, the )Tj
T*(sinewy opening notes kicked in, followed by an overture of bass, cymbal )Tj
T*(crashes, and tom fills, leading up to the slowly building crescendo" in a )Tj
T*(concert review.[38] Lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of "South )Tj
T*(of Heaven" and thinking "‚ÄòMan! There's just so much groove in that song.‚Äô To my )Tj
T*(kids I was saying, ‚ÄòListen to that! Listen to how groovy that is!‚Äô And it's )Tj
T*(heavy."[5] A rare live version of the track featured on the J√ÑGERMUSIC Rarities )Tj
T*(2004 promotional CD, given away to attendees at the Spring 2004 J√§germeister )Tj
T*(Music Tour.[39] A live rendition of "South of Heaven" was also included on a )Tj
T*(bonus DVD which came with the group's 2007 re-release of ninth studio album )Tj
T*(Christ Illusion, shot in Vancouver, British Columbia during 2006's Unholy )Tj
T*(Alliance tour.[40] )Tj
T*( "Behind the Crooked Cross" is rarely played live as Hanneman hates the track, )Tj
T*(though King has always wanted to play it "because it's got a cool intro" )Tj
T*(despite it not being his favorite song. King said "that's fine" when speaking )Tj
T*(of the situation, noting "there are songs that he wants to play that I always )Tj
T*(shoot down."[2] "Ghosts of War" isn't King's favorite song either, which he )Tj
T*(attests "everybody always wants to hear" performed live. He confessed; "I like )Tj
T*(the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, ‚ÄòLet's put )Tj
T*(the heavy ending at the end of "Chemical Warfare" and just do the last half.‚Äô )Tj
T*(But I could never make that fly."[41] )Tj
T*( Slayer has toyed with the idea of creating a live set mixed with selections )Tj
T*(from the album and 1990's Seasons in the Abyss, though Hanneman has said it's )Tj
T*(something which hasn't been "seriously considered."[42]Metal Maniacs asked )Tj
T*(Slayer in a 2006 interview whether they would consider playing South of Heaven )Tj
T*(in the footsteps of the Still Reigning tour, to which Araya replied, "It's )Tj
T*(becoming a trendy thing now. I don't know. We have some really cool albums, but )Tj
T*(I don't think we'll ever do that again." King was equally unsure, commenting, )Tj

T*(instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were )Tj
T*(contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Richie were assigned the task of )Tj
T*(writing the song. Following several months of working together, the duo )Tj
T*(completed the writing of "We Are the World" one night before the song's first )Tj
T*(recording session, in early 1985. The last recording session for the song was )Tj
T*(held on January 28, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most )Tj
T*(famous artists in the music industry at the time. )Tj
T*( The song was released on March 7, 1985, as the only single from the album. A )Tj
T*(worldwide commercial success, it topped music charts throughout the world and )Tj
T*(became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. The first ever )Tj
T*(single to be certified multi-platinum, "We Are the World" received a Quadruple )Tj
T*(Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. )Tj
T*(However, the song garnered mixed reviews from journalists, music critics, and )Tj
T*(the public. Fans enjoyed hearing racially and musically diverse recording )Tj
T*(artists singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying "We Are the )Tj
T*(World", knowing that the money was going to charity. Other individuals, )Tj
T*(including many commentators in the rock press, were disappointed that the song )Tj
T*(did not challenge listeners as to why famines occur in the first place, and )Tj
T*(felt that the lyrics were self-aggrandizing. )Tj
T*( Awarded numerous honors‚Äîincluding three Grammy Awards, one American Music )Tj
T*(Award, and a People's Choice Award‚Äîthe song was promoted with a critically )Tj
T*(received music video, a home video, a special edition magazine, a simulcast, )Tj
T*(and several books, posters, and shirts. The promotion and merchandise aided the )Tj
T*(success of "We Are the World" and raised over $63¬†million for humanitarian aid )Tj
T*(in Africa and the US. )Tj
T*( Following the devastation caused by the magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake in Haiti )Tj
T*(on January 12, 2010, a remake of the song by another all-star cast of singers )Tj
T*(was recorded on February 1, 2010. Entitled "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", it )Tj
T*(was released as a single on February 12, 2010, and proceeds from the record )Tj
T*(aided survivors in the impoverished country. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background and writing )Tj
T*( Before the writing of "We Are the World", American entertainer and social )Tj
T*(activist Harry Belafonte had sought for some time to have a song recorded by )Tj
T*(the most famous artists in the music industry at the time. He planned to have )Tj
T*(the proceeds donated to a new organization called United Support of Artists for )Tj
T*(Africa \(USA for Africa\). The non-profit foundation would then feed and relieve )Tj
T*(starving people in Africa, specifically Ethiopia, where around one million )Tj
T*(people died during the country's 1984‚Äì1985 famine.[1][2] The idea followed Band )Tj
T*(Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas" project in the UK, which Belafonte had )Tj
T*(heard about.[nb 1][4] In the activist's plans, money would also be set aside to )Tj
T*(help eliminate hunger in the United States of America. Entertainment manager )Tj
T*(and fellow fundraiser Ken Kragen was contacted by Belafonte, who asked for )Tj
T*(singers Lionel Richie and Kenny Rogers‚ÄîKragen's clients‚Äîto participate in )Tj
T*(Belafonte's musical endeavor. Kragen and the two musicians agreed to help with )Tj
T*(Belafonte's mission, and in turn, enlisted the cooperation of Stevie Wonder, to )Tj
T*(add more "name value" to their project.[1]Quincy Jones was drafted to )Tj
T*(co-produce the song, taking time out from his work on The Color Purple.[1][5] )Tj
T*(Richie also telephoned Michael Jackson, who had just released the commercially )Tj
T*(successful Thriller album and had concluded a tour with his brothers.[1] )Tj
T*( Jackson revealed to Richie that he not only wanted to sing the song, but to )Tj
T*(participate in its writing as well.[1][6] To begin with, "We Are the World" was )Tj
T*(to be written by Jackson, Richie, and Wonder. As Wonder had limited time to )Tj
T*(work on the project, Jackson and Richie proceeded to write "We Are the World" )Tj
T*(themselves.[6] They began creating the song at Hayvenhurst, the Jackson family )Tj
T*(home in Encino. For a week, the two spent every night working on lyrics and )Tj
T*(melodies in the singer's bedroom. They knew that they wanted a song that would )Tj
T*(be easy to sing and memorable. The pair wanted to create an anthem. Jackson's )Tj
T*(older sister La¬†Toya watched the two work on the song, and later contended that )Tj
T*(Richie only wrote a few lines for the track.[5] She stated that her younger )Tj

T*(with the American celebrity news magazine People. "I'd go into the room while )Tj
T*(they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael's )Tj
T*(usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them."[6] )Tj
T*( Richie had recorded two melodies for "We Are the World", which Jackson took, )Tj
T*(adding music and words to the song in the same day. Jackson stated, "I love )Tj
T*(working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing, I couldn't wait. I )Tj
T*(went in and came out the same night with the song completed‚Äîdrums, piano, )Tj
T*(strings, and words to the chorus."[7] Jackson then presented his demo to Richie )Tj
T*(and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see the )Tj
T*(structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie )Tj
T*(were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work )Tj
T*(done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson )Tj
T*(completed the lyrics and melody of "We Are the World" within two and a half )Tj
T*(hours, one night before the song's first recording session.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recording sessions )Tj
T*( The first night of recording, January 22, 1985, had tight security on hand, as )Tj
T*(Richie, Jackson, Wonder, and Jones started work on "We Are the World" at Kenny )Tj
T*(Rogers' Lion Share Recording Studio. The studio, on Beverly Boulevard in )Tj
T*(California, was filled with musicians, technicians, video crews, retinues, )Tj
T*(assistants, and organizers as the four musicians entered. To begin the night, a )Tj
T*("vocal guide" of "We Are the World" was recorded by Richie and Jackson and )Tj
T*(duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers. The guide was recorded )Tj
T*(on the sixth take, as Quincy Jones felt that there was too much "thought" in )Tj
T*(the previous versions.[8] )Tj
T*( Following their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began thinking of )Tj
T*(alternatives for the line "There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own )Tj
T*(lives": the pair was concerned that the latter part of the line would be )Tj
T*(considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the )Tj
T*(chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to )Tj
T*("We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. )Tj
T*(Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. "One thing )Tj
T*(we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting )Tj
T*(ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a choice we're making.'"[9] )Tj
T*(Around 1:30¬†am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of )Tj
T*(melodic vocalizations, including the sound "sha-lum sha-lin-gay".[9] Jones told )Tj
T*(the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape. "If we get too )Tj
T*(good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio," he announced.[9] )Tj
T*( On January 24, 1985, after a day of rest, Jones shipped Richie and Jackson's )Tj
T*(vocal guide to all of the artists who would be involved in "We Are the World"'s )Tj
T*(recording. Enclosed in the package was a letter from Jones, addressed to "My )Tj
T*(Fellow Artists":[9] )Tj

T*(The cassettes are numbered, and I can't express how important it is not to let )Tj

T*( Ken Kragen chaired a production meeting at a bungalow off Sunset Boulevard on )Tj
T*(January 25, 1985. There, Kragen and his team discussed where the recording )Tj
T*(sessions with the supergroup of musicians should take place. He stated, "The )Tj

T*(at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.[9] )Tj
T*( The final night of recording was held on January 28, 1985, at A&amp;M )Tj
T*(Recording Studios in Hollywood.[3][9] Michael Jackson arrived at 9¬†pm, earlier )Tj
T*(than the other artists, to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus by )Tj
T*(himself.[9] He was subsequently joined in the recording studio by the remaining )Tj
T*(USA for Africa artists, which included Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, )Tj
T*(Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen and Smokey Robinson. Also in attendance were )Tj
T*(five of Jackson's siblings: Jackie, La¬†Toya, Marlon, Randy and Tito.[10] Many )Tj
T*(of the participants came straight from an American Music Award ceremony, which )Tj
T*(had been held that same night.[5] Invited musician Prince, who would have had a )Tj
T*(part in which he and Michael Jackson sang to each other, did not attend the )Tj
T*(recording session.[11] The reason given for his absence has varied. One )Tj
T*(newspaper claimed that the singer did not want to record with other acts.[12] )Tj
T*(Another report, from the time of "We Are the World"'s recording, suggested that )Tj
T*(the musician did not want to partake in the session because organizer Bob )Tj
T*(Geldof called him a "creep".[13] Prince did, however, donate an exclusive )Tj
T*(track, "4 The Tears In Your Eyes", for the We Are the World album.[12] In all, )Tj
T*(more than 45 of America's top musicians participated in the recording, and )Tj
T*(another 50 had to be turned away.[11][14] Upon entering the recording studio, )Tj
T*(the musicians were greeted by a sign pinned to the door which read, "Please )Tj
T*(check your egos at the door."[15] They were also greeted by Stevie Wonder, who )Tj
T*(proclaimed that if the recording was not completed in one take, he and Ray )Tj

T*(to substitute the "sha-lum sha-lin-gay" sound for a line in Swahili.[17][18] At )Tj
T*(this point, Waylon Jennings left the recording studio and never returned; he )Tj
T*(allegedly felt that no "good ole boy" ever sang in Swahili.[17][18] A heated )Tj
T*(debate ensued, in which several artists rejected the suggestion. The "sha-lum )Tj
T*(sha-lin-gay" sound ran into opposition as well and was subsequently removed )Tj
T*(from the song. The participants eventually decided to sing something meaningful )Tj

T*( "We Are the World" is sung from a first person viewpoint, allowing the )Tj

T*(the song's repetitive chorus proclaim, "We are the world, we are the children, )Tj

T*( [edit] Release and reception )Tj
T*( On March 8, 1985, "We Are the World" was released as a single, in both 7" and )Tj
T*(12" format.[24][25] The song was the only one released from the We Are the )Tj
T*(World album and became a chart success around the world. In the US, it was a )Tj
T*(number one hit on the R&amp;B singles chart, the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks )Tj
T*(chart and the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for a month.[26][27] The )Tj
T*(single had initially debuted at number 21 on the Hot 100, the highest entry )Tj
T*(since Michael Jackson's "Thriller" entered the charts at number 20 the year )Tj
T*(before.[22] It took four weeks for the song to claim the number one spot‚Äîhalf )Tj
T*(the time a single would normally have taken to reach its charting peak.[28] On )Tj
T*(the Hot 100, the song moved from 21 to 5 to 2 and then number 1. "We Are the )Tj
T*(World" might have reached the top of the Hot 100 chart sooner, if it were not )Tj
T*(for the success of Phil Collins' "One More Night", which received a significant )Tj
T*(level of support from both pop and rock listeners.[28] "We Are the World" also )Tj
T*(entered Billboard's Top Rock Tracks and Hot Country Singles charts, where it )Tj
T*(peaked at numbers 27 and 76 respectively.[26] The song became the first single )Tj
T*(since The Beatles' "Let It Be" to enter Billboard's Top 5 within two weeks of )Tj
T*(release.[25] Outside of the US, the single reached number one in Australia, )Tj
T*(France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, )Tj

T*(become the biggest single of the 1980s.[36] "We Are the World" was eventually )Tj
T*(cited as the biggest selling single in both US and pop music history.[nb )Tj
T*(2][38][39][40] The song became the first ever single to be certified )Tj
T*(multi-platinum; it received a 4√ó certification by the Recording Industry )Tj
T*(Association of America.[27][41] The estimated global sales of "We Are the )Tj
T*(World" are said to be 20¬†million.[42] )Tj
T*( Following its release, "We Are the World" received mixed reviews from )Tj
T*(journalists, music critics and the public. American journalist Greil Marcus )Tj
T*(felt that the song sounded like a Pepsi jingle.[43] He wrote, "... the constant )Tj
T*(repetition of 'There's a choice we're making' conflates with Pepsi's )Tj
T*(trademarked 'The choice of a new generation' in a way that, on the part of )Tj
T*(Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly )Tj
T*(not intentional, and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity."[43] )Tj
T*(Marcus added, "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less )Tj
T*(about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi‚Äîand the true result will likely be less )Tj
T*(that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than )Tj
T*(they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its )Tj
T*(advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce )Tj
T*(Springsteen, and all the rest."[43] Author Reebee Garofalo agreed, and )Tj
T*(expressed the opinion that the line "We're saving our own lives" was a )Tj
T*("distasteful element of self-indulgence".[43] He asserted that the artists of )Tj
T*(USA for Africa were proclaiming "their own salvation for singing about an issue )Tj
T*(they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never )Tj
T*(encounter".[43] )Tj
T*( In contrast, Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the phrase "There's )Tj
T*(a choice we're making, We're saving our own lives".[3] He commented that the )Tj
T*(line assumed "an extra emotional dimension when sung by people with superstar )Tj
T*(mystiques".[3] Holden expressed that the song was "an artistic triumph that )Tj
T*(transcends its official nature".[3] He noted that unlike Band Aid's "Do They )Tj
T*(Know It's Christmas", the vocals on "We Are the World" were "artfully )Tj
T*(interwoven" and emphasized the individuality of each singer.[3] Holden )Tj
T*(concluded that "We Are the World" was "a simple, eloquent ballad" and a )Tj
T*("fully-realized pop statement that would sound outstanding even if it weren't )Tj
T*(recorded by stars".[3] )Tj
T*( The song proved popular with both young and old listeners.[22] The public )Tj
T*(enjoyed hearing a supergroup of musicians singing together on one track, and )Tj
T*(felt satisfied in buying the record, knowing that the money would go towards a )Tj
T*(good cause.[22] People reported they bought more than one copy of the single, )Tj
T*(some buying up to five copies of the record.[44] One mother from Columbia, )Tj
T*(Missouri purchased two copies of "We Are the World", stating, "The record is )Tj
T*(excellent whether it's for a cause or not. It's fun trying to identify the )Tj
T*(different artists. It was a good feeling knowing that I was helping someone in )Tj
T*(need."[22] )Tj
T*( According to music critic and Bruce Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, "We Are )Tj
T*(the World" was not widely accepted within the rock music community.[45] The )Tj
T*(author revealed that the song was "despised" for what it was not: "a rock )Tj
T*(record, a critique of the political policies that created the famine, a way of )Tj
T*(finding out how and why famines occur, an all-inclusive representation of the )Tj
T*(entire worldwide spectrum of post-Presley popular music".[45] Marsh revealed )Tj
T*(that he felt some of the criticisms were right, while others were silly.[45] He )Tj
T*(claimed that despite the sentimentality of the song, "We Are the World" was a )Tj
T*(large-scale pop event with serious political overtones.[45] )Tj
T*( "We Are the World" was recognized with several awards following its release. )Tj
T*(At the 1986 Grammy Awards, the song and its accompanying music video won four )Tj
T*(awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or )Tj

T*( "We Are the World" was promoted with a music video, a video cassette, and )Tj
T*(several other items made available to the public, including books, posters, )Tj
T*(shirts and buttons.[50][51] All proceeds from the sale of official USA for )Tj
T*(Africa merchandise went directly to the famine relief fund. All of the )Tj
T*(merchandise sold well; the video cassette‚Äîentitled We Are the World: The Video )Tj
T*(Event‚Äîdocumented the making of the song, and became the ninth best-selling home )Tj
T*(video of 1985.[50] All of the video elements were produced by Howard G. Malley )Tj
T*(and Craig B. Golin along with April Lee Grebb as the production supervisor. )Tj
T*( The music video showed the recording of "We Are the World", and drew criticism )Tj
T*(from some. Michael Jackson joked before filming, "People will know it's me as )Tj
T*(soon as they see the socks. Try taking footage of Bruce Springsteen's socks and )Tj
T*(see if anyone knows who they belong to."[24] Jackson was also criticized for )Tj
T*(filming and recording his solo piece privately, away from the other artists. )Tj
T*(The singer's supporters reasoned that Jackson was a perfectionist; recording in )Tj
T*(front of other big name artists would leave him awestruck and unable to perform )Tj
T*(at his best. He was also known for his shy nature, and the idea of singing solo )Tj
T*(in front of 44 other famous artists probably sounded terrifying to him. )Tj
T*( The song was also promoted with a special edition of the American magazine )Tj
T*(Life. The publication had been the only media outlet permitted inside A&amp;M )Tj
T*(Recording Studios on the night of January 28, 1985. All other press )Tj
T*(organizations were barred from reporting the events leading up to and during )Tj
T*("We Are the World"'s recording. Life ran a cover story of the recording session )Tj
T*(in its April 1985 edition of the monthly magazine. Seven members of USA for )Tj
T*(Africa were pictured on the cover: Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, )Tj
T*(Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Willie Nelson. Inside the )Tj
T*(magazine were photographs of the "We Are the World" participants working and )Tj
T*(taking breaks.[50] )Tj
T*( On the morning of April 5, 1985 \(Good Friday of that year\), "We Are the World" )Tj
T*(received worldwide coverage. At 10:25¬†am, over 8000 radio stations )Tj
T*(simultaneously broadcast the song around the world. They played it to show )Tj
T*(their support for the relief of famine in Ethiopia.[27] The song was also )Tj
T*(broadcast by Muzak, a company which pipes background music into 110,000 stores )Tj
T*(and businesses in the US. It was the second time Muzak had played the sound of )Tj
T*("human voice", the first being an announcement on the release of American )Tj

T*(the World"'s co-writer, Michael Jackson, had wanted his song to be the official )Tj
T*(theme for the event. The other board members of USA for Africa outvoted the )Tj
T*(singer, and it was instead decided that a new song would be created and )Tj
T*(released for the event, titled "Hands Across America".[46] When released, the )Tj
T*(new song did not achieve the level of success that "We Are the World" did, and )Tj
T*(the decision to use it as the official theme for the event led to Jackson‚Äîwho )Tj
T*(co-owned the publishing rights to "We Are the World"‚Äîresigning from the board )Tj
T*(of directors of USA for Africa.[46][58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Humanitarian aid )Tj
T*( Four months after the release of "We Are the World", USA for Africa had taken )Tj
T*(in almost $10.8¬†million.[59][60] The majority of the money came from record )Tj
T*(sales within the US.[59][60] Members of the public also donated money‚Äîalmost )Tj
T*($1.3¬†million within the same time period. In May 1985, USA for Africa officials )Tj
T*(estimated that they had sold between $45¬†million and $47¬†million worth of )Tj
T*(official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced that they )Tj
T*(would not be distributing all of the money at once. Instead, he revealed that )Tj
T*(the foundation would be looking into finding a long-term solution for Africa's )Tj
T*(problems.[59] "We could go out and spend it all in one shot. Maybe we'd save )Tj
T*(some lives in the short term but it would be like putting a Band-Aid over a )Tj
T*(serious wound."[59] Kragen noted that experts had predicted that it would take )Tj
T*(at least 10 to 20¬†years to make a slight difference to Africa's long-term )Tj
T*(problems.[59] )Tj
T*( In June 1985, the first USA for Africa cargo jet carrying food, medicine and )Tj
T*(clothing departed for Ethiopia and the Sudan. It stopped en route in New York, )Tj
T*(where 15,000¬†T-shirts were added to the cargo. Included in the supplies were )Tj
T*(high-protein biscuits, high-protein vitamins, medicine, tents, blankets and )Tj
T*(refrigeration equipment.[61] Harry Belafonte, representing the USA for Africa )Tj
T*(musicians, visited Sudan in the same month. The trip was his last stop on a )Tj
T*(four nation tour of Africa. Tanzanian Prime Minister Salim Ahmed Salim greeted )Tj
T*(and praised Belafonte, telling him, "I personally and the people of Tanzania )Tj
T*(are moved by this tremendous example of human solidarity."[62] )Tj
T*( One year after the release of "We Are the World", organizers noted that $44.5¬†)Tj
T*(million had been raised for USA for Africa's humanitarian fund. They stated )Tj
T*(that they were confident that they would reach an initial set target of $50¬†)Tj
T*(million.[63] By October 1986, it was revealed that their $50¬†million target had )Tj
T*(been met and exceeded; CBS Records gave USA for Africa a check for $2.5¬†)Tj
T*(million, drawing the total amount of money to $51.2¬†million.[64] USA for )Tj
T*(Africa's Hands Across America event had also raised a significant amount of )Tj
T*(money‚Äîapproximately $24.5¬†million for the hungry in the US.[64] )Tj
T*( Since its release, "We Are the World" has raised over $63¬†million for )Tj
T*(humanitarian causes.[65] Ninety percent of the money was pledged to African )Tj
T*(relief, both long and short term.[64][66] The long term initiative included )Tj
T*(efforts in birth control and food production.[66] The remaining 10¬†percent of )Tj
T*(funds was earmarked for domestic hunger and homeless programs in the )Tj
T*(US.[64][66] From the African fund, over 70¬†recovery and development projects )Tj
T*(were launched in seven African nations. Such projects included aid in )Tj
T*(agriculture, fishing, water management, manufacturing and reforestation. )Tj
T*(Training programs were also developed in the African countries of Mozambique, )Tj
T*(Senegal, Chad, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Mali.[64] )Tj
T*( [edit] Notable live performances )Tj
T*( "We Are the World" has been performed live by members of USA for Africa on )Tj
T*(several occasions both together and individually. One of the earliest such )Tj
T*(performances came in 1985, during the rock music concert Live Aid, which ended )Tj
T*(with more than 100¬†musicians singing the song on stage.[67][68] Harry Belafonte )Tj
T*(and Lionel Richie made surprise appearances for the live rendition of the )Tj
T*(song.[69] Michael Jackson would have joined the artists, but was "working )Tj
T*(around the clock in the studio on a project that he's made a major commitment )Tj
T*(to", according to his press agent, Norman Winter.[70] )Tj

T*(Chelsea, and his wife Hillary singing the song along with USA for Africa's )Tj
T*(Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson.[71]The New York Times' Edward )Tj

T*( Michael Jackson died in June 2009, after suffering a cardiac arrest.[75]His )Tj
T*(memorial service was held several days later on July 7, and was reported to )Tj
T*(have been viewed by more than one billion people.[76] The finale of the event )Tj
T*(featured group renditions of the Jackson anthems "We Are the World" and "Heal )Tj

T*(Phinnessee, who had worked with Jackson since the late 1980s.[77][78] It also )Tj
T*(featured co-writer Lionel Richie and Jackson's family, including his )Tj

T*(US charts for the first time since its 1985 release. The song debuted at number )Tj

T*( [edit] 25 for Haiti )Tj
T*( On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by a magnitude-7.0 earthquake, the )Tj
T*(country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years.[82] The epicenter of the )Tj
T*(quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince.[83] Over 230,000 )Tj
T*(civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the )Tj
T*(disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people )Tj
T*(are homeless and it has been reported that the lack of temporary shelter may )Tj
T*(lead to the outbreak of disease.[84][85] )Tj
T*( To raise money for earthquake victims, a new celebrity version of "We Are the )Tj
T*(World" was recorded on February 1, 2010 and released on February 12, 2010. Over )Tj
T*(75 musicians were involved in the remake, which was recorded in the same studio )Tj
T*(as the 1985 original.[86] The new version features revised lyrics as well as a )Tj
T*(rap segment pertaining to Haiti.[86][87] Michael Jackson's younger sister Janet )Tj
T*(duets with her late brother on the track, as per a request from their mother )Tj
T*(Katherine. In the video and on the track, archive material of Michael Jackson )Tj
T*(is used from the original 1985 recording.[88] )Tj
T*( On February 20, 2010, a non-celebrity remake, "We Are the World 25 for Haiti )Tj
T*(\(YouTube Edition\)", was posted to the video sharing website YouTube. Internet )Tj
T*(personality and singer-songwriter Lisa Lavie conceived and organized the )Tj
T*(Internet collaboration of 57 unsigned or independent YouTube musicians )Tj
T*(geographically distributed around the world. Lavie's 2010 YouTube version, a )Tj
T*(cover of the 1985 original, excludes the rap segment and minimizes the )Tj
T*(Auto-tune that characterizes the 2010 celebrity remake.[89] Another 2010 remake )Tj
T*(of the original is the Spanish-language "Somos El Mundo". It was written by )Tj
T*(Emilio Estefan and his wife Gloria Estefan, and produced by Emilio, Quincy )Tj
T*(Jones and Univision Communications, the company that funded the project.[90] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( "We Are the World" has been recognized as a politically important song, which )Tj
T*("affected an international focus on Africa that was simply unprecedented".[43] )Tj
T*(It has been credited with creating a climate in which musicians from around the )Tj

T*(racially diverse musicians could work together both productively and )Tj
T*(creatively.[45]Ebony described the January 28 recording session, in which )Tj
T*(Quincy Jones brought together a multi-racial group, as being "a major moment in )Tj
T*(world music that showed we can change the world".[92] "We Are the World", along )Tj
T*(with Live Aid and Farm Aid, demonstrated that rock music had become more than )Tj
T*(entertainment, but a political and social movement.[93] Journalist Robert )Tj
T*(Palmer noted that such songs and events had the ability to reach people around )Tj
T*(the world, send them a message, and then get results.[93] )Tj
T*( Since the release of "We Are the World", numerous songs have been recorded in )Tj
T*(a similar fashion, with the intent to aid famine victims throughout the world. )Tj
T*(One such example involved a supergroup of Latin musicians billed as "Hermanos )Tj
T*(del Tercer Mundo", or "Brothers of the Third World". Among the supergroup of 62¬†)Tj
T*(recording artists were Julio Iglesias, Jos√© Feliciano and S√©rgio Mendes. Their )Tj
T*(famine relief song was recorded in the same studio as "We Are the World". Half )Tj
T*(of the profits raised from the charity single was pledged to USA for Africa. )Tj
T*(The rest of the money was to be used for impoverished Latin American )Tj
T*(countries.[94] )Tj
T*( The 20th anniversary of "We Are the World" was celebrated in 2005. Radio )Tj
T*(stations around the world paid homage to Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and USA )Tj
T*(for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In )Tj
T*(addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by the release of a )Tj
T*(two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song.[95] Ken Kragen )Tj
T*(asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA )Tj
T*(for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to "use it to do some )Tj
T*(more good [for the original charity]. That's all we care about )Tj
T*(accomplishing."[95] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20th¬†anniversary of )Tj
T*(the song. The entertainer acknowledged that "We Are the World" had "stood the )Tj
T*(test of time"; anyone old enough to remember it can still at least hum )Tj

T*( [edit] Meteorological history )Tj
T*( The origin of Hurricane Mitch can be traced to a tropical wave that moved off )Tj
T*(the coast of Africa on October 10. It moved westward across the shear-ridden )Tj
T*(Atlantic Ocean, and remained disorganized until entering the Caribbean Sea on )Tj
T*(October 18. Upon entering the western Caribbean Sea, convection steadily )Tj
T*(increased, and on October 22, the wave organized into Tropical Depression )Tj
T*(Thirteen while 415¬†mi \(670¬†km\) south of Kingston, Jamaica. Under weak steering )Tj
T*(currents, it drifted westward and intensified into a tropical storm on October )Tj
T*(23 while 260¬†mi \(420¬†km\) east-southeast of San Andr√©s Island.[1] )Tj
T*( Initially, intensification was limited due to an upper-level low causing )Tj
T*(vertical wind shear over Tropical Storm Mitch. As the storm executed a small )Tj
T*(loop to the north, the shear weakened, allowing the system to strengthen. Mitch )Tj
T*(attained hurricane status on October 24 while 295¬†mi \(475¬†km\) south of Jamaica, )Tj
T*(and with warm water temperatures and well-defined outflow, the hurricane )Tj
T*(rapidly strengthened. During a 48-hour period from October 23 to October 25, )Tj
T*(the central pressure dropped 52¬†mbar, and on October 26, Mitch reached peak )Tj
T*(intensity with 180¬†mph \(290¬†km/h\) winds and a pressure of 905¬†mbar, one of the )Tj
T*(lowest pressures ever recorded in an Atlantic hurricane.[1] )Tj
T*( The hurricane moved westward, resulting in land interaction with Honduras. )Tj
T*(This weakened Mitch slightly, and after passing over the Swan Islands on )Tj
T*(October 27, the hurricane steadily weakened. The hurricane drifted southward )Tj
T*(along the Honduran coastline, and made landfall 80¬†mi \(130¬†km\) east of La Ceiba )Tj

T*(of 1780, displacing the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 as the second-deadliest on )Tj
T*(record. Nearly eleven thousand people were confirmed dead, and almost as many )Tj
T*(reported missing. Deaths were mostly from flooding and mudslides in Central )Tj
T*(America, where the slow-moving hurricane and then tropical storm dropped nearly )Tj

T*( [edit] Honduras )Tj
T*( Prior to hitting Honduras, Hurricane Mitch sent waves of up to 22¬†feet \(6.7¬†m\) )Tj
T*(in height to the coast. Upon making landfall, it diminished in intensity, but )Tj
T*(still caused a strong storm surge and waves of 12¬†feet \(3.7¬†m\) in height.[12] )Tj

T*(to six times its normal width. The widespread flooding was partially caused by )Tj
T*(Honduras' slash-and-burn agriculture, so the forests could not absorb any )Tj
T*(moisture.[13] In addition, there were estimates of as high as 75 inches \(1,900¬†)Tj

T*(Mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country.[26] Numerous rivers )Tj
T*(exceeded their crests, though the rainfall was beneficial to trees in )Tj
T*(mountainous areas.[27] The flooding caused extensive crop damage and destroyed )Tj

T*( In Mexico, Mitch produced gusty winds and heavy rains on the Yucat√°n )Tj

T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( Because of the hurricane's destruction in Central America and elsewhere in )Tj
T*(North America, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Mitch in )Tj
T*(the spring of 1999; it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The )Tj
T*(name was replaced with Matthew in the 2004 season. )Tj
T*( After the disaster caused by Hurricane Mitch, countries around the world )Tj
T*(donated significant aid, totaling $6.3¬†billion \(1998¬†USD, $8.6¬†billion 2011¬†)Tj
T*(USD\). Throughout Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis )Tj
T*(that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure )Tj
T*(and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the )Tj
T*(affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring )Tj
T*(again.[13] )Tj
T*( Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, but many took this as an )Tj
T*(opportunity to rebuild stronger houses. With a new, structurally improved )Tj
T*(foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane. )Tj
T*(However, lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many, decreasing an )Tj
T*(already low income even lower.[31] )Tj
T*( Following the passage of Mitch, disease outbreaks occurred throughout Central )Tj
T*(America, including cholera, leptospirosis, and dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases )Tj
T*(of cholera were reported, killing 34¬†people. Guatemala was most affected by the )Tj
T*(bacterium, where most of the deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases )Tj
T*(of leptospirosis were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were )Tj
T*(over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the )Tj
T*(disease.[32] )Tj
T*( While stalling over the western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's strong winds produced )Tj
T*(strong waves, damaging local coral reefs. Later, the storm's immense rainfall )Tj
T*(led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water. This resulted in diseases )Tj
T*(occurring within the coral. However, the hurricane's upwelling cooled the warm )Tj
T*(water temperatures, preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the )Tj
T*(coral reef.[33] )Tj

T*( Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid )Tj
T*(for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending )Tj
T*(700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, )Tj
T*(and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of )Tj
T*(physicians to the country.[34] The U.S. administration offered at first troops )Tj
T*(stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them a few days after the storm. They )Tj
T*(also at first offered only $2¬†million \(1998¬†USD, $2.7¬†million 2011¬†USD\) in aid, )Tj

T*(The U.S. later increased their offer to $70¬†million \(1998¬†USD, $95¬†million 2011¬†)Tj

T*( Geastrum quadrifidum, commonly known as the rayed earthstar or four-footed )Tj
T*(earthstar, is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to the genus Geastrum, )Tj
T*(or earthstar fungi. First described scientifically by Christian Hendrik Persoon )Tj
T*(in 1794, G.¬†quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan‚Äîbut not common‚Äîspecies of Europe, the )Tj
T*(Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a saprobe, feeding off )Tj
T*(decomposing organic matter present in the soil and litter of coniferous )Tj
T*(forests. )Tj
T*( The small, tough, fruit bodies are grayish-brown balls that are initially )Tj
T*(enclosed by a skin, or peridium, made up of four distinct layers of tissue. The )Tj
T*(outer tissue layer splits to form star-like rays and expose a circular spore )Tj
T*(case. Inside the spore case is the gleba‚Äîfertile spore-producing tissue that is )Tj
T*(white and firm when young, but becomes brown and powdery in age. The )Tj
T*(grayish-brown spore case is set on a short, slender stalk, and has a )Tj
T*(well-defined narrow pore at the top where mature spores may escape. Fully )Tj
T*(expanded, the fruit body reaches dimensions up to 2‚Äì3¬†cm \(0.8‚Äì1.2¬†in\) wide and )Tj
T*(up to about 3¬†cm \(1.2¬†in\) tall. The outer skin is purplish-brown, with four or )Tj
T*(five cream or yellowish-brown colored rays that have their tips stuck in the )Tj
T*(substrate. There is a flat mat of interwoven mycelia between ray tips. The )Tj
T*(spores are spherical, warty, and have a diameter of up to 6¬†¬µm. Geastrum )Tj
T*(quadrifidum is one of a number of earthstars whose rays arch downward as they )Tj
T*(mature, lifting the spore sac upward, high enough to catch air currents that )Tj
T*(disseminate the spores into new habitats. The species is easily confused with )Tj
T*(Geastrum fornicatum, a larger earthstar without a well-defined pore mouth. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy and naming )Tj
T*( The Dutch mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon published the first official )Tj
T*(description of Geastrum quadrifidum in 1794,[3] and later sanctioned this name )Tj
T*(in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum \(as Geastrum quadrifidum var. minus, a )Tj
T*(variety now considered synonymous with G.¬†quadrifidum\).[4] Although the species )Tj
T*(had been previously described as Lycoperdon coronatum by Jacob Christian )Tj
T*(Schaeffer \(1763\) and Giovanni Antonio Scopoli \(1772\),[5] then afterward as )Tj
T*(Geaster coronatus by Joseph Schr√∂ter \(1889\),[6][nb 1] the epithet coronatus is )Tj
T*(not to be used because of the existence of the sanctioned name.[8] )Tj
T*( In Japan, G.¬†quadrifidum has occasionally been called "Geastrum minus" \(Pers.\) )Tj
T*(G. Cunn. \(for example, as in Imai, 1936\);[9] within taxonomical terminology, )Tj
T*(this usage is an auctorum non‚Äîa misapplication or misinterpretation of the )Tj
T*(species name.[10] )Tj
T*( According to Stanek's classification of the genus Geastrum,[11] \(a )Tj
T*(classification later endorsed in Sunhede's 1989 monograph of European Geastrum )Tj
T*(species\), G.¬†quadrifidum belongs in the subsection Glabrostoma of the section )Tj

T*(Several common names for G.¬†quadrifidum have been suggested, including "rayed )Tj
T*(earthstar",[12] "four-pointed earthstar"[13] and "four-footed )Tj
T*(earthstar".[14]Samuel Frederick Gray called it the "four-cut shell-puff" in his )Tj
T*(1821 The Natural Arrangement of British Plants,[15] but the name was not )Tj
T*(adopted by subsequent authors. The specific epithet quadrifidum is derived from )Tj
T*(Latin, and means "four-forks".[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( As in all Geastrum fungi, the internal spore-producing gleba is enclosed in )Tj
T*(the peridium, a protective structure composed of four layers of tissue: an )Tj
T*(inner endoperidium, and outer exoperidium that may further be divided into an )Tj
T*(external mycelial, a tough and membranous middle fibrillose layer, and an )Tj
T*(internal fleshy layer \(known as the pseudoparenchyma\).[17] The immature, )Tj
T*(unopened fruit body is roughly spherical to somewhat flattened or irregular in )Tj
T*(shape. It lies partly or wholly submerged, encrusted with debris. The expanded )Tj
T*(fruit body is usually taller than it is wide, about 10‚Äì40¬†mm \(0.4‚Äì1.6¬†in\) high, )Tj
T*(with mycelial cup included about 15‚Äì55¬†mm \(0.6‚Äì2.2¬†in\). The exoperidium \(the )Tj
T*(outer tissue layer of the four-layered peridium\) splits in the middle into )Tj
T*(three to six, but usually four or five rays. The exoperidium is typically )Tj
T*(fornicate‚Äîa structural feature that arises when the mesoperidium separates from )Tj
T*(the exoperidium, adhering only at the edge. In this way, the endoperidium \(the )Tj
T*(internal tissue layer that encloses the spore sac\) is lifted upwards with the )Tj
T*(downward movement of the rays. In this species, the tips of the rays remain )Tj
T*(attached to the mycelial layer, which remain attached to the substrate as a cup )Tj
T*(in the ground.[18] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Fresh fruit bodies have a fleshy white to cream-colored exoperidium. This )Tj
T*(individual has a pseudoparenchymatous collar, the thickness of which hides the )Tj
T*(short stalk that supports the spore sac. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( When the pseudoparenchymatous layer dries it shrinks and hardens, darkening to )Tj
T*(brown; the structure is maintained by the underlying stiff papery fibrous )Tj
T*(layer. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Unlike those of some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.¬†quadrifidum are )Tj
T*(not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity. )Tj
T*(Generally, the rays are broad, but they may seem narrow as their edges are )Tj
T*(often rolled inwards. The width of the exoperidium \(when still attached to the )Tj
T*(mycelial cup\) is 8‚Äì25¬†mm \(0.3‚Äì1.0¬†in\), when fully expanded about 15‚Äì90¬†mm )Tj
T*(\(0.6‚Äì3.5¬†in\). The pseudoparenchymatous layer when fresh is about 1‚Äì2¬†mm thick, )Tj
T*(initially whitish, later turning beige to brownish \(sometimes over reddish )Tj
T*(tints\), and dark brown when old. In newly expanded specimens this layer is )Tj
T*(covered with a thin layer of crystals and hyphae, sometimes forming a )Tj
T*(pseudoparenchymatous cup or collar that often peels off in patches, when dry )Tj
T*(shrunken and hard. The fibrous layer is papery to leathery. The inner side, )Tj
T*(when free from pseudoparenchymatous remnants, is almost white, in age becoming )Tj
T*(dirty grayish-white and sometimes greenish due to algae; the outer side is )Tj
T*(initially whitish, somewhat glossy, but in age becomes grayish-white and dull. )Tj
T*(The mycelial layer has a whitish inner side and is strongly attached to the )Tj
T*(litter on its outer side. It persists for a long time \(1‚Äì2-year-old fruit )Tj
T*(bodies with intact mycelial cups have been found\).[18] )Tj
T*( The spore sac is variable in shape, ranging from roughly spherical to )Tj
T*(egg-shaped or irregular, but it is usually taller than it is wide. Its diameter )Tj

T*(The hyphal part is less than 1‚Äì6 x 1‚Äì2¬†¬µm. The sterigmata \(thin projections of )Tj
T*(the basidia that attach the to spore\) are 4‚Äì6¬†¬µm long and mostly 1‚Äì1.5¬†¬µm )Tj
T*(thick. The hyphae located immediately underneath the basidia are thin-walled, )Tj
T*(1‚Äì2¬†¬µm wide, provided with clamps and densely branched. The hyphae of the )Tj
T*(tramal plates are roughly parallel, thin-walled, 1‚Äì2¬†¬µm wide, and provided with )Tj
T*(clamps which may be dilated.[18] )Tj
T*( The spores in mass are dark brown when mature. They are spherical, covered )Tj
T*(with "warts" or verrucae, and measure 5‚Äì6¬†¬µm in diameter \(including )Tj
T*(ornamentation\).[nb 2] The spores often contain a drop of oil. Scanning electron )Tj
T*(microscopy reveals the verrucae to be up to 0.8¬†¬µm long, conical to columnar )Tj
T*(processes with rounded to almost flattened tips. The apiculus \(the part of a )Tj
T*(spore which attaches to the sterigmata at the end of a basidium\) is distinct )Tj

T*( The capillitium refers to coarse, late-maturing, thick-walled cells in the )Tj

T*(welwitschii in its fruit body morphology, especially the exoperidial rays, )Tj
T*(endoperidial body, and peristome. Geastrum dissimile differs from G.¬†)Tj

T*( [edit] Distribution, ecology, and habitat )Tj
T*( Although Geastrum quadrifidum has a wide distribution, it is not a common )Tj
T*(species. European countries from which the fungus has been reported include )Tj
T*(Belgium,[22][26] Denmark,[27] France,[28] Germany,[29]Montenegro,[30] )Tj
T*(Norway,[31] Poland,[32] and Sweden.[33] In Asia, it has been collected in China )Tj
T*(and Japan.[10] The North American distribution extends from Canada[13] south to )Tj
T*(Mexico,[34] and includes Hawaii.[35] It is also found in Australia[36] and New )Tj
T*(Zealand, South Africa, and South America.[37] Because of its rarity, it has )Tj
T*(been placed on the Regional Red Lists of several European countries, including )Tj
T*(Montenegro,[30] Denmark,[27] Norway,[38] and Poland.[32] )Tj
T*( Like most earthstars, G.¬†quadrifidum is a saprobic fungus, and spends most of )Tj
T*(its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing )Tj
T*(leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing )Tj
T*(organic matter in the soil.[39] The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in )Tj
T*(coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was )Tj
T*(found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer.[34] In )Tj
T*(Britain, all collections have been made in beech forest on calcareous soil.[26] )Tj

T*( After graduating from the University of Kentucky, Collins worked as a school )Tj
T*(teacher while her husband finished a degree in dentistry. She became interested )Tj
T*(in politics, and worked on both Wendell Ford's gubernatorial campaign in 1971 )Tj
T*(and Walter "Dee" Huddleston's U.S. Senate campaign in 1972. In 1975, she was )Tj
T*(chosen secretary of the state's Democratic Party and was elected clerk of the )Tj
T*(Kentucky Court of Appeals. During her tenure as clerk, a constitutional )Tj
T*(amendment restructured the state's judicial system, and the Court of Appeals )Tj
T*(became the Kentucky Supreme Court; Collins continued as clerk of the renamed )Tj
T*(court and worked to educate citizens about the court's new role. )Tj
T*( Collins was elected lieutenant governor in 1979, under Governor John Y. Brown, )Tj
T*(Jr. Brown was frequently out of the state, leaving Collins as acting governor )Tj
T*(for more than 500 days of her four-year term. In 1983, she defeated Republican )Tj
T*(Jim Bunning to become Kentucky's first woman governor. Her administration had )Tj
T*(two primary focuses: education and economic development. After failing to )Tj
T*(secure increased funding for education in the 1984 legislative session, she )Tj
T*(conducted a statewide public awareness campaign in advance of a special )Tj
T*(legislative session the following year; the modified program was passed in that )Tj
T*(session. She successfully used economic incentives to bring a Toyota )Tj
T*(manufacturing plant to Georgetown, Kentucky in 1986. Legal challenges to the )Tj
T*(incentives¬†‚Äì which would have cost the state the plant and its related economic )Tj
T*(benefits¬†‚Äì were eventually dismissed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. The state )Tj
T*(experienced record economic growth under Collins' leadership. )Tj
T*( At the time, Kentucky governors were not eligible for reelection. Collins )Tj
T*(taught at several universities after her four-year term as governor. From 1990 )Tj
T*(to 1996, she was the president of Saint Catharine College near Springfield, )Tj
T*(Kentucky. The 1993 conviction of Collins' husband, Dr. Bill Collins, in an )Tj
T*(influence-peddling scandal damaged her hopes for a return to political life. )Tj
T*(Prior to her husband's conviction it had been rumored that she would be a )Tj
T*(candidate for the U.S. Senate, or would take a position in the administration )Tj
T*(of President Bill Clinton. As of 2012 Collins is an executive scholar in )Tj
T*(residence at Georgetown College. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Martha Layne Hall was born December 7, 1936, in Bagdad, Kentucky,[1] the only )Tj
T*(child of Everett and Mary \(Taylor\) Hall.[2] When Martha was in the sixth grade, )Tj
T*(her family moved to Shelbyville, Kentucky, and opened the Hall-Taylor Funeral )Tj
T*(Home.[2] Martha was involved in numerous extracurricular activities both in )Tj
T*(school and at the local Baptist church.[2] Her parents were active in local )Tj
T*(politics, working for the campaigns of several Democratic candidates, and Hall )Tj
T*(frequently joined them, stuffing envelopes and delivering pamphlets )Tj
T*(door-to-door.[3] )Tj
T*( Martha attended Shelbyville High School where she was a good student and a )Tj
T*(cheerleader.[4] She frequently competed in beauty pageants and won the title of )Tj
T*(Shelby County Tobacco Festival Queen in 1954.[4] After high school, she )Tj
T*(enrolled at Lindenwood College, an all-woman college in Saint Charles, )Tj
T*(Missouri.[5][4] After one year at Lindenwood, she transferred to the University )Tj

T*(the couple had two children, Steve and Marla.[5] )Tj
T*( In 1966, the Collinses moved to Versailles, Kentucky, where Martha taught at )Tj
T*(Woodford County Junior High School.[3] The couple became active in several )Tj
T*(civic organizations, including the Jaycees and Jayceettes and the Young )Tj
T*(Democratic Couples Club.[4] Through the club, they worked on behalf of Henry )Tj
T*(Ward's unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 1967.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early political career )Tj
T*( By 1971, Collins was the president of the Jayceettes, and it was through that )Tj
T*(organization that she came to the attention of Democratic state senator Walter )Tj
T*("Dee" Huddleston.[4] Huddleston asked Collins to co-chair Wendell Ford's )Tj
T*(gubernatorial campaign in the 6th District.[4] J.R. Miller, then-chairman of )Tj
T*(the state Democratic Party, commented that "She organized that district like )Tj
T*(you wouldn't believe."[3] After Ford's victory, he named her Democratic )Tj
T*(National Committeewoman from Kentucky.[1] She quit her teaching job and went to )Tj
T*(work full-time at the state Democratic Party headquarters, as secretary of the )Tj
T*(state Democratic party and as a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National )Tj
T*(Convention.[3][6] The following year, she worked for Huddleston's campaign for )Tj
T*(the U.S. Senate.[1] )Tj
T*( In 1975, Collins won the Democratic nomination for clerk of the Kentucky Court )Tj
T*(of Appeals in a five-way primary.[3] In the general election, she defeated )Tj
T*(Republican Joseph E. Lambert by a vote of 382,528 to 233,442.[5] During her )Tj
T*(term, an amendment to the state constitution changed the name of the Court of )Tj
T*(Appeals to the Kentucky Supreme Court; Collins thus became the last person to )Tj
T*(hold the office of clerk of the Court of Appeals and the first to hold the )Tj
T*(office of clerk of the Supreme Court. As clerk, she compiled and distributed a )Tj
T*(brochure about the new role of the Supreme Court, and worked with the state )Tj
T*(department of education to create a teacher's manual for use in the public )Tj
T*(schools, detailing the changes effected in the court system as a result of the )Tj
T*(constitutional amendment. The Woodford County chapter of Business and )Tj
T*(Professional Women chose Collins as its 1976 Woman of Achievement, and in 1977, )Tj
T*(Governor Julian Carroll named her Kentucky Executive Director of the Friendship )Tj
T*(Force.[1] )Tj
T*( In a field that included six major candidates, Collins secured the Democratic )Tj
T*(nomination for lieutenant governor in 1979, garnering 23 percent of the )Tj
T*(vote.[5] She defeated Republican Hal Rogers in the general election 543,176 to )Tj
T*(316,798.[5] As lieutenant governor, she traveled the state, attending )Tj
T*(ceremonies in place of Democratic Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., who disliked )Tj
T*(such formal events and often chose not to attend.[7] By the end of her term, )Tj
T*(she declared that she had visited all 120 counties in Kentucky.[7] Governor )Tj
T*(Brown was frequently out of the state, leaving Collins as acting governor for )Tj
T*(more than 500 days of her four-year term.[8] )Tj
T*( As lieutenant governor, Collins was responsible for presiding over the state )Tj
T*(Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and )Tj
T*(knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role.[3] She was twice called upon )Tj
T*(to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers )Tj
T*(to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch )Tj
T*(banking across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in )Tj
T*(the negative, killing the bill.[3] During her tenure, she also chaired the )Tj
T*(National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming the first woman to hold )Tj
T*(that position.[7] In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the )Tj

T*( Nearing the end of her term as lieutenant governor, Collins announced her )Tj
T*(intent to run for governor in 1983.[5] Her opponents for the Democratic )Tj
T*(nomination included Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane and Grady Stumbo, the former )Tj
T*(secretary of the state's Department of Human Resources.[3] Collins had the )Tj
T*(support of many leaders in the Democratic Party, but just before the primary, )Tj

T*(during his term.[5][10] With 223,692 votes, Collins edged out Sloane \(219,160 )Tj
T*(votes\) and Stumbo \(199,795 votes\) to secure the nomination.[5] Sloane asked for )Tj
T*(a recanvass of the ballots, but ultimately decided it would not change the )Tj
T*(outcome and conceded defeat.[11] )Tj
T*( In the general election, Collins faced Republican state senator and future )Tj
T*(Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Bunning.[5] The National Organization for )Tj
T*(Women, the National Women's Campaign Fund, and the Women's Political Caucus all )Tj
T*(refused to endorse Collins, citing her lukewarm support for the Equal Rights )Tj
T*(Amendment and her opposition to abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or )Tj
T*(when the mother's life was in danger.[12] Bunning was not personable on the )Tj
T*(campaign trail and had difficulty finding issues that would draw traditionally )Tj
T*(Democratic voters to him.[13] His Catholicism was also a political )Tj
T*(liability.[13] Collins won the election by a vote of 561,674 to 454,650, )Tj
T*(becoming the first, and to date only, woman to be elected governor of )Tj
T*(Kentucky.[1][5] )Tj
T*( Following her election, Collins donated the surplus $242,000 from her campaign )Tj
T*(coffers to the state Democratic party. When Collins' husband was named state )Tj
T*(treasurer for the party¬†‚Äì at an annual salary of $59,900¬†‚Äì the state press )Tj
T*(charged that the move was a plot to funnel Collins' campaign funds into her )Tj
T*(personal account. \(The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no )Tj
T*(salary during his tenure.\) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned )Tj
T*(his post as treasurer; all of the involved individuals insisted that Governor )Tj
T*(Collins had not been briefed on the details of her husband's appointment. The )Tj
T*(media's criticism of Collins continued as many of the appointments to her )Tj
T*(executive cabinet went to inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in )Tj
T*(her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty )Tj
T*(approved a 17% rate increase requested by Blue Cross Blue Shield¬†‚Äì a request )Tj
T*(that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier¬†‚Äì Collins quickly )Tj
T*(countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Governor )Tj
T*( In her first address to the legislature, Collins asked for an additional $324¬†)Tj
T*(million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for )Tj
T*(education.[5] The additional revenue was to be derived from Collins' proposed )Tj
T*(tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making )Tj
T*(more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as )Tj
T*(auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax.[15] )Tj
T*(After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 )Tj
T*(biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package, retaining the )Tj
T*(corporate licensing tax increase, but replacing the sales tax and income tax )Tj
T*(modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the )Tj
T*(deductions for depreciation that corporations could claim on their state )Tj
T*(taxes.[16] With the state still recovering from an economic recession and an )Tj
T*(election year upcoming, legislators refused to raise taxes, and Collins )Tj
T*(eventually withdrew her request and submitted a continuation budget instead.[5] )Tj
T*(Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory )Tj
T*(kindergarten, remedial programs for elementary school children, mandatory )Tj
T*(testing and internship for teachers, and the implementation of academic )Tj
T*(receivership for underperforming schools.[17] Among the other accomplishments )Tj
T*(of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher drunk driving law and )Tj
T*(a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the )Tj
T*(state.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Consideration for vice-president )Tj
T*( By virtue of her election as Kentucky's governor, Collins became the )Tj
T*(highest-ranking Democratic woman in the nation.[18] The only two women in the )Tj
T*(U.S. Senate at the time were Republicans, and Collins was the only woman )Tj
T*(governor of any state.[18] Shortly after her election, she appeared on Good )Tj
T*(Morning America, where she was asked about her interest in the vice-presidency )Tj
T*(and gave a non-committal answer.[18] Four days after her inauguration as )Tj

T*(she was again asked if she would be willing to be considered as the Democrats' )Tj
T*(vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming election; she replied "No, not at )Tj
T*(this time."[19] )Tj
T*( In mid-1984, the Democratic National Committee chose Collins to preside over )Tj
T*(the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.[1] This engagement )Tj
T*(prevented Collins from holding the role of chair of the state delegation to the )Tj
T*(convention.[20] That designation was given to Collins' son, Steve.[20] Prior to )Tj
T*(the convention, Walter Mondale, the presumptive presidential nominee, )Tj
T*(interviewed Collins as a possible vice-presidential candidate before choosing )Tj
T*(Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate.[17] A writer for The Miami Herald later )Tj
T*(opined, based on interviews with Mondale advisors, that Collins was never given )Tj
T*(serious consideration by Mondale and that she was included in his list of )Tj
T*(potential running mates primarily to blunt potential charges of "tokenism" in )Tj
T*(considering other women and minorities.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Education proposals )Tj
T*( In January 1985, Collins renewed her push for additional education funding and )Tj
T*(changes by appointing herself secretary of the state Education and Humanities )Tj
T*(Cabinet.[22] Following the announcement, Collins and several key legislators )Tj
T*(held a series of meetings in every county, advocating for her proposed changes )Tj
T*(and seeking information about what types of changes the state's citizens )Tj
T*(desired.[23] At the meetings, Collins was careful to separate the issues of her )Tj
T*(proposed education plan and potential tax increases because she believed the )Tj
T*(issue of taxes had prevented her previous package from being enacted.[23] )Tj
T*( Collins announced a new education package in June 1985 that included a five )Tj
T*(percent across-the-board pay raise for teachers, a reduction in class sizes, )Tj
T*(funding for construction projects, aides for every kindergarten teacher in the )Tj
T*(state, and a "power equalization" program to make funding for poorer school )Tj
T*(districts more equal to that of their more affluent counterparts.[24] After )Tj
T*(favorable reaction to the plan from legislators, she called a special )Tj
T*(legislative session to convene July 8 to consider the plan.[25] After two weeks )Tj
T*(of deliberation, the General Assembly approved Collins' education plan, )Tj
T*(tripling the corporate licensing tax to $2.10 per $1,000 in order to pay for )Tj
T*(the package.[26] The Assembly rejected a proposed five-cents-per-gallon )Tj
T*(increase in the state gasoline tax to finance other spending.[27] )Tj
T*( Collins followed up her success in the 1985 special session with a push for )Tj
T*(more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers )Tj
T*(obliged by approving an additional $100¬†million for higher education in the )Tj
T*(biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program )Tj
T*(and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' )Tj
T*(request for an additional $3.9¬†million to improve the state's vocational )Tj
T*(education system.[28] Legislators approved calling a referendum on a )Tj
T*(constitutional amendment¬†‚Äì supported by Collins¬†‚Äì to make the state )Tj
T*(superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office.[28] )Tj
T*(The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a )Tj
T*(Collins-led campaign in favor of it.[29] The increased corporate tax intended )Tj
T*(to cover the cost of the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. )Tj
T*(In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the state income tax was )Tj
T*(abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who )Tj
T*(would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.[5] )Tj

T*(million in incentives promised to Toyota by Collins and state Commerce )Tj
T*(Secretary Carroll Knicely.[31] They included $35¬†million to buy and improve a )Tj
T*(1,600 acres \(650¬†ha\) tract to be given to Toyota for the plant, $33¬†million for )Tj
T*(initial training of employees, $10¬†million for a skills development center for )Tj
T*(employees, and $47¬†million in highway improvements near the site.[31] The )Tj
T*(incentive package was approved in the 1986 legislative session.[28] State )Tj
T*(Attorney General David L. Armstrong expressed concerns that the incentives )Tj
T*(might conflict with the state constitution by giving gifts from the state )Tj
T*(treasury to a private business, but concluded that the General Assembly had )Tj
T*(made "a good-faith effort to be in compliance with the constitution".[33] )Tj
T*( Given Armstrong's concerns, the administration employed general counsel J. )Tj
T*(Patrick Abell to file a friendly test case to determine the constitutionality )Tj
T*(of the incentive package.[34] While the suit was pending, the Lexington )Tj
T*(Herald-Leader reported that the administration had failed to include the )Tj
T*(interest on the bonds used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the )Tj
T*(cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the Herald-Leader, had already )Tj
T*(pushed the total cost of the package to about $354¬†million by late September )Tj
T*(1986.[35] In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with )Tj
T*(preparing the site for construction.[36] )Tj
T*( Opponents of the economic enticements for Toyota joined the state's test )Tj
T*(suit.[37] In October 1986, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Ray Corns issued )Tj
T*(an initial ruling that the package did not violate the state constitution, but )Tj
T*(both sides asked the Kentucky Supreme Court to make a final decision.[37] On )Tj
T*(June 11, 1987, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled 4‚Äì3 that the package served a )Tj
T*(public purpose and were therefore constitutional.[37] Most of the opposition )Tj
T*(was blunted when Toyota set up several assembly plants across the state; near )Tj
T*(the end of Collins' term, the state Commerce Cabinet reported that 25 )Tj
T*(automotive-related manufacturing plants had been constructed in 17 counties )Tj
T*(since the Toyota announcement.[5][38] )Tj
T*( In 1987, Collins promised $10¬†million in state aid to Ford to incentivize the )Tj
T*(company to expand its truck assembly plant in Louisville.[39] The state )Tj
T*(experienced record job growth under Collins' economic development plan, which )Tj
T*(included attempts to attract both domestic and international companies.[5] The )Tj
T*(state's unemployment rate fell from 9.7 percent in October 1983 to 7.2 percent )Tj
T*(in October 1987; according to the administration's own figures, they created a )Tj
T*(net increase of 73,000 jobs in the state during Collins' tenure.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Other matters during Collins' term )Tj
T*( On October 7, 1987, Collins called a special legislative session to close a )Tj
T*(deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund )Tj
T*(and disbursements.[40] The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers )Tj
T*(with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be )Tj
T*(traced to any single employer.[41] A plan proposed by Democratic state senator )Tj
T*(Ed O'Daniel was expected to provide the framework for legislation considered in )Tj
T*(the session.[40] Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund )Tj
T*(would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for )Tj
T*(30 years.[41] Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on )Tj
T*(other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the Special Fund )Tj
T*(were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; )Tj
T*(consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent )Tj
T*(counties.[41] Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill )Tj
T*(substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the )Tj
T*(legislature and signed by Collins.[41] )Tj
T*( Collins chaired the Tennessee‚ÄìTombigbee Waterway Authority and held that )Tj
T*(position when the waterway opened to the public in 1985.[42] On May 10, 1985, )Tj

T*(University of Louisville, giving guest lectures to students in the university's )Tj
T*(business classes.[43] She also started an international trade consulting firm )Tj
T*(in Lexington.[5][43] When Western Kentucky University president Kern Alexander )Tj
T*(resigned to accept a position at Virginia Tech in 1988, Collins was among four )Tj
T*(finalists to succeed him.[44] Some faculty members publicly expressed concerns )Tj
T*(about Collins' lack of experience in academia, and she withdrew her name from )Tj
T*(consideration shortly before the new president was announced.[44] )Tj
T*( After fulfilling her one-year commitment to the University of Louisville, )Tj
T*(Collins was named a fellow of the Harvard Institute of Politics' John F. )Tj
T*(Kennedy School of Government, teaching non-credit classes on leadership styles )Tj
T*(once a week.[45] Concurrent with her position at Harvard, Collins was named to )Tj
T*(the board of regents for Midway College in 1989; the following year, she was )Tj
T*(removed from the board of regents of Southern Baptist Theological )Tj
T*(Seminary.[9][46] Her removal was automatically triggered after she missed three )Tj
T*(consecutive board meetings between 1986 and 1989.[9] In 1990, Collins accepted )Tj
T*(the presidency of Saint Catharine College in Springfield, Kentucky, becoming )Tj
T*(the first president of the small, Catholic college who was not a Dominican )Tj
T*(nun.[47] College officials stated that Collins was recruited for the presidency )Tj
T*(to raise the college's profile.[47] )Tj
T*( In 1993, Collins' husband, Bill, was charged in an influence-peddling scandal. )Tj
T*(The prosecution claimed that while Collins was governor, Dr. Collins exploited )Tj
T*(a perception that he could influence the awarding of state contracts through )Tj
T*(his wife.[48] It was alleged that he exploited this perception to pressure )Tj
T*(people who did business with the state to invest nearly $2¬†million with )Tj
T*(him.[48] He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; he was )Tj
T*(given a sentence of five years and three months in federal prison, which was at )Tj
T*(the low end of the range prescribed by the federal sentencing guidelines.[49] )Tj
T*(He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved kickbacks )Tj
T*(disguised as political contributions.[48] Governor Collins was called to )Tj
T*(testify in the trial, but was not charged.[50] The scandal tarnished her image, )Tj
T*(however, and may have cost her an appointment in the administration of )Tj
T*(President Bill Clinton.[50] Collins was also rumored to be considering running )Tj
T*(for the U.S. Senate, a bid which never materialized following her husband's )Tj
T*(conviction.[50] The Collinses reunited following Dr. Collins' release from )Tj
T*(prison on October 10, 1997.[51] )Tj
T*( In 1996, Collins resigned as president of Saint Catharine College to direct )Tj
T*(the International Business and Management Center at the University of )Tj
T*(Kentucky.[52] Later that year, she was a co-chair of the Credentials Committee )Tj
T*(at the Democratic National Convention.[53] When her contract with the )Tj
T*(University of Kentucky expired in 1998, Collins took a part-time position as )Tj
T*("executive scholar in residence" at Georgetown College, which allowed her more )Tj

T*(General of Japan in Kentucky, a position which involved promoting Japanese )Tj
T*(interests in Kentucky, encouraging Japanese investment in the state, and )Tj

T*(of investor Floyd Odlum. )Tj
T*( RKO has long been celebrated for its cycle of musicals starring Fred Astaire )Tj
T*(and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, )Tj
T*(later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. Cary Grant )Tj
T*(was a mainstay for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror )Tj
T*(unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been )Tj
T*(acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio )Tj
T*(produced two of the most famous films in motion picture history: King Kong and )Tj
T*(Citizen Kane. )Tj
T*( Maverick industrialist Howard Hughes took over RKO in 1948. After years of )Tj
T*(decline under his control, the studio was acquired by the General Tire and )Tj
T*(Rubber Company in 1955. The original RKO Pictures ceased production in 1957 and )Tj
T*(was effectively dissolved two years later. In 1981, broadcaster RKO General, )Tj
T*(the corporate heir, revived it as a production subsidiary, RKO Pictures Inc. In )Tj
T*(1989, this business with its few remaining assets, the trademarks and remake )Tj
T*(rights to many classic RKO films, was sold to new owners, who now operate the )Tj
T*(small independent company RKO Pictures LLC. )Tj
T*( [edit] Origin of company )Tj
T*( In October 1927, Warner Bros. released The Jazz Singer, the first )Tj
T*(feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted Hollywood to convert from )Tj
T*(silent to sound film production en masse. The Radio Corporation of America )Tj
T*(\(RCA\) controlled an advanced optical sound-on-film system, RCA Photophone, )Tj
T*(recently developed by General Electric. However, its hopes of joining in the )Tj
T*(anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and Fox, )Tj
T*(Hollywood's other vanguard sound studio, were already financially and )Tj
T*(technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of AT&amp;T's Western Electric )Tj
T*(division. The industry's two largest companies, Paramount and Loew's/MGM, with )Tj
T*(two other major studios, Universal and First National, were poised to contract )Tj
T*(with ERPI for sound conversion as well.[1] )Tj
T*( Seeking a customer for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then general )Tj
T*(manager of RCA, approached Joseph Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's )Tj
T*(modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America \(FBO\). Negotiations )Tj
T*(resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO‚ÄîSarnoff )Tj
T*(had apparently already conceived of a plan for the company to attain a central )Tj
T*(position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the )Tj
T*(agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading )Tj
T*(Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the )Tj
T*(possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum )Tj
T*(\(KAO\) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live )Tj
T*(vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the )Tj
T*(filmmaking operations of Path√© \(U.S.\) and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers )Tj
T*(Distributing Corporation had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO )Tj
T*(general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Path√©, )Tj
T*(turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's )Tj
T*(company, Producers Distributing Corporation \(PDC\). This was the relationship )Tj
T*(Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.[2][3][b] )Tj
T*( After an aborted attempt by Kennedy to bring yet another studio that had )Tj
T*(turned to him for help, First National, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready )Tj
T*(to step back in: the company acquired Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO )Tj
T*(theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced the creation of the )Tj
T*(Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. )Tj
T*(Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, )Tj
T*(kept Path√© separate from RKO and under his personal control.[2][4] RCA owned )Tj
T*(the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's )Tj
T*(share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent.[5] The company's )Tj
T*(production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president )Tj
T*(Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures.[6] )Tj
T*(Looking to get out of the film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in )Tj

T*( [edit] Golden Age studio )Tj
T*( [edit] Early years )Tj
T*( Declaring that it would make only all-talking films, RKO began shooting at the )Tj
T*(small facility FBO shared with Path√© in New York City while the main FBO studio )Tj
T*(in Hollywood was technologically refitted. In charge of production was William )Tj
T*(LeBaron, who had held the same position at FBO. The new company's two initial )Tj
T*(releases were musicals: The melodramatic Syncopation premiered on March 29, )Tj
T*(1929.[8] The comedic Street Girl debuted July 30. This was billed as RKO's )Tj
T*(first "official" production‚Äîfirst to follow the formal incorporation of Radio )Tj
T*(Pictures, first to be made in Hollywood.[9][c] A few nonsinging pictures )Tj
T*(followed, but the studio's first major hit was again a musical. RKO spent )Tj
T*(heavily on the lavish Rio Rita, including a number of Technicolor sequences. )Tj
T*(Opening in September to rave reviews, it was named one of the ten best pictures )Tj
T*(of the year by Film Daily.[10] Cinema historian Richard Barrios credits it with )Tj
T*(initiating the "first age of the filmed Broadway musical".[11] By the end of )Tj
T*(the year, RKO was making use of an additional production facility‚Äîfive hundred )Tj
T*(acres had been acquired near Encino in the San Fernando Valley as a backlot for )Tj
T*(exteriors and large-scale standing sets.[12] )Tj
T*( RKO released a limited slate of twelve features in its first year; in 1930, )Tj
T*(that figure more than doubled to twenty-nine.[13] Originally organized as the )Tj
T*(distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by )Tj
T*(July the studio was making a transition to the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures )Tj
T*(Inc.[14] Encouraged by Rio Rita's success, RKO produced several costly musicals )Tj
T*(incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck, both )Tj
T*(scripted and directed, like Rio Rita, by Luther Reed.[15] Following the example )Tj
T*(of the other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical revue, )Tj
T*(Radio Revels. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it )Tj
T*(was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor.[16] The project was abandoned, )Tj
T*(however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total )Tj
T*(of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following )Tj
T*(year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931.[17] RKO was left in a bind: it )Tj
T*(still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its )Tj
T*(system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the )Tj
T*(momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from )Tj
T*(the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two )Tj
T*(all-Technicolor pictures, The Runaround and Fanny Foley Herself \(both 1931\), )Tj
T*(containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.[18] )Tj
T*( Even as the U.S. economy foundered, RKO had gone on a spending spree, buying )Tj
T*(up theater after theater to add to its exhibition chain. In October 1930, the )Tj
T*(company purchased a 50 percent stake in the New York's Van Beuren studio, which )Tj
T*(specialized in cartoons and live shorts.[19] RKO's production schedule soon )Tj
T*(surpassed forty features a year, released under the names "Radio Pictures" and, )Tj
T*(for a short time after the 1931 merger, "RKO Path√©". Cimarron \(1931\), produced )Tj
T*(by LeBaron himself, would become the only RKO production to win the Academy )Tj
T*(Award for Best Picture; nonetheless, having cost a profligate $1.4 million to )Tj
T*(make, it was a money-loser on original domestic release.[20][d] The most )Tj
T*(popular RKO star of this pre-Code era was Irene Dunne, who made her debut as )Tj
T*(the lead in the 1930 musical Leathernecking and was a headliner at the studio )Tj
T*(for the entire decade.[21] Other major performers included Joel McCrea, Ricardo )Tj
T*(Cortez, Dolores del R√≠o, and Mary Astor. Richard Dix, Oscar-nominated for his )Tj
T*(lead performance in Cimarron, would serve as RKO's standby B-movie star until )Tj
T*(the early 1940s.[22] The comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey, often )Tj
T*(wrangling over ingenue Dorothy Lee, was a bankable mainstay for )Tj
T*(years.[23]Constance Bennett, Ann Harding, and Helen Twelvetrees came over with )Tj
T*(Path√©.[24] The Path√© acquisition, though a defensible investment in the long )Tj
T*(term for its physical facilities, was yet another major expense borne by the )Tj
T*(fledgling RKO, particularly as Path√©'s stock price had been artificially )Tj

T*(production unit.[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] Success under Selznick )Tj
T*( Exceptions like Cimarron and Rio Rita aside, RKO's product was largely )Tj
T*(regarded as mediocre, so in October, 1931, twenty-nine-year-old David O. )Tj
T*(Selznick visited Sarnoff in New York and convinced him to replace LeBaron as )Tj
T*(production chief.[27] As the new studio chief Selznick implemented rigorous )Tj
T*(cost-control measures, championed the unit production system, which gave the )Tj
T*(producers of individual movies much greater independence than they had under )Tj
T*(the prevailing central producer system. "Under the factory system of production )Tj
T*(you rob the director of his individualism", said Selznick, "and this being a )Tj
T*(creative industry that is harmful to the quality of the product made" \(even )Tj
T*(though Selznick earned a sour reputation for meddling in director output\).[28] )Tj
T*(Instituting unit production, he predicted, would also result in cost savings of )Tj
T*(30‚Äì40 percent.[28] To make films under the new system, Selznick recruited prize )Tj
T*(behind-the-camera personnel, such as director George Cukor and )Tj
T*(producer/director Merian C. Cooper, and gave producer Pandro S. Berman, aged )Tj
T*(twenty-six, increasingly important projects.[29] Selznick discovered and signed )Tj
T*(a young actress who would become a star created by RKO, Katharine Hepburn. Also )Tj
T*(enlisted was established star John Barrymore for a few memorable )Tj
T*(performances.[30] From September 1932 on, print advertising for the company's )Tj
T*(features displayed the revised name "RKO Radio Pictures"; the Path√© name was )Tj
T*(used only for newsreels and documentaries.[e] That same year, the New York )Tj
T*(City‚Äìbased corporate headquarters moved into the new RKO Building, an Art Deco )Tj
T*(skyscraper rising high above RKO controlled Radio City Music Hall that was one )Tj
T*(of the first Rockefeller Center structures to open.[31] )Tj
T*( Selznick worked fifteen months as RKO production chief before resigning over a )Tj
T*(dispute with new corporate president Merlin Aylesworth, and then moved up to )Tj
T*(MGM to work for his powerful father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer.[32] One of his last )Tj
T*(acts at RKO was to approve a screen test for a thirty-three-year-old, balding )Tj
T*(Broadway song-and-dance man named Fred Astaire.[33] In a memo, Selznick wrote, )Tj
T*("I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is ... )Tj
T*(tremendous".[34] Selznick's tenure was widely considered a success: In 1931, )Tj
T*(before he arrived, the studio had produced forty-two features for $16 million )Tj
T*(in total budgets \(an average cost of $380,00 per picture\). In 1932, under )Tj
T*(Selznick, forty-one features were made for only $10.2 million \(an average )Tj
T*(budget of $268,000 per feature\), yet with improvement in polish and )Tj
T*(popularity.[35] He backed several major successes, including A Bill of )Tj
T*(Divorcement \(1932\), with Cukor directing Hepburn's debut, and the monumental )Tj
T*(King Kong \(1933\)‚Äîlargely Merian Cooper's brainchild, brought to life by the )Tj
T*(astonishing special effects work of Willis O'Brien.[36] Still, shaky finances )Tj
T*(and excesses that marked the company's pre-Selznick days had not left RKO in )Tj
T*(good enough shape to withstand the Depression; the movie studio sank into )Tj
T*(receivership in early 1933, from which it did not emerge until 1940.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cooper at the helm )Tj
T*( Cooper took over as production head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two )Tj
T*(hits starring Hepburn: Morning Glory \(1933\), for which she won her first Oscar, )Tj
T*(and Little Women \(1933\), director Cukor's second collaboration with the )Tj
T*(actress.[39] Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the )Tj
T*(biggest box-office success of the decade.[40]Ginger Rogers had already made )Tj
T*(several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and )Tj
T*(cast her in the big-budget musical Flying Down to Rio \(1933\).[41] Rogers was )Tj
T*(paired with Astaire, making his movie debut. Billed fourth and fifth )Tj
T*(respectively, the picture turned them into stars.[42]Hermes Pan, assistant to )Tj
T*(the film's dance director, would become one of Hollywood's leading )Tj
T*(choreographers through his subsequent work with Astaire.[43][44] )Tj
T*( Along with Columbia Pictures, RKO became one of the primary homes of the )Tj
T*(screwball comedy. As film historian James Harvey describes, compared to their )Tj

T*(all the preeminent screwball directors did their important films‚Äî[Howard] Hawks )Tj
T*(and [Gregory] La Cava and [Leo] McCarey and [George] Stevens."[45] The )Tj
T*(relatively unheralded William A. Seiter directed the studio's first significant )Tj
T*(contribution to the genre, The Richest Girl in the World \(1934\).[46] The drama )Tj
T*(Of Human Bondage \(1934\), directed by John Cromwell, was Bette Davis's first )Tj
T*(great success.[47] Stevens's Alice Adams and director John Ford's The Informer )Tj
T*(were each nominated for the 1935 Best Picture Oscar‚Äîthe Best Director statuette )Tj
T*(won by Ford was the only one ever given for an RKO production.[48]The )Tj
T*(Informer's star, Victor McLaglen, also took home an Academy Award; he would )Tj
T*(appear in a dozen movies for the studio over a span of two decades.[49] )Tj
T*( Lacking the financial resources of industry leaders MGM, Paramount, and Fox, )Tj
T*(RKO turned out many pictures during the era that made up for it with high style )Tj
T*(in an Art Deco mode, exemplified by such Astaire‚ÄìRogers musicals as The Gay )Tj
T*(Divorcee \(1934\), their first pairing as leads, and Top Hat \(1935\).[50] One of )Tj
T*(the figures most responsible for this was creative Van Nest Polglase, chief of )Tj
T*(RKO's highly regarded design department for almost a decade.[51][52] Film )Tj
T*(historian James Naremore has described RKO as "chiefly a designer's studio. It )Tj
T*(never had a stable of important actors, writers, or directors, but ... it was )Tj
T*(rich in artists and special-effects technicians. As a result its most )Tj
T*(distinctive pictures contained a strong element of fantasy‚Äînot so much the )Tj
T*(fantasy of horror, which during the thirties was the province of Universal, but )Tj
T*(the fantasy of the marvelous and adventurous."[53] )Tj
T*( As a group, the studio's craft divisions were among the strongest in the )Tj
T*(industry.[51][54]Costumer Walter Plunkett, who worked with the company from the )Tj
T*(close of the FBO era through the end of 1939, was known as the top period )Tj
T*(wardrobist in the business.[55] Sidney Saunders, innovative head of the )Tj
T*(studio's paint department, was responsible for significant progress in rear )Tj
T*(projection quality.[56] On June 13, 1935, RKO premiered the first feature film )Tj
T*(shot entirely in advanced three-strip Technicolor, Becky Sharp. The movie was )Tj
T*(coproduced with Pioneer Pictures, founded by Cooper‚Äîwho departed RKO after two )Tj
T*(years helming production‚Äîand John Hay "Jock" Whitney, who brought in his cousin )Tj
T*(Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney; Cooper had successfully encouraged the Whitneys )Tj
T*(to purchase a major share of the Technicolor business as well.[57] Though )Tj
T*(judged by critics a failure as drama, Becky Sharp was widely lauded for its )Tj
T*(visual brilliance and technical expertise.[58] RKO also employed some of the )Tj
T*(industry's leading artists and craftsmen whose work was never seen. From the )Tj
T*(studio's earliest days through late 1935, Max Steiner, regarded by many )Tj
T*(historians as the most influential composer of the early years of sound cinema, )Tj
T*(made music for over 100 RKO films.[44][59]Murray Spivack, head of the studio's )Tj
T*(audio special effects department, made important advances in the use of )Tj
T*(rerecording technology first heard in King Kong.[60] )Tj
T*( [edit] Briskin and Berman )Tj
T*( In October 1935 the ownership team expanded, with financier Floyd Odlum )Tj
T*(leading a syndicate that bought 50 percent of RCA's stake in the company; the )Tj
T*(Rockefeller brothers, also major stockholders, increasingly became involved in )Tj
T*(the business.[61] While RKO made a concerted effort to promote Katharine )Tj
T*(Hepburn's career, her box office record while at the studio was checkered. )Tj
T*(Barbara Stanwyck joined the studio's roster‚Äîthough Stanwyck would have little )Tj
T*(success during her few years there while Ann Sothern enjoyed a career boost. )Tj
T*(Between 1935 and 1937 Miss Sothern was paired five time with Gene Raymond out )Tj
T*(of her seven RKO films.[62] Then, in 1939 MGM finally found a replacement for )Tj
T*(the deceased Jean Harlow when they hired Sothern. Cary Grant regularly appeared )Tj
T*(in RKO films for some years, but was one of the first leading men of the sound )Tj

T*(slogan, "Quality Pictures at a Premium Price", was keen on signing up )Tj
T*(independent producers whose films RKO would distribute.[79] In 1941, the studio )Tj
T*(landed one of the most prestigious independents in Hollywood when it arranged )Tj
T*(to handle Samuel Goldwyn's productions. The first two Goldwyn pictures released )Tj
T*(by the studio were highly successful: The Little Foxes, directed by William )Tj
T*(Wyler and starring Bette Davis, garnered four Oscar nominations,[80] while the )Tj
T*(Howard Hawks‚Äìdirected Ball of Fire at last brought Barbara Stanwyck a hit under )Tj

T*(critically lauded and overbudget‚Äîand the expensive embarrassment of his aborted )Tj
T*(documentary It's All True.[83] The three Mercury productions combined to drain )Tj
T*($2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had )Tj
T*(reported an overall deficit of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit )Tj
T*(more than $500,000 in 1941.[i] Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious )Tj
T*(pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive )Tj
T*(deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her )Tj
T*(performance in the previous year's Kitty Foyle, held out for a freelance )Tj
T*(contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in just one more RKO )Tj
T*(production, thirteen years later.[84] On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his )Tj
T*(resignation.[85] He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO was about )Tj
T*(to turn the corner. Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided )Tj
T*(by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next )Tj
T*(half-decade.[86] )Tj
T*( [edit] Rebound under Koerner )Tj
T*( By the end of June 1942, Floyd Odlum had taken over a controlling interest in )Tj
T*(the company via his Atlas Corporation, edging aside the Rockefellers and )Tj
T*(Sarnoff. Charles Koerner, former head of the RKO theater chain and allied with )Tj
T*(Odlum, had assumed the title of production chief some time prior to Schaefer's )Tj
T*(departure.[87] With Schaefer gone, Koerner could actually do the job; )Tj
T*(announcing a policy of "entertainment, not genius" \(a snipe at Schaefer's )Tj
T*(artistic ambitions in general and his sponsorship of Welles in particular\),[88] )Tj
T*(he brought the studio much-needed stability until his death in February )Tj
T*(1946.[86][89] The change in RKO's fortunes was virtually immediate: corporate )Tj
T*(profits rose from $736,241 in 1942 \(the theatrical division compensating for )Tj
T*(the studio's $2.34 million deficit\) to $6.96 million the following year.[90] )Tj
T*(The Rockefellers sold off their stock and, early in 1943, RCA dispensed with )Tj
T*(the last of its holdings in the company as well, cutting David Sarnoff's ties )Tj
T*(to the studio that was largely his conception.[91] In June 1944, RKO created a )Tj
T*(television production subsidiary, RKO Television Corporation, to provide )Tj
T*(content for the new medium. RKO became the first major studio to produce for )Tj
T*(television with Talk Fast, Mister, a one-hour drama filmed at RKO-Path√© studios )Tj
T*(in New York and broadcast by the DuMont network's New York station, WABD, on )Tj
T*(December 18, 1944. In collaboration with Mexican businessman Emilio Azc√°rraga )Tj
T*(Vidaurreta, RKO established Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City in 1945.[92] )Tj
T*( With RKO on increasingly secure ground, Koerner sought to increase its output )Tj
T*(of handsomely budgeted, star-driven features. However, the studio's only )Tj
T*(remaining major stars under anything like extended contracts were Grant, whose )Tj
T*(services were shared with Columbia Pictures, and O'Hara, shared with Twentieth )Tj
T*(Century-Fox.[94][95] Lacking in-house stars, Koerner and his successors under )Tj
T*(Odlum arranged with the other studios to loan out their biggest names or signed )Tj
T*(one of the growing number of freelance performers to short-term, "pay or play" )Tj
T*(deals. Thus RKO pictures of the mid- and late forties offered Bing Crosby, )Tj
T*(Henry Fonda, and others who were out of the studio's price range for extended )Tj
T*(contracts.[96]John Wayne appeared in 1943's A Lady Takes a Chance while on loan )Tj
T*(from Republic Pictures; he was soon working regularly with RKO, making nine )Tj
T*(more movies for the studio.[97]Gary Cooper appeared in RKO releases produced by )Tj
T*(Goldwyn and, later, the startup International Pictures,[98] and Claudette )Tj
T*(Colbert starred in a number of RKO coproductions.[99]Ingrid Bergman appeared )Tj
T*(under a variety of hats: on loan out from Selznick in The Bells of St. Mary's )Tj

T*(was similarly profitable.[40][105] )Tj
T*( [edit] Focus on B movies )Tj
T*( Much more than the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B pictures to fill up )Tj
T*(its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, )Tj
T*(ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 )Tj
T*(range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features )Tj
T*(put out by the other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million )Tj
T*(dollars.[106] A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while )Tj
T*(it also limited the potential for reward \(Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside\), )Tj
T*(RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and )Tj
T*(low-cost product than with its A movies.[5] The studio's low-budget films )Tj
T*(offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Mark )Tj
T*(Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann.[107][108] Robson and Wise received their )Tj
T*(first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B )Tj

T*(their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film )Tj

T*(were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO.[113] The Falcon )Tj
T*(was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. )Tj
T*(He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom )Tj
T*(Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. )Tj

T*( [edit] HUAC and Howard Hughes )Tj
T*( RKO, and the movie industry as a whole, had its most profitable year ever in )Tj
T*(1946. A Goldwyn production released by RKO, The Best Years of Our Lives, was )Tj
T*(the most successful Hollywood film of the decade.[124] But the legal status of )Tj
T*(the industry's reigning business model was increasingly being called into )Tj
T*(doubt: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v. RKO that the company was )Tj
T*(liable for damages under antitrust statutes for having denied an independent )Tj
T*(movie house access to first run films‚Äîa common practice among all of the Big )Tj
T*(Five.[125] With profits at a high point, Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off )Tj
T*(about 40 percent of his shares in the company to a group of investment )Tj
T*(firms.[126] After Koerner's death, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N. Peter )Tj
T*(Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions, )Tj
T*(with Depinet moving to the corporate offices in New York and Rathvon relocating )Tj
T*(to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was )Tj
T*(sought for Koerner. On the first day of 1947, producer and Oscar-winning )Tj
T*(screenwriter Dore Schary, who had been working at the studio on loan from )Tj
T*(Selznick, took over the role.[127] )Tj
T*( RKO appeared in good shape to build on its recent successes, but the year )Tj
T*(brought a number of unpleasant harbingers for all of Hollywood. The British )Tj
T*(government imposed a 75 percent tax on films produced abroad; along with )Tj
T*(similarly confiscatory taxes and quota laws enacted by other countries, this )Tj
T*(led to a sharp decline in foreign revenues.[128][129] The postwar attendance )Tj
T*(boom peaked sooner than expected and television emerged as a competitor for )Tj
T*(audience interest. Across the board, profits fell‚Äîa 27 percent drop for the )Tj
T*(Hollywood studios from 1946 to 1947.[130] The phenomenon that would become )Tj
T*(known as McCarthyism was building strength, and in October, the House )Tj
T*(Un-American Activities Committee \(HUAC\) began hearings into Communism in the )Tj
T*(motion picture industry. Two of RKO's top talents, Dmytryk and producer Adrian )Tj
T*(Scott, refused to cooperate. As a consequence, they were fired by RKO per the )Tj
T*(terms of the Waldorf Statement, the major studios' pledge to "eliminate any )Tj
T*(subversives". Scott, Dmytryk, and eight others who also defied HUAC‚Äîdubbed the )Tj
T*(Hollywood Ten‚Äîwere blacklisted across the industry.[131] Ironically, the )Tj
T*(studio's major success of the year was Crossfire, a Scott‚ÄìDmytryk film.[132] )Tj
T*(Odlum concluded it was time to exit the film business, and he put his remaining )Tj
T*(RKO shares‚Äîapproximately 25 percent of the outstanding stock‚Äîon the )Tj
T*(market.[133] Before the turn of the year, the Path√©-branded newsreel was sold )Tj
T*(to Warner Bros.[129] For her performance in The Farmer's Daughter \(1947\), a )Tj
T*(coproduction with Selznick's Vanguard Films, Loretta Young won the Best Actress )Tj
T*(Oscar the following March. It would turn out to be the last major Academy Award )Tj
T*(for an RKO picture.[134] )Tj
T*( In May 1948, eccentric aviation tycoon and occasional movie producer Howard )Tj
T*(Hughes gained control of the company, beating out British film magnate J. )Tj
T*(Arthur Rank as the buyer of Odlum's interest.[135] During Hughes's tenure, RKO )Tj
T*(suffered its worst years since the early 1930s, as his capricious management )Tj
T*(style took a heavy toll. Production chief Schary quit almost immediately due to )Tj
T*(his new boss's interference and Rathvon soon followed.[136] Within weeks of )Tj
T*(taking over, Hughes had dismissed three-fourths of the work force; production )Tj
T*(was virtually shut down for six months as the conservative Hughes shelved or )Tj
T*(canceled several of the "message pictures" that Schary had backed. Once )Tj
T*(shooting picked up again, Hughes quickly became notorious for meddling in )Tj
T*(minute production matters, particularly the presentation of actresses he )Tj
T*(favored.[137] All of the Big Five saw their profits dwindle in 1948‚Äîfrom Fox, )Tj
T*(down 11 percent, to Loew's/MGM, down 62 percent‚Äîbut at RKO they virtually )Tj
T*(vanished: from $5.1 million in 1947 to $0.5 million, a drop of 90 percent.[138] )Tj
T*(The production-distribution end of the RKO business, now deep in the red, would )Tj
T*(never make a profit again.[139] )Tj

T*(announcing that his contract was not endangered.[140] Of much broader )Tj
T*(significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by )Tj
T*(being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the )Tj
T*(major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. )Tj
T*(Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the consent decree he signed, Hughes agreed to )Tj
T*(dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's )Tj
T*(production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely )Tj
T*(separate corporations‚ÄîRKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.‚Äîwith the )Tj
T*(obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the )Tj
T*(divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in )Tj
T*(the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce was one )Tj
T*(of the crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's studio )Tj
T*(system.[141] )Tj
T*( [edit] Turmoil under Hughes )Tj
T*( While Hughes's time at RKO was marked by dwindling production and a slew of )Tj
T*(expensive flops, the studio continued to turn out some well-received films )Tj
T*(under production chiefs Sid Rogell and Sam Bischoff, though both became fed up )Tj
T*(with Hughes's meddling and quit after less than two years. \(Bischoff would be )Tj
T*(the last man to hold the job under Hughes.\)[144] There were B noirs such as The )Tj
T*(Window \(1949\), which turned into a hit,[145] and The Set-Up \(1949\), directed by )Tj
T*(Robert Wise and starring Robert Ryan, which won the Critic's Prize at the )Tj
T*(Cannes Film Festival.[146]The Thing from Another World \(1951\), a )Tj
T*(science-fiction drama coproduced with Howard Hawks's Winchester Pictures, is )Tj
T*(seen as a classic of the genre.[147] In 1952, RKO put out two films directed by )Tj
T*(Fritz Lang, Rancho Notorious and Clash by Night. The latter was a project of )Tj
T*(the renowned Jerry Wald‚ÄìNorman Krasna production team, lured by Hughes from )Tj
T*(Warner Bros. with great fanfare in August 1950.[148] )Tj
T*( The company also began a close working relationship with Ida Lupino. She )Tj
T*(starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan‚ÄîNicholas Ray's On Dangerous )Tj
T*(Ground \(1952, though shooting had been completed two years earlier\) and Beware, )Tj
T*(My Lovely \(1952\), a coproduction between RKO and Lupino's company, The )Tj
T*(Filmakers.[149] Of more historic note, Lupino was Hollywood's only female )Tj
T*(director during the period; of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO, )Tj
T*(Lupino directed three, including her now celebrated The Hitch-Hiker )Tj
T*(\(1953\).[150] Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time, RKO )Tj
T*(distributed Akira Kurosawa's epochal Rashomon in the United States, sixteen )Tj
T*(months after its original 1950 Japanese release.[151] The only smash hits )Tj
T*(released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period, but neither was an )Tj
T*(in-house production: Goldwyn's Hans Christian Andersen \(1952\) was followed by )Tj
T*(Disney's Peter Pan \(1953\).[40][152] )Tj
T*( In early 1952, Hughes fought off a lawsuit by screenwriter Paul Jarrico, who )Tj
T*(had been caught up in the latest round of HUAC hearings‚ÄîHughes had fired him )Tj
T*(and removed his name from the credits of a recent release. The studio owner )Tj
T*(subsequently ordered 100 RKO employees on "leave of absence" while he )Tj
T*(established a "security office" to oversee an ideological vetting system. "We )Tj
T*(are going to screen everyone in a creative or executive capacity", he declared. )Tj
T*("The work of Communist sympathizers will not be used."[153] As more credits )Tj
T*(were expunged, some in the industry began to question whether Hughes's hunt for )Tj
T*(subversives served primarily as a convenient rationale for further curtailing )Tj
T*(production and trimming expenses.[154] )Tj
T*( In September, Hughes and his corporate president, Ned E. Depinet, sold their )Tj
T*(RKO studio stock to a Chicago-based syndicate with no experience in the movie )Tj
T*(business; the syndicate's chaotic reign lasted until February 1953, when the )Tj
T*(stock and control were reacquired by Hughes.[155] The studio's net loss in 1952 )Tj
T*(was over $10 million, and shooting had taken place for just a single in-house )Tj
T*(production over the last five months of the year.[156] During the turmoil, )Tj
T*(Samuel Goldwyn ended his 11-year-long distribution deal with RKO. Wald and )Tj

T*(off.[158]Jack Webb's 'DRAGNET' NBC television series was the last project to )Tj
T*(film on the rundown movie ranch for an episode entitled "The Big Producer", )Tj
T*(where the lot played the part of a crumbling "Westside Studios". In November, )Tj
T*(Hughes finally fulfilled his obligations under the 1948 consent decree, )Tj
T*(divesting RKO Theatres; Albert A. List purchased the controlling interest in )Tj
T*(the business and renamed it List Industries.[159] Hughes soon found himself the )Tj
T*(target of no less than five separate lawsuits filed by minority shareholders in )Tj
T*(RKO, accusing him of malfeasance in his dealings with the Chicago group and a )Tj
T*(wide array of acts of mismanagement. "RKO's contract list is down to three )Tj
T*(actors and 127 lawyers", quipped Dick Powell.[160] )Tj
T*( Looking to forestall the impending legal imbroglio, in early 1954 Hughes )Tj
T*(offered to buy out all of RKO's other stockholders. Convinced that the studio )Tj
T*(was sinking, Walt Disney ended his arrangement with RKO and set up his own )Tj
T*(distribution firm, Buena Vista Pictures.[161] By the end of the year, at a cost )Tj
T*(of $23.5 million, Hughes had gained near-total control of RKO Pictures, )Tj
T*(becoming the first virtual sole owner of a studio since Hollywood's pioneer )Tj
T*(days. Virtual, but not quite actual. Floyd Odlum reemerged to block Hughes from )Tj
T*(acquiring the 95 percent ownership of RKO stock he needed to write off the )Tj
T*(company's losses against his earnings elsewhere. Hughes had reneged on his )Tj
T*(promise to give Odlum first option on buying the RKO theater chain when he )Tj
T*(divested it and was now paying the price.[162] With negotiations between the )Tj
T*(two at a stalemate, in July 1955, Hughes turned around and sold RKO pictures to )Tj
T*(the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25 million.[163] For Hughes, this was )Tj
T*(the effective end of a quarter-century's involvement in the movie business. )Tj
T*(Historian Betty Lasky describes Hughes's relationship with RKO as a "systematic )Tj
T*(seven-year rape."[164] )Tj
T*( [edit] General Tire and studio's demise )Tj
T*( In taking control of the studio, General Tire restored RKO's links to )Tj
T*(broadcasting. General Tire had bought the Yankee Network, a New England )Tj
T*(regional radio network, in 1943.[166] In 1950, it purchased the West Coast )Tj
T*(regional Don Lee Broadcasting System,[167] and two years later, the Bamberger )Tj
T*(Broadcasting Service, owner of the WOR TV and radio stations in New York )Tj
T*(City.[168] The latter acquisition gave General Tire majority control of the )Tj
T*(Mutual Broadcasting System, one of America's leading radio networks.[169] )Tj
T*(General Tire then merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, )Tj
T*(General Teleradio.[170] )Tj
T*( Thomas O'Neil, son of General Tire's founder William O'Neil and chairman of )Tj
T*(the broadcasting group, saw that the company's new television stations, indeed )Tj
T*(all TV outlets, were in need of programming. With the purchase of RKO, the )Tj
T*(studio's library was his, and rights to the 742 films to which RKO retained )Tj
T*(clear title were quickly put up for sale. C&amp;C Television Corp., a )Tj

T*( [edit] RKO General )Tj
T*( Main article: RKO General )Tj
T*( One of North America's major radio and television broadcasters from the 1950s )Tj
T*(through the late 1980s, RKO General traces its roots to the 1943 purchase of )Tj
T*(the Yankee Network by General Tire. In 1952, the company united its newly )Tj
T*(expanded broadcasting interests into a division dubbed General Teleradio. With )Tj
T*(the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media )Tj
T*(businesses were brought together under the rubric of RKO Teleradio Pictures. In )Tj
T*(1959, following the breakup of the movie studio, the media division was given )Tj
T*(the name it would operate under for the next three decades, RKO General. In )Tj
T*(addition to its broadcasting activities, RKO General was also the holding )Tj
T*(company for many of General Tire's \(and, after its parent company's )Tj
T*(reorganization, GenCorp's\) other noncore businesses, including soft-drink )Tj
T*(bottling, Musac \(dept. store and elevator piped-in\) music, Video Independent )Tj
T*(Theatre \(135 theatres strong\) Circuit, hotel enterprises, and, for seventeen )Tj
T*(years, the original Frontier Airlines.[185] )Tj
T*( The RKO General radio lineup included some of the highest rated, most )Tj
T*(influential popular music stations in North America. In May 1965, KHJ \(AM\) in )Tj
T*(Los Angeles introduced the Boss Radio variation of the top 40 format. The )Tj
T*(restrictive programming style was soon adopted by many of RKO's other stations )Tj
T*(and imitated by non-RKO broadcasters around the country.[186] RKO's FM station )Tj
T*(in New York pioneered numerous formats under a variety of call letters, )Tj
T*(including WOR and WXLO \("99X"\); in 1983, as WRKS \("98.7 Kiss FM"\), it became )Tj
T*(one of the first major stations to regularly program rap music.[187] In 1979, )Tj

T*( The company's television stations, for the most part non‚Äìnetwork affiliated, )Tj
T*(were known for showing classic films \(both RKO productions and many others\) )Tj
T*(under the banner of Million Dollar Movie, launched by New York's WOR-TV in )Tj
T*(1954.[189] In June 1962, RKO General and Zenith Electronics initiated what )Tj
T*(became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through )Tj
T*(early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's WHCT-TV aired movies, sports, classical and )Tj
T*(pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating )Tj
T*(income from descrambler installation and weekly rental fees as well as )Tj
T*(individual program charges.[190] However, RKO General's most notable legacy is )Tj
T*(what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in )Tj
T*(1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with )Tj
T*(one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two )Tj
T*(decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp \(the parent )Tj
T*(company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General\) to sell off its )Tj
T*(broadcast holdings under FCC pressure. RKO General exited the media business )Tj
T*(permanently in 1991.[185][191] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later incarnations )Tj
T*( Beginning with 1981's Carbon Copy, RKO General became involved in the )Tj
T*(coproduction of a number of feature films and TV projects through a subsidiary )Tj
T*(created three years earlier, RKO Pictures Inc.[192] In collaboration with )Tj
T*(Universal Studios, RKO put out five films over the next three years. Though the )Tj
T*(studio frequently worked with major names‚Äîincluding Burt Reynolds and Dolly )Tj
T*(Parton in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Jack Nicholson in The Border, )Tj
T*(and Nastassja Kinski in Cat People \(all 1982\)‚Äîit met with little success. )Tj
T*(Starting with the Meryl Streep vehicle Plenty \(1985\), RKO took on more projects )Tj
T*(as sole studio backer. Films such as the erotic thriller Half Moon Street )Tj
T*(\(1986\) and the Vietnam War drama Hamburger Hill \(1987\) followed, but production )Tj
T*(ended as GenCorp underwent a massive reorganization following an attempted )Tj
T*(hostile takeover.[185] With RKO General dismantling its broadcast business, RKO )Tj
T*(Pictures Inc., along with the original RKO studio's trademark, remake rights, )Tj
T*(and other remaining assets, was spun off and put up for sale. After a bid by )Tj
T*(RKO Pictures' own managers failed, it was acquired in late 1987 by Wesray )Tj
T*(Capital Corporation‚Äîunder the control of former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury )Tj
T*(William E. Simon and Ray Chambers‚Äîand linked with their Six Flags amusement )Tj
T*(parks to form RKO/Six Flags Entertainment Inc.[193] )Tj
T*( In 1989, RKO Pictures, which had produced no films while under Wesray control, )Tj
T*(was spun off yet again. Actress and Post Cereals heiress Dina Merrill and her )Tj
T*(husband, producer Ted Hartley, acquired a majority interest and merged the )Tj
T*(company with their Pavilion Communications. After a brief period as )Tj
T*(RKO/Pavilion, the business was reorganized as RKO Pictures LLC.[194] With the )Tj
T*(inaugural RKO production under Hartley and Merrill's ownership, False Identity )Tj
T*(\(1990\), the company also stepped into the distribution business. In 1992, it )Tj
T*(handled the well-regarded independent production Laws of Gravity, directed by )Tj
T*(Nick Gomez.[195] RKO's next significant release came in 1998 with Mighty Joe )Tj
T*(Young, a remake of a 1949 RKO movie that was itself something of a King Kong )Tj
T*(redux.[196] In the early 2000s, the company was involved as a coproducer on TV )Tj
T*(movies and modestly budgeted features at the rate of about one annually. In )Tj
T*(2003, RKO coproduced a Broadway stage version of the 1936 Astaire‚ÄìRogers )Tj
T*(vehicle Swing Time, under the title Never Gonna Dance.[197] )Tj
T*( In 2003, as well, RKO Pictures entered into a legal battle with Wall Street )Tj
T*(Financial Associates \(WSFA\). Hartley and Merrill claimed that the owners of )Tj
T*(WSFA fraudulently induced them into signing an acquisition agreement by )Tj
T*(concealing their "cynical and rapacious" plans to purchase RKO with the )Tj
T*(intention only of dismantling it. WSFA sought a preliminary injunction )Tj
T*(prohibiting RKO's majority owners from selling their interests in the company )Tj
T*(to any third parties.[198] The WSFA motion was denied in July 2003, freeing RKO )Tj
T*(to deal with another potential purchaser, InternetStudios.com. In 2004, that )Tj
T*(planned sale fell through when InternetStudios.com apparently folded.[199] The )Tj

T*(consequently, video‚Äîrights to the bulk of the RKO film library were sold at )Tj
T*(auction in 1971 after the holders, TransBeacon \(a corporate descendant of )Tj
T*(C&amp;C Television\), went bankrupt. The auctioned rights were split between )Tj
T*(United Artists and Marian B. Inc. \(MBI\). In 1984, MBI created a subsidiary, )Tj
T*(Marian Pictures Inc. \(MBP\), to which it transferred its share of the RKO )Tj
T*(rights. Two years later GenCorp's subsidiaries, RKO General and RKO Pictures, )Tj
T*(repurchased the rights then controlled by MBP.[205] In the meantime, United )Tj
T*(Artists had been acquired by MGM. In 1986, MGM/UA's considerable library, )Tj
T*(including its RKO rights, was bought by Turner Broadcasting for its new Turner )Tj
T*(Entertainment division. During RKO Pictures' brief Wesray episode, Turner )Tj
T*(acquired many of the distribution rights that had returned to RKO via MBP, as )Tj
T*(well as both the theatrical rights and the TV rights originally held back from )Tj
T*(C&amp;C for the cities where RKO owned stations.[206] )Tj
T*( In October 1996, Turner Broadcasting was merged into Time Warner, which )Tj
T*(controls and distributes the bulk of the RKO library today, though RKO Pictures )Tj
T*(retains the copyright.[207] As for RKO's primary release deals, the Disney )Tj
T*(pictures originally distributed by the studio are controlled by the Walt Disney )Tj
T*(Company. Rights to the Goldwyn features released by RKO, which had been held by )Tj
T*(the Samuel Goldwyn Company, are now controlled by MGM.[208] )Tj
T*( International ownership of TV and video distribution rights to RKO's library )Tj
T*(is divided on a virtual country-by-country basis: In the UK, many of the RKO )Tj

T*( Chadderton \(pop. 33,000\) is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, )Tj
T*(in Greater Manchester, England, historically a part of Lancashire. It lies )Tj
T*(along the course of the River Irk and the Rochdale Canal, on undulating land in )Tj
T*(the foothills of the Pennines, 1 mile \(1.6¬†km\) west of Oldham, 4.5 miles \(7.2¬†)Tj
T*(km\) south of Rochdale, and 6 miles \(9.7¬†km\) northeast of the city of )Tj
T*(Manchester. )Tj
T*( During the Middle Ages, Chadderton was chiefly distinguished by its two )Tj
T*(mansions, Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall, and by the prestigious families )Tj
T*(who occupied them. Its early history is marked by its status as a manorial )Tj
T*(township, with its own line of lords and overlords, who included the Asshetons, )Tj
T*(Chethams, Radclyffes, and Traffords. Farming was the main industry of the area, )Tj
T*(with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the )Tj
T*(domestic system. )Tj
T*( Chadderton's urbanisation and expansion largely coincided with developments in )Tj
T*(textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. A )Tj
T*(late 19th-century factory-building boom transformed Chadderton from a rural )Tj
T*(township into a major mill town‚Äîone of several in its region‚Äîand the second )Tj
T*(most populous urban district in the United Kingdom. More than 50¬†cotton mills )Tj
T*(had been built in Chadderton by 1914. )Tj
T*( Although Chadderton's industries declined during the mid-20th¬†century, the )Tj
T*(town continued to grow as a result of suburbanisation and urban renewal. The )Tj
T*(legacy of the town's industrial past remains visible in its landscape of )Tj
T*(red-brick cotton mills, now used as warehouses or distribution centres. Some of )Tj
T*(these are listed buildings because of their architectural, historical, and )Tj
T*(cultural significance.[1][2] )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Toponymy )Tj
T*( The name Chadderton derives from Caderton, which is believed to be a )Tj
T*(combination of the Brythonic word Cader or Cater \(modern Welsh: Caer\), )Tj
T*(indicating a fortified place amongst the hills, and the Old English suffix -ton )Tj
T*(meaning a settlement.[3][4][5] The University of Nottingham's Institute for )Tj
T*(Name-Studies has offered a similar suggestion, that the name Chadderton means )Tj
T*("farm or settlement at the hill called Cadeir".[6] This name is believed to )Tj
T*(date from the 7th century, when Angles colonised the region following the )Tj
T*(Battle of Chester.[7] It has been suggested that the Anglian settlers found a )Tj
T*(few Brythonic Celts already inhabiting what is now called Chadderton, and )Tj

T*(borrowed their name for the hill, "Chadder", adding their own word for a )Tj
T*(settlement to the end.[8] Archaic spellings include Chaderthon, Chaderton, )Tj
T*(Chaterton, and Chatherton.[9] The first known written record of the name )Tj
T*(Chadderton is in a legal document relating to land tenure, in about 1220.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early history )Tj
T*( The study of place names in Chadderton suggests that the ancient Britons once )Tj
T*(inhabited the area.[8] Remains of Roman roads have been discovered running )Tj
T*(through the town,[3][9] and the local road name Streetbridge suggests that the )Tj
T*(Romans once marched along it on a path which may have led to Blackstone )Tj
T*(Edge.[4][5] Relics found at a tumulus in Chadderton Fold date from the Early )Tj
T*(Middle Ages, probably from the early period of Anglo-Saxon England,[4][9] when )Tj
T*(Angles settled in the area and Chadderton emerged as a manor of the hundred of )Tj
T*(Salford. )Tj
T*( Chadderton is not recorded in the Domesday Book of¬†1086. Its first appearance )Tj
T*(in a written record is in a legal document from around¬†1220, which states that )Tj
T*(Robert, Rector of Prestwich, gave land to Richard, son of Gilbert, in exchange )Tj
T*(for an annual fee of one silver penny.[4] Following the Norman conquest of )Tj
T*(England, Chadderton was made a constituent manor of the wider Royal Estate of )Tj
T*(Tottington, an extensive fee held by the Norman overlord, Roger de )Tj
T*(Montbegon.[3][10] Taxation and governance continued on this basis throughout )Tj
T*(the Middle Ages, with the Barons Montbegon of Hornby Castle holding the estate, )Tj
T*(until it passed to the Barons Lacy of Clitheroe Castle, and then onto local )Tj
T*(families.[3] In about¬†1235, the sub-manor of Chadderton and Foxdenton passed )Tj
T*(from Richard de Trafford of Trafford Park to Geoffrey de Trafford, who adopted )Tj
T*(the surname of Chadderton, thus founding the Chadderton family.[5] During the )Tj
T*(High Middle Ages, pieces of land in Chadderton were granted to religious orders )Tj
T*(and institutions, including Cockersand Abbey and the Knights Hospitaller.[4] )Tj
T*( The manorial system was strong in Chadderton, and this lent distinction to the )Tj
T*(township,[3] in a region which otherwise had weak local lordship.[11] )Tj
T*(Throughout the Middle Ages, the manor of Chadderton constituted a township, )Tj
T*(centred on the hill by the banks of the River Irk, known as Chadderton Fold.[3] )Tj
T*(The fold consisted of a cluster of cottages centred around Chadderton Hall )Tj
T*(manor house, and a water-powered corn mill.[3] Chadderton Hall was owned and )Tj
T*(occupied by the de Chaddertons. Geoffrey de Chadderton became the Lord of the )Tj
T*(Manor of Tottington in the 13th century.[12][13] The de Chaddertons' )Tj
T*(involvement in regional and national affairs gave prestige to what was )Tj
T*(otherwise an obscure and rural township. William Chaderton was Bishop of )Tj
T*(Chester from 1579 to 1595 and held distinguished academic posts such as Lady )Tj
T*(Margaret's Professor of Divinity.[13][14]Laurence Chaderton was the first )Tj
T*(Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and among the first translators of the )Tj
T*(King James Version of the Bible.[13] Tottington was dissolved in the mid-15th )Tj
T*(century and there came a succession of distinguished families, each headed by )Tj
T*(an esquire with links to the monarchs of England. The Radclyffe, Assheton, and )Tj
T*(Horton families provided six High Sheriffs of Lancashire and a Governor of the )Tj
T*(Isle of Man.[13] )Tj
T*( Apart from the dignitaries who lived in Chadderton's manor houses, )Tj
T*(Chadderton's population during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of )Tj
T*(retainers, most of whom were occupied in farming, either growing and milling of )Tj
T*(grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs, and domestic fowl.[5] Workers )Tj
T*(supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning and weaving of wool at )Tj
T*(home.[3][5] The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the Black Death in )Tj
T*(1646.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Textiles and the Industrial Revolution )Tj
T*( Until the mid-18th century, the region in and around Chadderton was dominated )Tj
T*(by dispersed agricultural settlements.[17] During this period the population )Tj
T*(was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with )Tj
T*(pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, )Tj
T*(particularly fustian and silk weaving.[5][18] A fulling mill at Chadderton by )Tj
T*(the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era,[18] and during the Early )Tj

T*(makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century )Tj
T*(industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton.[5] However, as the demand for )Tj
T*(cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved )Tj
T*(during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, )Tj
T*(better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton )Tj
T*(mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776.[12][19][20] The damp )Tj
T*(climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile )Tj
T*(production to be carried out without the thread drying and breaking, and newly )Tj
T*(developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for )Tj
T*(industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the )Tj
T*(Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region )Tj
T*(contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which )Tj
T*(became the dominant source of employment in the locality.[18] The construction )Tj
T*(of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of )Tj
T*(urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population )Tj
T*(increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the )Tj
T*(mechanised production of cotton goods.[11] )Tj
T*( During this early period of change, Chadderton's parliamentary representation )Tj
T*(was limited to two Members of Parliament for Lancashire. Nationally, the end of )Tj
T*(the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and unemployment )Tj
T*(for textile workers. Nevertheless, despite years of distress and unrest, major )Tj
T*(disturbances of machine-breaking did not occur until 1826. By the beginning of )Tj
T*(1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the lack )Tj
T*(of suffrage in northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political )Tj
T*(Radicalism in the region. The Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for )Tj
T*(parliamentary reform, began to organise a mass public demonstration in )Tj
T*(Manchester to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. Organised )Tj
T*(preparations took place, and a spy reported that in neighbouring Thornham, )Tj
T*("seven hundred men drilled¬†... as well as any army regiment would".[23] A few )Tj
T*(days later, on 3¬†August, a royal proclamation forbidding the practice of )Tj
T*(drilling was posted in Manchester.[24] On 16¬†August 1819, Chadderton \(like its )Tj
T*(neighbours\) sent a contingent of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass )Tj
T*(political demonstration now known as the Peterloo Massacre \(owing to the 15 )Tj
T*(deaths and 400‚Äì700 injuries which followed\).[16][25] Two of the 15¬†deceased )Tj
T*(were from the area: John Ashton of Cowhill and Thomas Buckley of Baretrees.[26] )Tj
T*( New markets in Europe and South America increased the demand for Britain's )Tj
T*(cheap cotton goods. Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in )Tj
T*(the United States to Manchester.[27][28] From the markets in Manchester, mill )Tj
T*(owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be )Tj
T*(processed into yarn and cloth. Supplies were cut during the Lancashire Cotton )Tj
T*(Famine of 1861‚Äì65 as a result of the American Civil War, leading to the )Tj
T*(formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873, whose purpose was to )Tj
T*(ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality )Tj
T*(following the crisis.[29] Despite a brief economic depression, the urban growth )Tj
T*(of Chadderton accelerated after the famine. The profitability of factory based )Tj
T*(cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton's plentiful cheap open land, used )Tj
T*(for farming since antiquity, vanished under distinctive rectangular )Tj
T*(multi-storey brick-built factories‚Äî35 by 1891.[18] Chadderton's former villages )Tj
T*(and hamlets agglomerated as a mill town around these factories and a network of )Tj
T*(newly created roads, canals and railways.[19][30][31] The Chadderton landscape )Tj
T*(was "dominated by mill chimneys, many with the mill name picked out in white )Tj
T*(brick".[32] Neighbouring Oldham \(which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest )Tj
T*(and most productive mill town in the world\)[17][33] encroached upon )Tj
T*(Chadderton's eastern boundary, urbanising the town and surrounds,[34] and )Tj
T*(forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Royton, Lees and Shaw )Tj
T*(and Crompton‚Äîthe Oldham parliamentary constituency‚Äîwhich at its peak was )Tj
T*(responsible for 13¬†per¬†cent of the world's cotton production.[35] These )Tj
T*(Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton )Tj

T*(1778 and 1926,[18] and 6,000 people, a quarter of Chadderton's population, )Tj
T*(worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century.[36] Industries )Tj
T*(ancillary to cotton spinning, such as engineering, coal mining, bleaching and )Tj
T*(dyeing became established during this period, meaning the rest of Chadderton's )Tj
T*(population were otherwise involved in the sector. Philip Stott was a )Tj
T*(Chadderton-born architect, civil engineer and surveyor of cotton mills. Stott's )Tj
T*(mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom, )Tj
T*(multiplying the town's industrial capacity and in turn increasing its )Tj
T*(population and productivity.[33] )Tj
T*( The boomtown of Chadderton reached its industrial zenith in the 1910s, with )Tj
T*(over 50¬†cotton mills within the town limits.[19] A social consequence of this )Tj
T*(industrial growth was a densely populated metropolitan landscape, home to an )Tj
T*(extensive and enlarged working class community living in an urban sprawl of low )Tj
T*(quality terraced houses.[37] However, Chadderton developed an abundance of )Tj
T*(civic institutions including public street lighting, Carnegie library, public )Tj
T*(swimming baths, and council with its own town hall. The development of the town )Tj
T*(meant that the district council made initial steps to petition the Crown for )Tj
T*(honorific borough status for Chadderton in the 1930s.[12][29] However, the )Tj
T*(Great Depression, and the First and Second World Wars each contributed to )Tj
T*(periods of economic decline. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns and textile )Tj
T*(goods increased during the mid-20th century, Chadderton's textile sector )Tj
T*(declined to a halt; cotton spinning reduced dramatically in the 1960s and )Tj
T*(1970s, and by 1997 only two mills were operational.[19] In spite of efforts to )Tj
T*(increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton )Tj
T*(was spun in the town in 1998.[16][38] Many of the redundant mills have now been )Tj
T*(demolished. Non-textile based industries continued on throughout the 20th )Tj
T*(century and into the 21st century, particularly in the form of aircraft and )Tj
T*(chemical manufacture at plants in south Chadderton and Foxdenton )Tj
T*(respectively.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Post-industrial history )Tj
T*( During the second half of the 20th¬†century, Chadderton experienced accelerated )Tj
T*(deindustrialisation along with economic decline.[19] Large areas of Victorian )Tj
T*(and Edwardian era terraced housing were identified as unsuited for modern )Tj
T*(needs, and were subsequently demolished.[39] However, the town's population )Tj
T*(continued to grow as a result of urban renewal and modern suburban housing )Tj
T*(developments.[5][40] During the 1970s and 1980s, redevelopment in the form of )Tj
T*(new shopping, health and leisure facilities contributed to the growth and )Tj
T*(renewal of Chadderton.[5][41] In¬†1990, the new Firwood Park, on the west side )Tj
T*(of Chadderton, was said to be the largest private housing estate in )Tj
T*(Europe.[41][42] Chadderton continued to be a regional hub for the secondary )Tj
T*(sector of the economy into the 21st century through BAE Systems and Zetex )Tj
T*(Semiconductors, though BAE Chadderton closed in March 2012.[38][43] Other major )Tj
T*(employers include The Stationery Office and Trinity Mirror.[5][38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Governance )Tj
T*( Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th )Tj
T*(century, the boundaries of Chadderton have varied from time to time.[9] )Tj
T*(Chadderton anciently formed part of the hundred of Salford for civil )Tj
T*(jurisdiction, but for manorial government, Chadderton was a constituent manor )Tj
T*(of the Fee of Tottington, whose overlords were the de Lacys, Barons of )Tj
T*(Clitheroe Castle.[10] The de Chaddertons, Lords of the Manor of Chadderton, )Tj
T*(were accustomed to pay tax to the overlords until the division of )Tj
T*(Tottington.[10][46] In 1507, two constables were appointed to uphold law and )Tj

T*(18 members, would later be based out of Chadderton Town Hall, a purpose built )Tj
T*(municipal building opened in 1913.[45] In 1933, there were exchanges of land )Tj
T*(with the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Middleton and City of )Tj

T*( Chadderton was the second most populous urban district in the United Kingdom )Tj
T*(by the 1930s, and the district council took initial steps to obtain municipal )Tj

T*(Extension Bills for the County Borough of Oldham to amalgamate with Chadderton )Tj
T*(Urban District were rejected by the House of Lords, following objections from )Tj

T*( [edit] Economy )Tj
T*( Up until the 18th century, the inhabitants of Chadderton raised domestic farm )Tj
T*(animals, supplementing their incomes by the spinning and weaving wool in the )Tj
T*(domestic system. Primitive coal mining was established by the 17th century, and )Tj
T*(the factory system adopted in the late-18th century.[5] During the Victorian )Tj
T*(era, Chadderton's economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industries, )Tj
T*(especially the spinning of cotton, but also the weaving of silk and production )Tj
T*(of hats.[19][34] By the 20th century the landscape was covered with over 50 )Tj
T*(cotton mills.[5] Industries ancillary to these sectors, including coal mining, )Tj
T*(brick making, mechanical engineering, and bleaching and dyeing were )Tj
T*(present.[19] Chadderton developed an extensive coal mining sector auxiliary to )Tj
T*(Chadderton's cotton industry and workforce. Coal was transported out of the )Tj
T*(township via the Rochdale Canal. The amount of coal was overestimated however, )Tj
T*(and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning )Tj
T*(industry; Chadderton's last coal mine closed in 1920.[73] )Tj
T*( Since the deindustrialisation of the region in the mid-20th century, these )Tj
T*(industries have been replaced by newer sectors and industries,[19] although )Tj
T*(many of the civic developments that accompanied industrialisation remain in the )Tj
T*(form of public buildings; a town hall, public baths and library.[5] The few )Tj
T*(surviving cotton mills are now occupied by warehousing and distribution )Tj
T*(companies, or used as space for light industry.[74] )Tj
T*( British aircraft manufacturer Avro built a factory in south Chadderton in )Tj
T*(1938‚Äì39.[19][75] It was one of the largest employers in the area, producing a )Tj
T*(variety of aircraft models including Ansons, Manchesters and Bristol )Tj
T*(Blenheims.[75] During the Second World War, 3,050 Avro Lancaster bombers were )Tj
T*(built at the Chadderton factory‚Äîover 40¬†per¬†cent of the Royal Air Force's )Tj
T*(fleet.[19][76] After the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, Avro )Tj
T*(became part of the nationalised British Aerospace \(now BAE Systems\) and )Tj
T*(produced commercial aircraft for Boeing and Airbus.[77][78] )Tj
T*( Chadderton has been described as a "relatively prosperous town [...] which )Tj
T*(makes it a popular residential area".[5] Chadderton Mall is a shopping precinct )Tj
T*(located in the town centre, and is one of Chadderton's main concentrations of )Tj
T*(retailing. It was constructed in 1974, and opened in 1975. It includes an Asda )Tj
T*(supermarket and a variety of smaller shops.[79]The Stationery Office has a base )Tj
T*(in Chadderton, as does 3M. In 2008, 3M was the centre of a high profile robbery )Tj

T*( Foxdenton Hall is a two-storey Georgian mansion and former manor house, with )Tj
T*(an English garden wall bond exterior and its own private gardens.[88] The )Tj
T*(original Hall was erected in the mid-15th century as a home for the Radclyffes, )Tj
T*(who had acquired the title of joint Lords of the Manor with the Asshetons of )Tj
T*(Chadderton, through marriage. This Foxdenton Hall was demolished to make way )Tj
T*(for a second Hall, built in 1620. The ground floor of that second Hall now )Tj
T*(forms the basement of the present Hall, built in 1700.[89] The building is )Tj
T*(described as "a dignified early Georgian house, particularly rare in this part )Tj
T*(of the country".[88] The Radclyffes moved out of Foxdenton Hall in the late )Tj
T*(18th century, favouring properties they had purchased in Dorset, although they )Tj
T*(still maintained ownership.[89] Foxdenton Hall and the adjoining Foxdenton Park )Tj
T*(were leased to Chadderton Council by the Radclyffes in 1922, when they opened )Tj
T*(to the public. In 1960 the council took over ownership of the Hall, by which )Tj
T*(time it was in a state of disrepair. Following protest about funding and the )Tj
T*(condition of the building, Foxdenton Hall was restored in 1965.[90] )Tj
T*( Chadderton War Memorial is located outside Chadderton Town Hall, and was )Tj
T*(originally erected "in honour of the men of Chadderton who made the supreme )Tj
T*(sacrifice and in grateful remembrance of all who served their county" during )Tj
T*(the First World War, but later, the Second World War. It is a granite obelisk )Tj
T*(fronted by three steps. At the front on a short plinth stands a bronze figure )Tj
T*(of an ordinary soldier, holding a rifle in his right hand. It was designed by )Tj
T*(Taylor and Simister and sculpted by Albert Toft. Chadderton War Memorial was )Tj
T*(commissioned by the Chadderton War Memorial Committee and unveiled on 8 October )Tj
T*(1921 by Councillor Ernest Kempsey.[91] )Tj
T*( Chadderton Hall Park is a public park by the River Irk in the north of )Tj
T*(Chadderton, spanning an area of over 15 acres \(6¬†ha\),[92] in what were once the )Tj
T*(gardens of the manorial Chadderton Hall. At the end of the 19th century they )Tj
T*(were leased to Joseph Ball, who transformed the hall and grounds into a )Tj
T*(pleasure garden, complete with a boating lake and a menagerie.[93] The hall was )Tj
T*(demolished in 1939. The park is now owned by Oldham Council, the local )Tj
T*(authority, and was opened to the public in 1956. It was awarded Green Flag )Tj
T*(status in 2006.[92][94] )Tj

T*( [edit] Education )Tj
T*( An old style grammar school at Healds Green in Chadderton was built and )Tj
T*(founded in 1789.[102] As the population of Chadderton grew during the 19th )Tj
T*(century, more schools were opened, each linked with a local church.[34] Mills )Tj
T*(Hill School began as a voluntary aided school belonging to the local Baptist )Tj
T*(church.[102] Further schoolrooms from this period were found at Cowhill )Tj
T*(Methodist Church and Washbrook Methodist Church, opened in 1855 and 1893 )Tj
T*(respectively.[103] )Tj
T*( The Chadderton Grammar School was the first new style co-educational grammar )Tj
T*(school opened by Lancashire County Council. It was opened by David Lindsay, )Tj
T*(28th Earl of Crawford, on 18¬†October 1930. In 1959, it became The Girls' )Tj
T*(Grammar, when a separate school for boys was opened. The Girls' Grammar briefly )Tj
T*(became Mid-Chadderton School, what is now The Radclyffe School, and the boys' )Tj
T*(school part of North Chadderton School.[102][104] Radclyffe and North )Tj
T*(Chadderton are today the town's two co-educational, non-denominational, )Tj
T*(comprehensive secondary schools.[5] North Chadderton School has a sixth form )Tj
T*(college for 16‚Äì19 year-olds. The Radclyffe School, which has specialist )Tj
T*(Technology College status, was modernised in 2008 by way of a ¬£30¬†million new )Tj
T*(school complex opened by Sir Alex Ferguson on 8¬†July 2008.[105] )Tj
T*( [edit] Religion )Tj
T*( Chadderton had no medieval church of its own,[106] and until 1541, for )Tj
T*(ecclesiastical purposes, lay within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the )Tj
T*(Diocese of Lichfield. The diocese was then divided, and Chadderton became part )Tj
T*(of the Diocese of Chester.[16] This in turn was divided in 1847, when the )Tj
T*(present Diocese of Manchester was created. For ritual baptisms, marriages and )Tj
T*(burials, the people of Chadderton, a Christian community, had to travel to )Tj
T*(churches that lay outside of the township's boundaries, including Oldham St )Tj
T*(Mary's, Middleton St Leonard's, and Prestwich St Mary's. The route of some of )Tj
T*(the ancient paths to these churches is preserved in the modern layout of some )Tj
T*(of the town's roads.[107] )Tj
T*( The New Parishes Act 1844 allowed for the creation of a parish for Chadderton, )Tj
T*(dedicated to St Matthew the Evangelist. Services were initially held in the )Tj
T*(stables of Chadderton Hall, and then in a temporary wooden structure opened in )Tj
T*(1848.[108][109] The Church of St Matthew was opened for the parish in 1857 by )Tj
T*(the then Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee.[108][109] A steeple was added )Tj
T*(in 1881.[108] Following the construction of this church, four followed. There )Tj
T*(are now several Anglican parishes, and within them daughter and mission )Tj
T*(churches, serving the town.[106] The parish of St Matthew united with the )Tj
T*(neighbouring parish of St Luke, and the United Benefice of St Matthew with St )Tj
T*(Luke now lies within the Tandle Deanery of the Diocese of Manchester.[110] Also )Tj

T*( Lemurs of Madagascar, currently in its third edition, is a reference work and )Tj
T*(field guide for the lemurs of Madagascar, giving descriptions and biogeographic )Tj
T*(data for the known species. The primary contributor is Russell Mittermeier, )Tj
T*(president of Conservation International, and the cover art and illustrations )Tj
T*(were drawn by Stephen D. Nash. The book provides details about all known lemur )Tj
T*(species, general information about lemurs and their history, and also helps )Tj
T*(travelers identify species they may encounter. Four related pocket field guides )Tj
T*(have also been released, containing color illustrations of each species, )Tj
T*(miniature range maps, and species checklists. )Tj
T*( The first edition was reviewed favorably in the International Journal of )Tj
T*(Primatology, Conservation Biology, and Lemur News. Reviewers, including Alison )Tj
T*(Jolly, praised the book for its meticulous coverage of each species, numerous )Tj
T*(high-quality illustrations, and engaging discussion of lemur topics, including )Tj
T*(conservation, evolution, and the recently extinct subfossil lemurs. Each agreed )Tj
T*(that the book was an excellent resource for a wide audience, including )Tj
T*(ecotourists and lemur researchers. A lengthy review of the second edition was )Tj
T*(published in the American Journal of Primatology, where it received similar )Tj
T*(favorable comments, plus praise for its updates and enhancements. The third )Tj
T*(edition was reviewed favorably in Lemur News; the reviewer praised the expanded )Tj
T*(content of the book, but was concerned that the edition was not as portable as )Tj
T*(its predecessors. )Tj
T*( The first edition identified 50¬†lemur species and subspecies, compared to 71 )Tj
T*(in the second edition and 101 in the third. The taxonomy promoted by these )Tj
T*(books has been questioned by researchers, such as Ian Tattersall, who view )Tj
T*(these growing numbers of lemur species as insufficiently justified inflation of )Tj
T*(species numbers \(taxonomic inflation\). )Tj
T*( [edit] Overview )Tj
T*( Lemurs of Madagascar is published by Conservation International \(CI\), a )Tj
T*(non-profit conservation organization headquartered near Washington, D.C., and )Tj
T*(is intended as a field guide that identifies all of the known lemur species )Tj
T*(from Madagascar.[1] The first edition of Lemurs of Madagascar was published in )Tj
T*(1994 and contained 356¬†pages. The 520-page second edition was published in 2006 )Tj
T*(and is now officially out of print, having been followed by the 767-page third )Tj
T*(edition in the fall of 2010.[2] )Tj
T*( For all three editions, Stephen D. Nash, winner of the 2004 American Society )Tj
T*(of Primatologists President's Award,[3] has been the illustrator and front )Tj
T*(cover artist. The main author for all three editions is Russell A. Mittermeier, )Tj
T*(president of CI and a well-published primatologist, herpetologist and )Tj
T*(biological anthropologist.[4] In the first edition, four other authors were )Tj
T*(also listed: Ian Tattersall, a curator in the Division of Anthropology at the )Tj
T*(American Museum of Natural History; William R. Konstant, the Director of )Tj
T*(Conservation and Science at the Houston Zoo; David M. Meyers, a researcher and )Tj
T*(conservationist who has worked with CI, the World Wildlife Fund, and other )Tj

T*(tourists in the identification of lemur species and subspecies, according to a )Tj
T*(1996 review published in Lemur News. All three editions cover the natural )Tj
T*(history and conservation status for each known species. They also discuss )Tj
T*(conservation strategies, lemur origins, extinct lemurs, and the history of )Tj
T*(discoveries made by early European naturalists. The books provide suggestions )Tj

T*(sections. A section entitled "How to Use this Field Guide" is included between )Tj
T*(the "Introduction" and the first chapter. In this section, the layout of the )Tj
T*(book is discussed in detail, including the quick visual reference, chapters, )Tj
T*(appendices, references, and lemur-watching checklist. The chapter "The Living )Tj
T*(Lemurs" is discussed in great detail, including each section heading used for )Tj
T*(all the lemur species.[14][15] )Tj
T*( The "Introduction" in the first two editions was written by Peter A. )Tj
T*(Seligmann, Chairman of the Board and CEO of CI, and Mittermeier.[16][17] In the )Tj
T*(third edition, the "Introduction" was written only by Mittermeier.[18] In it, )Tj
T*(they emphasize the richness of Madagascar's primate diversity, summarize the )Tj
T*(conservation efforts and opportunities for preserving that diversity, and )Tj
T*(highlight recent discoveries, while also acknowledging the need for additional )Tj
T*(research.[16][17] The chapter entitled "Origins of Lemurs" \("Origin of the )Tj
T*(Lemurs" in the third edition\) briefly summarizes the theories on how lemurs )Tj
T*(came to Madagascar and the difficulty in resolving the mystery.[19][20][21] )Tj
T*("Discovery and Study of the Living Lemurs" reviews the history of exploration, )Tj
T*(field research, and taxonomic nomenclature of lemurs,[22][23][24] starting from )Tj
T*(the 1625 description of a Ring-tailed Lemur to contemporary research by Western )Tj
T*(and Malagasy scientists.[1] "The Extinct Lemurs" discusses the recently extinct )Tj
T*(subfossil lemurs, including the monkey lemurs, sloth lemurs, and koala )Tj
T*(lemurs.[25][26][27] "Conservation of Lemurs" details the threats lemurs face, )Tj
T*(such as habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat, and conservation efforts )Tj
T*(aimed at their protection, from the in-situ and ex-situ programs of the )Tj
T*(Madagascar Fauna Group to the promise by Madagascar's former president Marc )Tj
T*(Ravalomanana to triple the country's protected areas over five years, known as )Tj
T*(the Durban Vision.[28][29][30] In the third edition, a new chapter was added, )Tj
T*(entitled "Madagascar's Ancient Geological History", written by Maarten de Wit )Tj
T*(from the University of Cape Town. In it, three billion years of geological and )Tj
T*(biological history are explored in detail.[31] )Tj
T*( The majority of the book, including the chapter "The Living Lemurs" and )Tj
T*(separate sections on each taxonomic group of lemur, providing detailed accounts )Tj
T*(of all lemur species known up until the time of publication, from the tiny )Tj
T*(mouse lemurs to the large indri and diademed sifaka. In the first and second )Tj
T*(editions, the chapter "The Living Lemurs" is broken first into sections on )Tj
T*(families, and then into species clumped together by genus.[32][33] In the third )Tj
T*(edition, each family is assigned its own chapter number, separate from "The )Tj
T*(Living Lemurs" chapter, yet the order and layout are the same.[34] In the )Tj
T*(second and third editions, all pages within each family section are assigned a )Tj
T*(colored tab to match those in the quick visual reference inside the )Tj

T*(or the nest-building behavior of the ruffed lemurs.[37] Estimated populations )Tj
T*(densities and distributions, life histories, diet, social structure, and other )Tj
T*(details are provided when known. For many species, little information is given )Tj
T*(due to a lack of research, while others have been studied extensively allowing )Tj
T*(for more elaborate detail. "Conservation Status" lists the IUCN Red List of )Tj
T*(Threatened Species assessment and protected areas in which a species can be )Tj
T*(found, while also discussing specific threats to each species, the effects of )Tj
T*(local taboos \(known locally as fady\), the future outlook for species survival, )Tj
T*(and its coverage within protected areas. Lastly, "Where to See It" aims to )Tj
T*(promote ecotourism by helping travelers find the best lemur watching sites that )Tj
T*(can be reached quickly and with the least effort. Suggested modes of )Tj
T*(transportation are sometimes mentioned as well.[3][15][14] )Tj
T*( The appendices differ between editions. The first edition has two appendices. )Tj
T*(The first is entitled "Lemurs Present in Protected Areas" and discusses each )Tj
T*(region and domain of Madagascar while also providing basic information and )Tj
T*(lemur species content for each protected area.[38] The second appendix, )Tj
T*("Alternative Names for Towns and Sites in Madagascar" spells out a few )Tj
T*(alternative French and Malagasy names for some of the larger town and cities in )Tj
T*(Madagascar.[39] In the second and third editions, Appendix A, "Maps of )Tj
T*(Madagascar", contains color maps that help locate towns, protected areas, )Tj
T*(topography, rivers, forest cover, regions, and lemur watching sites.[40][41] )Tj
T*(Appendix B, entitled "Biogeographic Regions and Floristic Domains of )Tj
T*(Madagascar" discusses the regions and domains of Madagascar.[42][43] Appendix )Tj
T*(C, "Key Sites for Watching Lemurs", covers characteristics and highlights of )Tj
T*(individual national parks, reserves, and regions for lemur watching.[44][45] )Tj
T*(The third edition added Appendix D, entitled "Primate-watching and Primate )Tj
T*(Life-listing". In it, primate-watching and primate life-listing \(the act of )Tj
T*(recording recording personal first sightings of a species\) are promoted while )Tj
T*(their benefits to conservation are discussed.[46] )Tj
T*( All three editions provide a "References" section,[47][48][49] with the second )Tj
T*(edition listing approximately 500 scientific papers, books, reports, and )Tj
T*(dissertations used in the creation of the book.[48] The number of references )Tj
T*(jumped to over 1,100 in the third edition.[15] Following the "References", the )Tj
T*(first edition provides a section with the color plates.[50] In contrast, the )Tj
T*(second and third editions provides color illustrations throughout the book.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reviews )Tj
T*( In a 1996 review of the first edition in the International Journal of )Tj
T*(Primatology, Lisa Gould spoke favorably of the book, citing passages about )Tj
T*(lemur descriptions from the 17th and 18th centuries that she found entertaining )Tj
T*(and informative. She was particularly fascinated with Chapter four, "The )Tj
T*(Extinct Lemurs", and the reconstructions by Nash that accompanied the )Tj
T*(descriptions of morphology, behavior, and diet. She praised Nash's artwork as )Tj
T*(being one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book. The book was hailed as an )Tj
T*(excellent source for identifying lemur species for both tourists and )Tj
T*(researchers.[1] The book was also briefly reviewed in College &amp; Research )Tj
T*(Libraries News by George Eberhart in April 1996. The review noted Conservation )Tj
T*(International's promotion of ecotourism while also providing a count of the )Tj
T*(book's illustrations: 35 color plates, 50 distribution maps, and 135 drawings )Tj
T*(of postures and behaviors.[51] )Tj
T*( In the 1996 edition \(volume 2\) of Lemur News, Alison Jolly praised the first )Tj
T*(edition for its "contribution to knowledge in general" and "its effect on its )Tj
T*(intended audience." Like Gould, Jolly praised the work as a field guide, as )Tj
T*(well as Nash's high-quality illustrations. She noted the attraction of Nash's )Tj
T*(subfossil lemur reconstruction, claiming that it was "rapidly becoming one of )Tj
T*(the most pirated single book illustration on the primate lecture-slide )Tj
T*(circuit." Jolly went on to praise the thoroughness of the natural history )Tj

T*(information provided for each species, including recently described species, )Tj
T*(noting that the information covered existing knowledge better than any other )Tj
T*(published literature, even when only a single paragraph was provided for poorly )Tj
T*(known species. The book was recommended not only for lemur specialists, but )Tj
T*(also for tourists, hoping it would spark an interest in ecotourism in )Tj
T*(impoverished Madagascar. The checklist of species, as well as the information )Tj
T*(on where to most easily spot them, earned a special mention from Jolly, who )Tj
T*(could only boast seeing 30 of the 50 known species at that time. Finally, the )Tj
T*("most significant and most appreciative" audience Jolly mentioned was the )Tj
T*(Malagasy researchers, to whom Mittermeier reportedly gave 50 copies of the book )Tj
T*(during a workshop in 1995.[7] )Tj
T*( In a 1997 review from Conservation Biology by Joelisoa Ratsirarson, the book )Tj
T*(was referred to as a "remarkable achievement" for its up-to-date information, )Tj
T*(and for being the first comprehensive lemur field guide. Emphasizing many of )Tj
T*(the same highlights as Gould and Jolly, he went on to note the inclusion of )Tj
T*(captive management information, unpublished details, and the use of common )Tj
T*(names in English, French, German, and Malagasy. His critique focused on the )Tj
T*(organization of the illustrations in relation to the text, the lack of an )Tj
T*(index, and a desire for more information about the roles lemurs play in their )Tj
T*(ecosystem. Though he praised it for being useful to tourists, researchers, )Tj
T*(students, resource managers, and conservationists, he expressed concern over )Tj
T*(its lack of availability in the bookstores of Madagascar.[52] )Tj
T*( The completely revised second edition of Lemurs of Madagascar was reviewed in )Tj
T*(detail in the American Journal of Primatology by Stacey Tecot. Each chapter, )Tj
T*(section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of )Tj
T*(previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted as one of the more )Tj
T*("fascinating" parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and )Tj
T*(informative illustrations. Although the book received only praise, Tecot did )Tj
T*(suggest two additions for the next edition: the need for information about the )Tj
T*(processes of island biogeography and expansion on captive conservation programs )Tj
T*(aside from the Duke Lemur Center, particularly at the Lemur Conservation )Tj
T*(Foundation and St. Catherines Island. A subject index was also recommended, )Tj
T*(along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations. Otherwise, the )Tj
T*(book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion )Tj
T*(of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as how to get to lemur )Tj
T*(watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, )Tj
T*(listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other )Tj
T*(things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area. Tecot noted that )Tj
T*(the lemur checklist promoted competitive lemur watching, similar to )Tj
T*(birdwatching, and that the color-coded sections assisted in "on-the-fly species )Tj
T*(identification." Although very satisfied with the information provided for each )Tj
T*(species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively )Tj
T*(cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition. Like its )Tj
T*(predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for )Tj
T*(ecotourists and researchers. It was also noted for its attempt to promote )Tj
T*(ecotourism as a conservation strategy.[3] )Tj
T*( This newer edition was also mentioned briefly in the 2006 edition \(volume 11\) )Tj
T*(of Lemur News. The publication announcement highlighted the extensive coverage )Tj
T*(of scientific information throughout a range of chapters and appendices. The )Tj
T*(edition is said to contain over 200 illustrations, including drawings, photos, )Tj
T*(and maps.[53] )Tj
T*( The 2010 third edition was reviewed in Lemur News by Alex Dunkel. He praised )Tj
T*(the increased level of detail in the new edition, which adds additional )Tj
T*(information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of )Tj
T*(lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel )Tj
T*(wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these )Tj
T*(challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that )Tj
T*(the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.[54] )Tj

T*(subspecies\), the second edition recognized 71 lemur taxa \(68¬†species and 5¬†)Tj
T*(subspecies\) just 12¬†years later.[57] The second edition followed the )Tj
T*(recommendations of Colin Groves in the third edition of Mammal Species of the )Tj
T*(World from 2005 by recognizing newly identified nocturnal species and raising )Tj
T*(many former subspecies to species status.[58] For comparison, Tattersall's book )Tj
T*(Primates of Madagascar from 1982 listed only 20¬†species and 29¬†subspecies.[59] )Tj
T*(Following the publication of the second edition, Nick Garbutt recognized 87¬†)Tj
T*(species and 5¬†subspecies in his book Mammals of Madagascar.[60] )Tj
T*( Not all lemur researchers agree with the species promotions supported by these )Tj
T*(books. Researchers such as Tattersall and Anne D. Yoder, director of the Duke )Tj
T*(Lemur Center, have raised concerns about taxonomic inflation.[58][61] In )Tj
T*(particular, Tattersall has noted a steep decline in polytypic lemur species, or )Tj
T*(species with defined subspecies, starting with the first edition of Lemurs of )Tj
T*(Madagascar and becoming more pronounced in the second edition. He noted that )Tj
T*(more than half of the new species added in the second edition were promoted )Tj
T*(subspecies and questioned whether Madagascar could produce so many monotypic )Tj
T*(species.[58] )Tj
T*( Prior to the release of the third edition of Lemurs of Madagascar, many of the )Tj
T*(major contributors, as well as Colin Groves, teamed up in 2008 to compile an )Tj
T*(updated lemur species list, published under the title "Lemur diversity in )Tj
T*(Madagascar" in the International Journal of Primatology. In it, 99¬†lemur taxa )Tj
T*(were recognized \(97¬†species and 3¬†subspecies\).[62] The third edition went on to )Tj
T*(recognize 101¬†lemur taxa \(97¬†species and 6¬†subspecies\) and suggested that )Tj
T*(future research could reveal as many as 110 to 125 taxa.[18]  )Tj

T*( A globular cluster is a spherical collection of stars that orbits a galactic )Tj
T*(core as a satellite. Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity, which )Tj
T*(gives them their spherical shapes and relatively high stellar densities toward )Tj
T*(their centers. The name of this category of star cluster is derived from the )Tj
T*(Latin globulus‚Äîa small sphere. A globular cluster is sometimes known more )Tj
T*(simply as a globular. )Tj
T*( Globular clusters, which are found in the halo of a galaxy, contain )Tj
T*(considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense galactic, or )Tj
T*(open clusters, which are found in the disk. Globular clusters are fairly )Tj
T*(common; there are about 150[2] to 158[3] currently known globular clusters in )Tj
T*(the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered.[4] Large galaxies )Tj
T*(can have more: Andromeda, for instance, may have as many as 500.[5] Some giant )Tj
T*(elliptical galaxies, particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters, such )Tj
T*(as M87,[6] have as many as 13,000 globular clusters. These globular clusters )Tj
T*(orbit the galaxy out to large radii, 40 kiloparsecs \(approximately 131,000 )Tj
T*(light-years\) or more.[7] )Tj
T*( Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has an associated group of )Tj
T*(globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed has been found to )Tj
T*(possess a system of globular clusters.[8] The Sagittarius Dwarf and Canis Major )Tj
T*(Dwarf galaxies appear to be in the process of donating their associated )Tj
T*(globular clusters \(such as Palomar 12\) to the Milky Way.[9] This demonstrates )Tj
T*(how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the )Tj
T*(past. )Tj
T*( Although it appears that globular clusters contain some of the first stars to )Tj
T*(be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution )Tj
T*(are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are )Tj
T*(significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part )Tj
T*(of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate )Tj
T*(galaxy.[10] However, recent conjectures by astronomers suggest that globular )Tj
T*(clusters and dwarf spheroidals may not be clearly separate and distinct types )Tj
T*(of objects.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Observation history )Tj
T*( The first globular cluster discovered was M22 in 1665 by Abraham Ihle, a )Tj
T*(German amateur astronomer.[12] However, given the small aperture of early )Tj
T*(telescopes, individual stars within a globular cluster were not resolved until )Tj
T*(Charles Messier observed M4.[13] The first eight globular clusters discovered )Tj
T*(are shown in the table. Subsequently, Abb√© Lacaille would list NGC 104, NGC )Tj
T*(4833, M55, M69, and NGC 6397 in his 1751‚Äì52 catalogue. The M before a number )Tj
T*(refers to the catalogue of Charles Messier, while NGC is from the New General )Tj
T*(Catalogue by John Dreyer. )Tj
T*( William Herschel began a survey program in 1782 using larger telescopes and )Tj
T*(was able to resolve the stars in all 33 of the known globular clusters. In )Tj
T*(addition he found 37 additional clusters. In Herschel's 1789 catalog of deep )Tj
T*(sky objects, his second such, he became the first to use the name globular )Tj
T*(cluster as their description.[13] )Tj
T*( The number of globular clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 )Tj
T*(in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters have now )Tj
T*(been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ¬± )Tj
T*(20.[4] These additional, undiscovered globular clusters are believed to be )Tj
T*(hidden behind the gas and dust of the Milky Way. )Tj
T*( Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began a series of studies of globular )Tj
T*(clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae )Tj
T*(variables in the clusters \(which he assumed were cepheid variables\) and would )Tj
T*(use their period‚Äìluminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was )Tj
T*(found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than cepheid variables, which caused )Tj
T*(Shapley to overestimate the distance to the clusters.[14] )Tj
T*( Of the globular clusters within our Milky Way, the majority are found in the )Tj
T*(vicinity of the galactic core, and the large majority lie on the side of the )Tj
T*(celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918 this strongly asymmetrical )Tj

T*(distribution was used by Harlow Shapley to make a determination of the overall )Tj
T*(dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of )Tj
T*(globular clusters around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the )Tj
T*(clusters to estimate the position of the sun relative to the galactic )Tj
T*(center.[15] While his distance estimate was significantly in error, it did )Tj
T*(demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been )Tj
T*(previously thought. His error was because dust in the Milky Way diminished the )Tj
T*(amount of light from a globular cluster that reached the earth, thus making it )Tj
T*(appear farther away. Shapley's estimate was, however, within the same order of )Tj
T*(magnitude as the currently accepted value. )Tj
T*( Shapley's measurements also indicated that the Sun was relatively far from the )Tj
T*(center of the galaxy, contrary to what had previously been inferred from the )Tj
T*(apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, ordinary )Tj
T*(stars lie within the galaxy's disk and are thus often obscured by gas and dust, )Tj
T*(whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further )Tj
T*(distances. )Tj
T*( Shapley was subsequently assisted in his studies of clusters by Henrietta )Tj

T*( At present, the formation of globular clusters remains a poorly understood )Tj
T*(phenomenon, and it remains uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster )Tj
T*(form in a single generation, or are spawned across multiple generations over a )Tj
T*(period of several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the )Tj
T*(stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that )Tj
T*(they formed at about the same time.[18] However, the star formation history )Tj
T*(varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations )Tj
T*(of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic )Tj
T*(Cloud \(LMC\) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC )Tj
T*(clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second )Tj
T*(round of star formation.[19] This star-forming period is relatively brief, )Tj
T*(compared to the age of many globular clusters.[20] )Tj
T*( Observations of globular clusters show that these stellar formations arise )Tj
T*(primarily in regions of efficient star formation, and where the interstellar )Tj
T*(medium is at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. Globular )Tj
T*(cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting )Tj
T*(galaxies.[21] Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central )Tj
T*(supermassive black holes \(SMBH\) and the extent of the globular cluster systems )Tj
T*(of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is )Tj
T*(often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's globular clusters.[22] )Tj
T*( No known globular clusters display active star formation, which is consistent )Tj
T*(with the view that globular clusters are typically the oldest objects in the )Tj
T*(Galaxy, and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large )Tj
T*(regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in )Tj
T*(the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.[23] )Tj

T*(proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older )Tj

T*( The Dutch astronomer Pieter Oosterhoff noticed that there appear to be two )Tj

T*(light, or B, and the magnitude in visual light \(green-yellow\), or V. Large )Tj
T*(positive values indicate a red star with a cool surface temperature, while )Tj
T*(negative values imply a blue star with a hotter surface. )Tj
T*( When the stars near the Sun are plotted on an HR diagram, it displays a )Tj

T*(diagram also typically includes stars that are in later stages of their )Tj
T*(evolution and have wandered away from this main-sequence curve. )Tj
T*( As all the stars of a globular cluster are at approximately the same distance )Tj
T*(from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about )Tj

T*(results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, )Tj

T*( By matching up these curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of )Tj

T*(distance from the core, most clusters in the Milky Way increase steadily in )Tj
T*(luminosity as this distance decreases, up to a certain distance from the core, )Tj
T*(then the luminosity levels off. Typically this distance is about 1‚Äì2 parsecs )Tj
T*(from the core. However about 20% of the globular clusters have undergone a )Tj
T*(process termed "core collapse". In this type of cluster, the luminosity )Tj
T*(continues to increase steadily all the way to the core region.[54] An example )Tj
T*(of a core-collapsed globular is M15. )Tj
T*( Core-collapse is thought to occur when the more massive stars in a globular )Tj
T*(cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes )Tj
T*(cause individual stars to migrate from the center of the cluster to the )Tj
T*(outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, )Tj
T*(leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact )Tj
T*(volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the )Tj
T*(cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the )Tj
T*(cluster forms a power-law cusp.[55] \(Note that a core collapse is not the only )Tj
T*(mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole )Tj
T*(at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.\)[56] Over a lengthy period of )Tj
T*(time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon )Tj
T*(called mass segregation. )Tj
T*( The dynamical heating effect of binary star systems works to prevent an )Tj
T*(initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a binary system, )Tj
T*(the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract, releasing energy. Only after )Tj
T*(the primordial supply of binaries are exhausted due to interactions can a )Tj
T*(deeper core collapse proceed.[57][58] In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks )Tj
T*(as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy )Tj
T*(tends to significantly accelerate core collapse.[59] )Tj
T*( The different stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During )Tj
T*(a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with )Tj
T*(stars near the core. However, the interactions between binary star systems )Tj
T*(prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age. Finally, the )Tj
T*(central binaries are either disrupted or ejected, resulting in a tighter )Tj
T*(concentration at the core. )Tj
T*( The interaction of stars in the collapsed core region causes tight binary )Tj
T*(systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they )Tj
T*(increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand. As the )Tj

T*(the pull of gravity between the part of the cluster nearest the mass and the )Tj
T*(pull on the furthest part of the cluster results in a tidal force. A "tidal )Tj
T*(shock" occurs whenever the orbit of a cluster takes it through the plane of a )Tj
T*(galaxy. )Tj
T*( As a result of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the )Tj
T*(cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal )Tj
T*(interaction effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees )Tj
T*(of arc away from the cluster.[75] These tails typically both precede and follow )Tj
T*(the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of )Tj
T*(the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.[76] )Tj
T*( The globular cluster Palomar 5, for example, is near the apogalactic point of )Tj
T*(its orbit after passing through the Milky Way. Streams of stars extend outward )Tj
T*(toward the front and rear of the orbital path of this cluster, stretching out )Tj
T*(to distances of 13,000 light-years.[77] Tidal interactions have stripped away )Tj
T*(much of the mass from Palomar 5, and further interactions as it passes through )Tj
T*(the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream of stars )Tj
T*(orbiting the Milky Way halo. )Tj
T*( Tidal interactions add kinetic energy into a globular cluster, dramatically )Tj
T*(increasing the evaporation rate and shrinking the size of the cluster.[50] Not )Tj
T*(only does tidal shock strip off the outer stars from a globular cluster, but )Tj
T*(the increased evaporation accelerates the process of core collapse. The same )Tj
T*(physical mechanism may be at work in Dwarf spheroidal galaxies such as the )Tj
T*(Sagittarius Dwarf, which appears to be undergoing tidal disruption due to its )Tj
T*(proximity to the Milky Way. )Tj
T*( There are many globular clusters with a retrograde orbit round the galaxy.[78] )Tj
T*( [edit] Planets )Tj
T*( In 2000, the results of a search for giant planets in the globular cluster 47 )Tj
T*(Tucanae were announced. The lack of any successful discoveries suggests that )Tj
T*(the abundance of elements \(other than hydrogen or helium\) necessary to build )Tj
T*(these planets may need to be at least 40% of the abundance in the Sun. )Tj
T*(Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and )Tj
T*(magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means )Tj
T*(that the members stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass )Tj
T*(planets, when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. Hence the halo )Tj
T*(region of the Milky Way galaxy, including globular cluster members, are )Tj
T*(unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.[79] )Tj
