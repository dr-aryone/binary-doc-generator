T*( Knut \(German pronunciation: [ÀàknuÀêt]¬†\( listen\); 5 December 2006 ‚Äì 19 March )Tj
T*(2011\) was a polar bear who was born in captivity at the Berlin Zoological )Tj
T*(Garden. Rejected by his mother at birth, he was raised by zookeepers. He was )Tj
T*(the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than )Tj
T*(30 years. At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a )Tj
T*(tourist attraction and commercial success.[1] After the German tabloid )Tj
T*(newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that decried keeping )Tj
T*(the cub in captivity, fans worldwide rallied in support of his being )Tj
T*(hand-raised by humans. Children protested outside the zoo, and e-mails and )Tj
T*(letters expressing sympathy for the cub's life were sent from around the world. )Tj
T*( Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed "Knutmania" that )Tj
T*(spanned the globe and spawned toys, media specials, DVDs, and books. Because of )Tj
T*(this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, )Tj
T*(estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007. Attendance )Tj
T*(figures for the year increased by an estimated 30 percent, making it the most )Tj
T*(profitable year in its 163-year history.[2] )Tj
T*( On 19 March 2011, Knut unexpectedly died at the age of four. His death was )Tj
T*(caused by drowning after he collapsed into his enclosure's pool while suffering )Tj
T*(from encephalitis. )Tj
T*( [edit] Infancy )Tj
T*( Knut was born at the Berlin Zoo to 20-year-old Tosca, a former circus )Tj
T*(performer from East Germany who was born in Canada, and her 13-year-old mate )Tj
T*(Lars, who was originally from the Tierpark Hellabrunn in Munich. After an )Tj
T*(uncomplicated gestation, Knut and his unnamed brother were born on 5 December )Tj
T*(2006. Tosca rejected her cubs for unknown reasons, abandoning them on a rock in )Tj
T*(the polar bear enclosure.[3] Zookeepers rescued the cubs by scooping them out )Tj
T*(of the enclosure with an extended fishing net,[3] but Knut's brother died of an )Tj
T*(infection four days later. Knut was the first polar bear to have been born and )Tj
T*(survive in the Berlin Zoo in over 30 years. Only the size of a guinea pig, he )Tj
T*(spent the first 44 days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas )Tj
T*(D√∂rflein began raising the cub.[4] )Tj
T*( Knut's need for round-the-clock care required that D√∂rflein not only sleep on )Tj
T*(a mattress next to Knut's sleeping crate at night, but also play with, bathe, )Tj
T*(and feed the cub daily. Knut's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed )Tj
T*(with cod liver oil every two hours, before graduating at the age of four months )Tj
T*(to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins. D√∂rflein also accompanied )Tj
T*(Knut on his twice-daily one-hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in )Tj
T*(many videos and photographs alongside the cub. As a result, D√∂rflein became a )Tj
T*(minor celebrity in Germany[5] and was awarded Berlin's Medal of Merit in honour )Tj
T*(of his continuous care for the cub.[6] D√∂rflein died of a heart attack on 22 )Tj
T*(September 2008. He was 44 years old.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Controversy and media coverage )Tj
T*( In early March 2007, German tabloid Bild-Zeitung carried a quote by animal )Tj
T*(rights activist Frank Albrecht who said that Knut should have been killed )Tj
T*(rather than be raised by humans. He declared that the zoo was violating animal )Tj
T*(protection legislation by keeping him alive.[8] Wolfram Graf-Rudolf, the )Tj
T*(director of the Aachen Zoo, agreed with Albrecht and stated that the zookeepers )Tj
T*("should have had the courage to let the bear die" after it was rejected, )Tj
T*(arguing that the bear will "die a little" every time it is separated from its )Tj
T*(caretaker.[9] A group of children protested at the zoo, holding up placards )Tj
T*(reading "Knut Must Live" and "We Love Knut", and others sent numerous emails )Tj
T*(and letters asking for the cub's life to be spared. Threatening letters were )Tj
T*(also sent to Albrecht.[10] The Berlin Zoo rallied in support of the baby polar )Tj
T*(bear, vowing not to harm him and rejecting the suggestion that it would be )Tj
T*(kinder to euthanise him.[9] )Tj
T*( Albrecht stated his original aim was to draw attention to the law, not to have )Tj
T*(Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo )Tj
T*(to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case )Tj
T*(was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been )Tj

T*(against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht )Tj
T*(said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs.[10][11] The )Tj
T*(publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to )Tj
T*(international.[12][13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Debut and first year )Tj
T*( On 23 March 2007, Knut was presented to the public for the first time.[14] )Tj
T*(Around 400 journalists visited the Berlin Zoo on what was dubbed "Knut Day" to )Tj
T*(report on the cub's first public appearance to a worldwide audience.[15] )Tj
T*(Because Knut became the focus of worldwide media at a very young age, many )Tj
T*(stories and false alarms regarding the cub's health and well-being were )Tj
T*(circulated during his first year. For example, on 16 April 2007, Knut was )Tj
T*(removed from display due to teething pains resulting from the growth of his )Tj
T*(right upper canine tooth, but initial reports vaguely stated that he was )Tj
T*(suffering from an unknown illness and subsequently put on antibiotics.[16] Much )Tj
T*(ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15:00 local )Tj
T*(time on Wednesday 18 April 2007. The zoo had received an anonymous letter by )Tj
T*(fax which said "Knut ist tot! Donnerstag Mittag." \("Knut is dead! Thursday )Tj
T*(noon."\)[17] In response, the police increased their security measures around )Tj
T*(the bear. The time frame for the threat passed without incident or harm to )Tj
T*(Knut.[18][19] )Tj
T*( Despite Der Spiegel reporting on 30 April 2007 that Knut was "steadily getting )Tj
T*(less cute" as he increased in age,[20] Knut continued to bring in record crowds )Tj
T*(to the zoo that summer. After reaching seven months old and 50¬†kg \(110¬†lb\) in )Tj
T*(July 2007, Knut's scheduled twice daily public appearances were canceled due to )Tj
T*(the zoo's concern for the safety of his keeper. Zoo spokeswoman Regine Damm )Tj
T*(also said it was time for the bear to "associate with other bears and not with )Tj
T*(other people."[21] After living in the same enclosure as Ernst, a Malaysian )Tj
T*(black bear cub who was born a month before Knut, and its mother,[22] Knut was )Tj
T*(then moved to his own private living space. While visitor numbers dwindled from )Tj
T*(extreme highs in March and April, Knut remained a major attraction at the zoo )Tj
T*(for the rest of 2007. 400,000 guests were recorded in August 2007, which was an )Tj
T*(all time high.[23] )Tj
T*( News of Knut and his life at the zoo was still being reported internationally )Tj
T*(in late 2007. Knut's restricted diet, necessary to curtail his natural weight )Tj
T*(gain necessary to survive harsh winters, made headlines outside of Germany.[24] )Tj
T*(His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three, and treats, such as )Tj
T*(croissants, which were favored by the young polar bear, were restricted.[25] )Tj
T*(After hurting his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month )Tj
T*(later in September, there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans )Tj
T*(worldwide.[26] )Tj
T*( In November 2007 and weighing over 90¬†kg \(198¬†lb\), Knut was deemed too )Tj
T*(dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was )Tj
T*(further diminished. The celebration of the cub's first birthday, which was )Tj
T*(attended by hundreds of children, was broadcast live on German television. The )Tj
T*(national mint also issued 25,000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his )Tj
T*(birthday.[27] Knut's role at the Berlin Zoo was to have included his becoming )Tj
T*(an "attractive stud" for other zoos in order to help preserve his species.[28] )Tj
T*(When Flocke was born at the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2007 under similar )Tj
T*(circumstances, Bild dubbed her Mrs. Knut, suggesting that the two German-born )Tj
T*(polar bears might become mates when they matured.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] 2008‚Äì2010 )Tj
T*( A year after his public debut, Knut was reported as weighing more than 130¬†kg )Tj
T*(\(286¬†lb\). A plate of six-inch glass, strong enough to resist a mortar blast, )Tj
T*(was erected between him and zoo visitors.[30] At the end of March 2008, Markus )Tj
T*(R√∂bke, one of the keepers who helped rear Knut, reported that the bear should )Tj
T*(leave the zoo as soon as possible in order to help him acclimate to a life )Tj
T*(alone.[31] R√∂bke also said that Knut plainly misses his past father-figure, )Tj
T*(Thomas D√∂rflein, and has become so used to attention that he cries when no one )Tj
T*(is near his enclosure. "Knut needs an audience," R√∂bke stated. "That has to )Tj
T*(change".[31] In April, animal welfare campaigners criticized the zoo for )Tj

T*(allowing Knut to kill and eat ten carp from the moat surrounding his enclosure, )Tj
T*(saying that it was a breach of German animal protection regulations. The zoo's )Tj
T*(bear expert, Heiner Kl√∂s, however, said that Knut's behavior was "all part of )Tj
T*(being a polar bear."[32] )Tj
T*( In July 2008, it was announced that the Neum√ºnster Zoo in northern Germany, )Tj
T*(which owns Knut's father, was suing the Berlin Zoo for the profits from Knut's )Tj
T*(success.[33] Although the Berlin Zoo conceded Neum√ºnster's ownership of Knut )Tj
T*(due to a previous agreement, it contended that the other zoo has no right to )Tj
T*(its proceeds. Neum√ºnster had previously tried to negotiate with Berlin Zoo, but )Tj
T*(later sought a court ruling in their favor. Peter Dr√ºwa, the zoo director at )Tj
T*(Neum√ºnster, stated that they "do not want to remove Knut from his environment, )Tj
T*(but we have a right to our request for money."[34] Shortly before Knut's second )Tj
T*(birthday, reports began circulating that the bear would have to be relocated to )Tj
T*(another zoo because he was becoming too large for his enclosure. The zoo later )Tj
T*(released statements that they wish to keep Knut, and the mayor of Berlin, Klaus )Tj
T*(Wowereit, also declared he wanted the still-adolescent cub to stay in the )Tj
T*(capital.[35] )Tj
T*( Disputes between the two zoos continued into 2009. On 19 May, the Berlin Zoo )Tj
T*(offered to buy Knut from Neum√ºnster and therefore negate their financial claim )Tj
T*(on the two-year-old polar bear. Although Neum√ºnster Zoo set a price of )Tj
T*(‚Ç¨700,000, the Berlin Zoo stated that they would not pay "a cent more" than )Tj
T*(‚Ç¨350,000 \($488,145\).[36] On 8 July, the Berlin Zoo agreed to pay ‚Ç¨430,000 )Tj
T*(\($599,721\) to keep Knut in Berlin.[37] )Tj
T*( Giovanna, a female polar bear roughly the same age as Knut, was relocated to )Tj
T*(Berlin from Munich's Hellabrunn Animal Garden in September 2009. She was )Tj
T*(presented to the public on 23 September, and was due to briefly share Knut's )Tj
T*(enclosure while her regular home in Munich underwent repairs.[38] Her arrival )Tj
T*(sparked international interest, as many sources mused that the two bears )Tj
T*(\(although sexually immature\) would soon be "dating".[39] However, in March )Tj
T*(2010, the German chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called )Tj
T*(for Knut to be castrated in order to avoid inbreeding; he and Giovanna share a )Tj
T*(grandfather and, according to PETA spokesman Frank Albrecht, the same animal )Tj
T*(rights activist who spoke out about Knut's handraising three years earlier, )Tj
T*(their offspring would threaten the genetic diversity of the German polar bear )Tj
T*(population.[40] The Berlin Zoo declined to comment on the matter, only noting )Tj
T*(that Giovanna's stay in Berlin was still temporary.[41] In August 2010, )Tj
T*(Giovanna was moved back to Munich after repairs on her enclosure were )Tj
T*(completed.[42] )Tj
T*( Until his death, Knut shared an enclosure with three female polar bears: )Tj
T*(Nancy, Katjuscha and his mother Tosca. The older bears were reportedly )Tj
T*(aggressive towards the young male bear, causing news reports in late 2010 to )Tj
T*(question whether Knut was being bullied.[43] One of the zookeepers disagreed, )Tj
T*(stating publicly that "For the time being, Knut is not yet an adult male and )Tj
T*(doesn't yet know how to get respect like his father did. But day by day, he is )Tj
T*(imposing himself and with time, this type of problem will go away."[44] )Tj
T*( On 19 March 2011, at the age of four, Knut collapsed and died in his )Tj
T*(enclosure.[45] Witnesses reported that after the bear's rear left leg began )Tj
T*(shaking, he became agitated before convulsing several times and falling )Tj
T*(backwards into the pool.[46] Approximately 600 to 700 zoo visitors witnessed )Tj
T*(Knut's death.[47] A statement made on 22 March in relation to the necropsy )Tj
T*(reported there were "significant changes in the brain, which may be regarded as )Tj
T*(a reason for the sudden death".[48] Animal welfare organizations in Germany )Tj
T*(initially accused the Berlin Zoo of negligence, claiming that Knut died of )Tj
T*(stress caused by being forced to share his enclosure with three female polar )Tj
T*(bears.[46] The Zoo denied such claims. Bear curator Heiner Kl√∂s stated they )Tj
T*("did everything to look after Knut‚Äîit's normal for polar bears to live with )Tj
T*(other polar bears in a zoo, and the idea was that Knut should learn social )Tj
T*(behavior and other skills from the older females ... He played with the other )Tj
T*(bears, he was relaxed and strong".[49] )Tj

T*(was from drowning. The bear's apparent seizure was due to his suffering from )Tj
T*(encephalitis, a swelling of the brain likely triggered by an infection.[50] It )Tj
T*(is unknown what infection caused the swelling, but pathologists believe it was )Tj
T*(a virus. Although Knut showed no symptoms of being ill, pathologists believe )Tj
T*(that "this suspected infection must already have been there for a long time ... )Tj
T*(at least several weeks, possibly months".[50] It was also announced that had )Tj
T*(Knut not drowned after collapsing, he would not have survived the encephalitis. )Tj
T*( Knut's sudden death caused an international outpouring of grief. Hundreds of )Tj
T*(fans visited the zoo after the bear's death, leaving flowers and mementos near )Tj
T*(the enclosure.[51] The mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, stated "We all held him )Tj
T*(so dearly. He was the star of the Berlin zoos".[52][53] The Zoo plans to erect )Tj
T*(a monument in Knut's honor, financed by donations from fans. Thomas Ziolko, the )Tj
T*(chairman of the Friends of the Berlin Zoo, was quoted as saying "Knut will live )Tj
T*(on in the hearts of many visitors, but it's important to create a memorial for )Tj
T*(coming generations to preserve the memory of this unique animal )Tj
T*(personality."[46] Knut's remains may also be stuffed and put on display in )Tj
T*(Berlin's Museum of Natural History, although this decision has caused some )Tj
T*(controversy with fans.[54][55] On 17 January 2012, the Berlin Zoo announced )Tj
T*(that Knut would be immortalized in a bronze sculpture by Ukrainian artist Josef )Tj
T*(Tabachnyk. "Knut ‚Äì The Dreamer", which shows the bear "stretching out dreamily )Tj
T*(on a rock", was the winner among 40 other entries in a competition held by the )Tj
T*(zoo.[56] )Tj
T*( [edit] Effects of popularity )Tj
T*( [edit] Commercial success )Tj
T*( The Berlin Zoo registered "Knut" as a trademark in late March 2007. As a )Tj
T*(result, its shares more than doubled at the Berlin Stock Exchange; previously )Tj
T*(worth around ‚Ç¨2,000, the value closed at ‚Ç¨4,820 just a week later.[57] The zoo )Tj
T*(reported that its attendance figures for 2007 increased by an estimated 30 )Tj
T*(percent, making it the most profitable it had been in its 163 year history.[2] )Tj
T*(Knut earned the Berlin Zoo nearly ‚Ç¨5 million that year, mainly thanks to an )Tj
T*(increase in visitors as well as the amount of merchandise sold.[58] )Tj
T*( Various companies profited from the attention surrounding Knut by developing )Tj
T*(themed products such as ringtones and cuddly toys.[59] Plush toy company Steiff )Tj
T*(produced several Knut-based plush toys in three sizes and models: sitting, )Tj
T*(standing, and lying down. The first 2,400 produced toys, which sold exclusively )Tj
T*(at the Berlin Zoo, sold out in only four days.[2] The money raised from the )Tj
T*(Steiff deal was intended to be used to renovate the polar bear enclosure at the )Tj
T*(zoo.[60] Candy company Haribo released a raspberry-flavored gummy bear sweet )Tj
T*(called Cuddly Knut beginning in April 2007. They pledged to donate ten cents to )Tj
T*(the zoo for every tub of Knut sweets it sold. The gummy bears sold so well that )Tj
T*(the Bonn-based company had to expand production to a second factory to deal )Tj
T*(with demand.[61] )Tj
T*( Knut was the subject of several popular songs in Germany, the most successful )Tj
T*(of which were the singles "Knut is Cute" and "Knut, der kleine Eisb√§r" )Tj
T*(\(English: "Knut, the little polar bear"\) by nine-year-old Kitty from )Tj
T*(K√∂penick.[62][63] In Britain, musical comedian Mitch Benn has performed four )Tj
T*(songs about Knut for BBC Radio 4 satirical series The Now Show: "The Baby Bear )Tj
T*(Must DIE!",[64] "Knut Isn't Cute Anymore",[65] "Goodbye Knut"[66] and "Panda in )Tj
T*(Berlin".[67] A blog with updates about the polar bear was maintained by a )Tj
T*(journalist at the regional public broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg; it )Tj
T*(was available in German, English, and Spanish. RBB was also responsible for a )Tj
T*(weekly television program dedicated to the polar bear cub that was broadcast in )Tj
T*(Germany. Knut has also been the subject of several DVDs,[68] including one )Tj
T*(entitled "Knut ‚Äì Stories from a Polar Bear's Nursery". He appeared on the 29 )Tj
T*(March 2007 cover of the German Vanity Fair magazine, which included a several )Tj

T*(story as well as previously unpublished photographs.[69] Although several books )Tj

T*(the same year.[70] Rights to the book have also been sold to publishers in )Tj
T*(Japan, England, Mexico, China, and Italy. )Tj
T*( On 31 December 2007, the zoo's director confirmed the zoo had received a )Tj
T*(proposal for a film deal from Hollywood film producer Ash R. Shah, whose films )Tj
T*(include Supernova and Shark Bait, to make an animated film about the bear's )Tj
T*(life.[71] Shah reportedly approached the Berlin Zoo with a purported ‚Ç¨3.5 )Tj

T*(und seine Freunde \(Knut and His Friends\), which premiered in Berlin on 2 March )Tj
T*(2008.[73] Directed by Michael Johnson, the film depicts how Knut was rescued )Tj

T*(threatening, scolding way."[74] As a result, the German Environment Minister )Tj
T*(Sigmar Gabriel officially adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference on )Tj
T*(endangered species to be held in Bonn in 2008.[74] The minister met with Knut )Tj
T*(soon after his zoo debut, commenting that although Knut was in safe hands, )Tj
T*("worldwide polar bears are in danger and if Knut can help the cause, then that )Tj
T*(is a good thing."[14] )Tj
T*( Photographer Annie Leibovitz took pictures of Knut that were used for an )Tj
T*(environmental campaign, including Vanity Fair magazine's May 2007 Green Issue )Tj
T*(in which he was superimposed into a photograph with American actor Leonardo )Tj
T*(DiCaprio.[75] The polar bear has also been depicted on the logo for the German )Tj
T*(Environment Minister's campaign to help stop global warming[27] and a 2008 )Tj
T*(special issue stamp. Officially released on 9 April, the stamp shows the )Tj
T*(roughly one-year-old Knut with the slogan "Natur weltweit bewahren" \("Preserve )Tj
T*(nature worldwide"\).[58] )Tj

T*( Lost: Missing Pieces is a series of thirteen video clips ranging in length )Tj
T*(from one to four minutes that aired during the hiatus between the 3rd and 4th )Tj
T*(seasons of the television show Lost, from which the series is spun off.[1] They )Tj
T*(generally became available to Verizon Wireless users on Mondays from November )Tj
T*(2007 to January 2008 and were uploaded onto the ABC's website a week later for )Tj
T*(free streaming.[2] The "mobisodes", which have also been referred to as )Tj
T*("webisodes", were shot in Honolulu, Hawaii, and produced by the same crew with )Tj
T*(the same cast as the television series; thus, all content is considered to be )Tj
T*(canonical.[3]Lost: Missing Pieces were included as special features in the )Tj
T*(fourth season's 2008 DVD releases.[4] )Tj
T*( The project was announced in November 2005 as the Lost Video Diaries; however, )Tj
T*(production was delayed several times due to contractual restrictions. Lost's )Tj
T*(writer-producers originally proposed the mobisodes as a self-contained story )Tj
T*(that would focus on two previously unseen characters of the Lost fictional )Tj
T*(universe. These characters would be played by actors who were not part of the )Tj
T*(Screen Actors Guild; however the entertainment guilds refused to support such a )Tj
T*(project. After months of unsuccessful negotiating, the series was seemingly )Tj
T*(shelved by ABC. In June 2007, it was announced that the mobisodes, which would )Tj
T*(be renamed Lost: Missing Pieces, would star the regular characters of Lost in )Tj
T*(thirteen short video clips unrelated to each other.[5] Twelve scenes were newly )Tj
T*(shot; one was a deleted scene from the television series. Critical response to )Tj
T*(Lost: Missing Pieces was mixed. The series was nominated for an Emmy Award in )Tj

T*( [edit] Conception )Tj
T*( In November 2005, while the early second season of Lost was airing, The )Tj
T*(Hollywood Reporter reported that twenty-two mobisodes‚Äîeach spanning several )Tj
T*(minutes‚Äîwere expected to be produced in December for a January 2006 release.[6] )Tj
T*(Zap2it reported that they would later be present on the second season's DVD set )Tj
T*(and that six would be exclusive to the DVD.[7] Unlike the television series, it )Tj
T*(would not be produced by ABC Studios \(known then as "Touchstone Television"\) )Tj
T*(and would star non-Screen Actors Guild members; however it would be produced )Tj
T*(under the oversight of Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, like the television )Tj
T*(series.[8] In response to fan inquiries about Lost's thirty-odd background )Tj
T*(characters, the Lost Video Diaries would focus on a self-contained story about )Tj
T*(two survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight¬†815 who had not previously been )Tj
T*(introduced.[9] The Los Angeles Times confirmed in January 2006‚Äìthe month )Tj
T*(originally scheduled to launch the series[10]‚Äìthat the mobisodes would be )Tj
T*(originally broadcast on V CAST from Verizon Wireless and that each mobisode )Tj
T*(would span only two minutes.[11] Verizon would ultimately pay ABC $400,000 for )Tj
T*(the mobisodes.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Postponement )Tj
T*( Production was delayed when the actors, directors and writers guilds refused )Tj
T*(to support the spin-off. A deal previously unheard of was negotiated in )Tj
T*(April,[13] which allowed guild members involved to collect residuals.[14] This )Tj
T*(agreement prompted Lindelof and Cuse to develop a storyline for the Video )Tj
T*(Diaries that would include Lost's regular characters, although not all of )Tj
T*(Lost's regular cast signed contracts. According to Touchstone's executive vice )Tj
T*(president for production Barry Jossen, who would eventually serve as an )Tj
T*(executive producer on the mobisodes, "They seem to be under the impression that )Tj
T*(we'll make millions of dollars and they won't".[12]Variety reported that the )Tj
T*(mobisodes would be produced and aired alongside the third season of Lost.[15] )Tj
T*(At Comic-Con International in July, Lindelof and Cuse announced that only )Tj
T*(thirteen mobisodes would be produced. They would run during the third season's )Tj
T*(winter hiatus, with none saved exclusively for the third season's DVD set.[16] )Tj
T*(A sneak peek of the Video Diaries was also shown at Comic-Con. The new premise )Tj
T*(featured Hurley Reyes \(played by Jorge Garcia\) finding a functional Dharma )Tj
T*(Initiative video camcorder[17] that had Dharma orientation films on it.[18] In )Tj
T*(the clip, he films Kate Austen \(Evangeline Lilly\) and James "Sawyer" Ford \(Josh )Tj
T*(Holloway\).[19] During the hiatus, no mobisodes were to be found and clips from )Tj
T*(upcoming episodes called Lost Moments aired instead, on television and then )Tj
T*(ABC.com.[20] In January 2007, Wizard discovered that ABC was still negotiating )Tj
T*(the actors' contracts; thus, no mobisodes had been produced, aside from the )Tj
T*(Comic-Con teaser.[21] In February, Lost's script coordinator, responding to a )Tj
T*(fan question, suspected the mobisodes had seemingly been put on hold )Tj
T*(indefinitely due to an inability to reach a contract agreement.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] Revamp )Tj
T*( In June, Lindelof and Cuse were interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter and they )Tj
T*(revealed the ultimate plan for the mobisodes. The mobisodes would air during )Tj
T*(the hiatus between the third and fourth seasons and would give viewers )Tj
T*(interesting information that would probably not be found in the show; the )Tj
T*(average mobisode would only be one and a half minutes long.[23] In the third )Tj
T*(season, the writers tried to integrate two previously unseen crash survivors )Tj
T*(named Nikki Fernandez \(Kiele Sanchez\) and Paulo \(Rodrigo Santoro\) into the )Tj
T*(story, but the pair was negatively received for their abrupt appearance and the )Tj
T*(writers killed them off after seven appearances.[24] Lindelof and Cuse learned )Tj
T*(from their mistake and decided that the mobisodes would focus on the regular )Tj
T*(Lost cast.[25] The writers were paid $800 per mobisode, whereas the actors )Tj
T*(received $425 per mobisode. Actors were contracted to receive more money if the )Tj
T*(mobisode were reused in another medium.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Release )Tj
T*( In regard to writing, co-executive producer Edward Kitsis said that "sometimes )Tj
T*(it was a scene we always wanted to do, a scene that never got shot, sometimes )Tj
T*(it was just something interesting".[26] "Buried Secrets" revisits the first )Tj

T*(season storylines of sexual tension between Sun-Hwa Kwon \(Yunjin Kim\) and )Tj
T*(Michael Dawson \(Harold Perrineau\) and the mutual detestation between Sun's )Tj
T*(husband Jin \(Daniel Dae Kim\) and Michael.[27] These conflicts were going to be )Tj
T*(further explored in the first season; however, positive fan reaction to Sun and )Tj
T*(Jin as a couple and good chemistry between the actors playing Michael and Jin )Tj
T*(led to the abandonment of the love triangle.[28]Reuters announced in November )Tj
T*(that the mobisodes would premiere that month.[29] This proved to be true, with )Tj
T*("The Watch" appearing suddenly to Verizon customers as the first of the Lost: )Tj
T*(Missing Pieces. A new mobisode would generally become available each Monday and )Tj
T*(would be released a week later as a free webisode on ABC's website. The Writers )Tj
T*(Guild of America strike occurred as the mobisodes were released, due to )Tj
T*(television writers wanting a deal similar to that achieved for Missing )Tj
T*(Pieces.[30] Filming was completed in late November.[31] The mobisodes were )Tj
T*(later released as special features on the DVD and Blu-ray sets of Lost: The )Tj
T*(Complete Fourth Season¬†‚Äì The Expanded Experience in the second half of 2008. )Tj
T*( Although it had not always been the plan,[32] the Missing Pieces were produced )Tj
T*(by ABC Studios. Executive producer Jack Bender directed each mobisode, with )Tj
T*(writing duties divided between executive producers Lindelof and Cuse,[33][34] )Tj
T*(supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff,[35] co-producer Brian K. Vaughan,[36] )Tj
T*(executive story editor Christina M. Kim,[37] and co-executive producers Drew )Tj
T*(Goddard, Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz.[38][39][39] Other crew members )Tj
T*(included executive producer Bryan Burk of post-production and co-executive )Tj
T*(producer Jean Higgins of physical production. "The Envelope"‚Äîa deleted scene )Tj
T*(from the third season premiere; the only mobisode not to be originally filmed )Tj
T*(and written for Lost: Missing Pieces[40]‚Äîcontained additional credits: Jeff )Tj
T*(Pinkner is an executive producer and executive producer J. J. Abrams is a )Tj
T*(co-writer.[41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cast and characters )Tj
T*( The Missing Pieces retained many of the cast members from the television )Tj
T*(series. Perrineau plays Michael,[42] who had not been seen since the second )Tj
T*(season.[43]Matthew Fox plays Jack Shephard,[44] the leader of the castaways and )Tj
T*(Elizabeth Mitchell portrays his love interest, Juliet Burke.[42] Garcia )Tj
T*(reprises his role as crash survivor Hurley.[45] Kim and Kim play married couple )Tj
T*(Jin and Sun.[37]Michael Emerson acts as Ben Linus, the leader of the island )Tj
T*(residents known as the "Others".[44] Guest stars John Terry,[46]Daniel )Tj
T*(Roebuck,[47]William Mapother[48] and Julie Adams[41] reprise their roles of )Tj
T*(Christian Shephard, Leslie Arzt, Ethan Rom and Amelia, respectively. Emilie de )Tj
T*(Ravin, who plays Claire Littleton, appears solely in archived footage from the )Tj
T*(television show.[33]Vincent, a dog who survived the plane crash, is played by )Tj
T*(the dog Pono.[49] Guest star Sean Whalen makes his first appearance as the )Tj
T*(crash survivor Neil "Frogurt".[39] While the second season was airing, the )Tj
T*(writer-producers confirmed in the April 3, 2006 edition of the Official Lost )Tj
T*(Podcast that Frogurt would appear in the late second season,[50] however, he )Tj
T*(was merely mentioned once.[51] Frogurt also did not appear in the third season )Tj
T*(and he became a running gag in the podcast,[52] with Lindelof and Cuse )Tj
T*(repeatedly claiming that Frogurt would appear in the show.[53][54] However, )Tj
T*(Frogurt did appear in the fifth season briefly, but was shot through with )Tj
T*(flaming arrows shortly after being introduced.[55] )Tj
T*( [edit] Mobisodes )Tj
T*( "Prod. no." is short for "production code number", which signifies the order )Tj
T*(that the mobisodes were produced in and appear on DVD and Blu-ray, which is )Tj
T*(different from the order that they aired in. "Original air date" refers to the )Tj
T*(original V CAST airdate. Days are in relation to the day of the crash, which is )Tj
T*(day 1 and September 22, 2004. All mobisodes are newly written and shot,[3] with )Tj
T*(the exception of "The Envelope", which is a deleted scene from "A Tale of Two )Tj
T*(Cities" that was shot on August 9 and 11, 2006,[56] a year before the other )Tj

T*(Live-Action Entertainment Programs" category.[58] Executive producers Damon )Tj
T*(Lindelof, Carlton Cuse and Barry Jossen were successful in receiving a )Tj
T*(nomination on July 17, 2007;[59] however, they lost to SciFi's Battlestar )Tj
T*(Galactica: Razor Flashbacks on September 13 at the Creative Arts Emmy Award )Tj
T*(ceremony of the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards.[60] Douglas Durdan of the Richmond )Tj
T*(Times-Dispatch described "The Watch" "as unsatisfying as it is satisfying" )Tj
T*(because the reviewer was unsure of which lines were important or if there were )Tj
T*(any clues to future episodes hidden amongst the background.[61] After two )Tj
T*(mobisodes aired, UGO's Jon Lachonis wrote that "the [first two] mobisodes ... )Tj
T*(have most fans kvetching about the irrelevancy and down right Lost-lessness of )Tj
T*(the tidbits that are meant to traverse gaps in the story", "it's way too early )Tj
T*(to dismiss the mobisodes as a complete waste of time, as Lost has a long )Tj
T*(history of righting its own wrongs and the best may certainly be yet to come" )Tj
T*(and "[Frogurt is] the most annoying person on Lost's mystery island".[18] Four )Tj
T*(mobisodes later, UGO called them "impressive" and said that "they 'look' like )Tj
T*(full out productions".[62] Larry Dobrow of Advertising Age enjoyed the first )Tj
T*(six Lost: Missing Pieces, describing them as "all entertaining and )Tj
T*(professionally rendered" and calling the project "a great friggin' idea".[63] )Tj
T*(Josh Wigler of Wizard wrote that the Lost: Missing Pieces are "hit or miss in )Tj
T*(terms of quality and importance. Some episodes, however, shed some excellent )Tj
T*(light on Lost mythology. ... In terms of flat out fun, it doesn't get much )Tj
T*(better than 'Jin has a Temper-Tantrum on the Golf Course' ... featuring a )Tj
T*(frustrated Jin screaming to the high heavens after botching an easy putt )Tj
T*(against Michael. Unnecessary, yes. Hysterical, absolutely."[64] )Tj
T*( MSNBC's Ree Hines reviewed the first seven Missing Pieces.[65] He wrote that )Tj
T*("'The Watch' is basically pointless", "the humor [of 'The Adventures of Hurley )Tj
T*(and Frogurt'] doesn't work" and "Operation: Sleeper" was deemed "the most )Tj
T*(useless of the webisodes".[65] Hines said that "King of the Castle" "almost )Tj
T*(satisfies ... due to ... Ben's deadpan dastardly presence" and "Room 23" is the )Tj
T*(most promising of the first half of the series.[65] Hines concluded that "the )Tj
T*(creators fill gaps that don't need filling. The installments fail to form a )Tj
T*(cohesive stand-alone arc, leaving viewers with little more than a series of )Tj
T*(fragmented scenes, presumably no better than those left on the cutting-room )Tj
T*(floor."[65] )Tj
T*( Chris Carabott of IGN reviewed most of Lost: Missing Pieces and has given each )Tj
T*(a rating out of ten.[66] After four mobisodes aired, he remarked that "these )Tj
T*(vignettes feel like your average deleted scene‚Äîremoved for a good reason";[67] )Tj
T*(however, no mobisode received a score less than 6.5. "The Watch" scored a 7.5 )Tj
T*(and was called "touching" because Jack and his father have rarely been seen )Tj
T*(getting along in Lost.[68] "The Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt" was given a )Tj
T*(6.5 and described as "a funny little moment" and "tragic", in regard to Libby's )Tj
T*(death.[69] "King of the Castle" received an 8.5. Carabott said that it was )Tj
T*(well-written, "a great performance from [Fox and Emerson]" and worthy of )Tj
T*(appearing on television.[70] Carabott celebrated Michael's return in "The )Tj
T*(Deal", but the reviewer noted that "The Deal" "doesn't reveal anything new or )Tj
T*(exciting at all".[67] "Operation: Sleeper" was rated as a 7.5,[71] as was )Tj
T*("Buried Secrets".[72] "Room 23" got an 8 and was described as "definitely the )Tj
T*(type of new content that we are looking for. It's something that won't be )Tj
T*(missed by regular viewers but gives a little more insight into the nature of )Tj
T*(events on the island".[73] "Arzt and Crafts" also got an 8 and was said to have )Tj
T*("a cleverly devised title" and was "packed with a healthy amount of humor".[74] )Tj
T*("Tropical Depression" received an 8.5, with Carabott calling it "rather )Tj
T*(pointless ... but cute nonetheless".[75] "Jack, Meet Ethan. Ethan? Jack" scored )Tj
T*(an 8 and Mapother's acting skills were commended.[76] "Jin Has a Temper-Tantrum )Tj
T*(on the Golf Course" was deemed "hilarious" and "one of [Lost's] funniest ... )Tj
T*(moments" and worthy of a 7.5.[77] "The Envelope" was given a 6.5,[78] and "So )Tj

T*(Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt" was thought to be better than "The )Tj
T*(Watch".[81] "King of the Castle" was reviewed better than the previous two )Tj
T*(mobisodes and the reviewer noted that "it's a testament to ... Fox and ... )Tj
T*(Emerson's acting abilities that [it] is so intense".[82] "The Deal" was said to )Tj
T*(be even better than "King of the Castle".[83] While Dahl "always like[s] what )Tj
T*(Juliet brings to the table", he thought that "Operation: Sleeper" "serves )Tj
T*(little purpose".[84] "Room 23" was called the "best mobisode ever".[85] In )Tj
T*(regard to "Arzt and Crafts", Dahl wrote that "Lindelof wrote this mobisode ... )Tj
T*(and as a result ... it has the best dialogue of any mobisode so far".[86] He )Tj
T*(commented that "Tropical Depression" is "not totally superfluous, though the )Tj
T*(new information isn't very enlightening".[87] Dahl "liked" "Jack, Meet Ethan. )Tj
T*(Ethan? Jack", but decided "that it's not [Lindelof]'s best work".[88] Dahl )Tj
T*(wrote that "Jin Has a Temper-Tantrum on the Golf Course" is "a nice little )Tj
T*(scene", but the reviewer pointed out an inaccuracy in the scene's golf )Tj
T*(gameplay.[89] When reviewing "The Envelope", Dahl wrote that "The people over )Tj
T*(at Lost have cheated a little bit ... [but] it's still a pretty cool deleted )Tj
T*(scene".[90] After seeing "So It Begins", Dahl was "not entirely sure what to )Tj
T*(think" because the reviewer liked "showing the moments before the pilot began" )Tj
T*(and "doing a mobisode from Vincent's perspective, but adding a )Tj
T*(supposed-to-be-dead Christian to the mix is confusing".[91] )Tj
T*( Ryan McGee of Zap2it also reviewed every mobisode. "The Watch" was described )Tj
T*(as "anticlimactic".[92] "The Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt" was described as )Tj
T*("a little ... lacking", but McGee wrote that "'King of the Castle' proves that )Tj
T*(brevity is the soul of awesome, with a tense, information-rich two-and-a-half )Tj
T*(minutes that tingled my Spidey-esque mythology sense the entire time".[93] "The )Tj
T*(Deal" was received less favourably than the previous installment[94] McGee )Tj
T*(wrote that "Room 23" was "short but sweet".[95] "Arzt and Crafts" was called "a )Tj
T*(weak-ish entry" and it was noted that "not everything Lost does turns into )Tj
T*(Dharma-laced gold, sadly".[96] "Buried Secrets" was described as mediocre.[97] )Tj
T*(In the review for "Tropical Depression", McGee commented that "It's just not )Tj
T*(good. At all." and compared its quality to the episode "Stranger in a Strange )Tj
T*(Land" and the character Paulo,[98] both of which were negatively received by )Tj
T*(fans and critics.[99] "Jack, Meet Ethan. Ethan? Jack" had "return[ed Lost: )Tj
T*(Missing Pieces] to compelling form", however the title was called "clunky".[97] )Tj
T*(After watching "So It Begins", McGee wrote that it is "a mobisode so vital, so )Tj
T*(important that I can't believe that ABC didn't bother to air this [online] )Tj
T*(before the start of Season 4".[100] )Tj

T*( Ambrose Rookwood \(c. 1578 ‚Äì 31¬†January 1606\) was a member of the failed 1605 )Tj
T*(Gunpowder Plot, a conspiracy to replace the Protestant King James I with a )Tj
T*(Catholic monarch. Rookwood was born into a wealthy family of Catholic )Tj
T*(recusants, and educated by Jesuits at Flanders. His older brother became a )Tj
T*(Franciscan, and his two younger brothers were ordained as Catholic priests. )Tj
T*(Rookwood, however, became a horse-breeder. He married the Catholic Elizabeth )Tj
T*(Tyrwhitt, and had at least two sons. )Tj
T*( He was enlisted into the plot in September 1605 by Robert Catesby, a religious )Tj
T*(zealot whose impatience with James's treatment of English Catholics had grown )Tj
T*(so severe that he conspired to blow up the House of Lords with gunpowder, )Tj
T*(killing the king and much of the Protestant hierarchy. With the other )Tj
T*(conspirators he had recruited, Catesby also planned to incite a rebellion in )Tj
T*(the Midlands, during which James's nine-year-old daughter Princess Elizabeth )Tj
T*(would be captured, and installed as titular queen. Rookwood's stable of fine )Tj
T*(horses was essential for the uprising to succeed. )Tj
T*( The explosion was planned to coincide with the State Opening of Parliament on )Tj
T*(5¬†November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the )Tj
T*(House of Lords, Guy Fawkes, was discovered there and arrested. Rookwood fled )Tj
T*(the city, and informed Catesby and the others of the plan's failure. Together )Tj
T*(the remaining conspirators rode to Holbeche House in Staffordshire, where on 8¬†)Tj
T*(November they were attacked by the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men. )Tj
T*(Catesby was killed, but Rookwood survived, and was imprisoned in the Tower of )Tj
T*(London. )Tj
T*( Rookwood and the survivors were arraigned on 27¬†January 1606 in Westminster )Tj
T*(Hall. Pleading not guilty, he claimed to have loved Catesby "above any worldly )Tj
T*(man". His subsequent request for mercy was ignored, however, and he was hanged, )Tj
T*(drawn and quartered on 31¬†January, in the Old Palace Yard at Westminster. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Born sometime about 1578, Ambrose Rookwood was the second of four sons born to )Tj
T*(Robert Rookwood and his second wife, Dorothea. During his first marriage to )Tj
T*(Bridget Kemp, Robert had sired four sons, but all predeceased their father.[1] )Tj
T*( The Rookwood family had lived at Stanningfield in Suffolk for 300¬†years. )Tj
T*(Wealthy, and staunch Catholics, the authorities viewed them as trouble-makers. )Tj
T*(Ambrose's Papist cousin Edward had spent ten years in prison for his faith, but )Tj
T*(in 1578 he entertained Queen Elizabeth¬†I at his home, Euston Hall. It was an )Tj
T*(expensive visit that made a serious dent in the family's finances, and which )Tj
T*(neutered their influence for years thereafter.[2] Ambrose's parents had been )Tj
T*(imprisoned for their recusancy,[3] and he was indicted on the same charge in )Tj
T*(February 1605. However, he was apparently happy to advertise his faith; in the )Tj
T*(summer of 1605 he commissioned a London cutler, John Craddock, to place a )Tj
T*(Spanish blade into a sword hilt engraved with the story of the Passion of )Tj
T*(Christ. As such weapons were generally worn in public, it was "a potentially )Tj
T*(dangerous statement of faith".[4][nb 1] )Tj
T*( Ambrose and two of his brothers, Robert and Christopher, were educated by )Tj
T*(Jesuits at Saint-Omer, then in Flanders.[nb 2] Both brothers became priests )Tj
T*(\(Ambrose's elder brother, Henry, became a Franciscan\),[6] and his half-sisters )Tj
T*(Dorothea and Susanna became nuns.[3] Ambrose married into the Tyrwhitts, a )Tj
T*(prominent family of Catholics from Kettleby in Lincolnshire, and with his wife )Tj
T*(Elizabeth \(cousin to Robert Keyes\)[7] had at least two sons, Robert and Henry. )Tj

T*(According to the Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, Rookwood was "well-built and handsome, )Tj
T*(if somewhat short",[1][8] which he compensated for by his taste in extravagant )Tj
T*(clothing. In author Antonia Fraser's opinion, this affectation was somewhat )Tj
T*(inappropriate at a time when "clothes were supposed to denote rank rather than )Tj
T*(money".[9] On his father's death in 1600, Rookwood inherited Coldham Hall, )Tj
T*(which subsequently became a refuge for priests.[3] The following year he joined )Tj
T*(the Earl of Essex's abortive rebellion against the government, for which he was )Tj
T*(captured and held at Newgate Prison.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Enlisted )Tj
T*( In August 1605 Rookwood joined the Jesuits Henry Garnet and John Gerard on a )Tj
T*(pilgrimage to the shrine of St Winefride's Well in Holywell.[11] Late in )Tj
T*(September,[12] he was approached by Robert Catesby, Thomas Wintour and John )Tj
T*(Wright, and invited to join what became known as the Gunpowder Plot.[1] English )Tj
T*(Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when James I )Tj
T*(came to the throne, as his attitude appeared to be moderate, even tolerant )Tj
T*(towards Catholics. In Catesby's view however, James had reneged on his )Tj
T*(promises.[13][14] He therefore planned to kill the king by blowing up the House )Tj
T*(of Lords with gunpowder, and then inciting a popular revolt to install James's )Tj
T*(daughter, Princess Elizabeth, as titular Queen.[15] To this end he had already )Tj
T*(helped enlist nine Catholics into the conspiracy, but was running out of money )Tj
T*(and needed to recruit more men. Rookwood was a horse-breeder, and his stable of )Tj
T*(fine mounts at Coldham Hall was needed for the Midlands uprising.[16] He had )Tj
T*(been asked to supply them with gunpowder about a year earlier, under the )Tj
T*(pretence that it was for William Stanley's regiment in Flanders‚Äîno longer an )Tj
T*(illegal operation due to the recent Treaty of London[7]‚Äîbut otherwise provided )Tj
T*(no funds for the conspiracy.[16] )Tj
T*( Although unverifiable, his wife's relationship to Robert Keyes may mean that )Tj
T*(Rookwood already suspected that something was being planned.[3] He was at first )Tj
T*(concerned for the welfare of the Catholic lords who would be present at the )Tj
T*(explosion, but his compunction was alleviated when Catesby promised him that )Tj
T*(they would be tricked out of attending Parliament that day. Any lingering )Tj
T*(doubts Rookwood had were removed by Catesby's lie that the Jesuits had given )Tj
T*(the scheme their approval.[6] Rookwood had stayed with the Wintours at )Tj
T*(Huddington Court, and that month with the Catholic Lacons at Kinlet )Tj
T*(Hall,[12][17] but at Cateby's behest he rented Clopton House near Stratford, )Tj
T*(and moved there after Michaelmas. He took with him several Catholic religious )Tj
T*(symbols, such as chalices, crucifixes, vestments, Latin books and praying )Tj
T*(beads. These were concealed in a cellar built by the Jesuit Nicholas Owen.[18] )Tj
T*( Toward the end of October he joined Keyes at his lodgings in London.[19] A few )Tj
T*(days before the planned explosion he changed his mind about the sword he had )Tj
T*(ordered John Craddock to make, and had the cutler replace the grip with a gold )Tj
T*(one. The modified sword, which in total probably cost Rookwood more than ¬£20, )Tj
T*(was delivered on 4¬†November.[4][20] )Tj
T*( [edit] Discovery )Tj
T*( The existence of the plot had been revealed in an anonymous letter delivered )Tj
T*(ten days earlier to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to keep )Tj
T*(away from Parliament. On the evening of 4¬†November the authorities made a )Tj
T*(search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy )Tj
T*(Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. He was immediately arrested.[21] )Tj
T*( Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was )Tj
T*(therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the )Tj
T*(government. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread through London, prompting )Tj
T*(Christopher Wright \(brother of John\) to rush to Thomas Wintour, and tell what )Tj
T*(had happened. Wintour guessed that the government was looking for Percy, and )Tj
T*(told Wright to travel to Percy's lodgings and "bid him begone". While Wintour )Tj
T*(lingered, Christopher Wright and Percy left the city, followed by Keyes, and )Tj
T*(then Rookwood. A renowned horseman, Rookwood covered 30¬†miles in two¬†hours on a )Tj
T*(single horse. Using various steeds he had left along the route, he passed Keyes )Tj
T*(at Highgate, and then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill near Dunstable. He )Tj
T*(caught up with Catesby, who had left the previous day to prepare the uprising, )Tj

T*(Catesby, his servant Thomas Bates, both Wright brothers, Percy and Rookwood, )Tj
T*(rode on to Dunchurch.[22] )Tj
T*( While Fawkes was being tortured, on 6¬†November the government began to round )Tj
T*(up anyone they thought might be involved. Rookwood's servants, still in the )Tj
T*(house their master had so hastily departed, were questioned on the same day. )Tj
T*(His belongings at Clopton‚Äîincluding several incriminating Catholic symbols‚Äîwere )Tj
T*(also taken, and by the time the plotters had reached Catesby's family home at )Tj
T*(Ashby St Ledgers, Rookwood's name was among the list of suspects drawn up by )Tj
T*(the Lord Chief Justice. The fugitives continued on to Dunchurch, where they met )Tj
T*(the recently-recruited conspirator Everard Digby, with his hunting party.[23] )Tj
T*(The next day the group stole horses from Warwick Castle, although with his fine )Tj
T*(cort√®ge, Rookwood avoided the town. They then collected stored weapons from )Tj
T*(Norbrook, and continued on to Huddington. The party tried in vain to expand )Tj
T*(their number, but were shunned; no one was prepared to risk being labelled a )Tj
T*(traitor. Father Garnet, contacted at Coughton Court by Bates, wrote Catesby a )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( Rookwood was proclaimed a wanted man on 7¬†November. He went to confession and )Tj
T*(with the rest of the group took the sacrament‚Äîin Fraser's opinion, a sign that )Tj
T*(none of them thought they had long to live. Through pouring rain they rode to )Tj
T*(Hewell Grange, helping themselves to further arms, ammunition and money, and )Tj
T*(finally reached Holbeche House, on the border of Staffordshire, at about 10:00¬†)Tj
T*(pm that night. Tired from three days of riding, they spread in front of the )Tj
T*(fire some of the now-soaked gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange, to dry out. A )Tj
T*(stray spark landed on the powder, and Rookwood, Catesby, John Grant and another )Tj
T*(man were caught up in the resultant conflagration. Rookwood and Catesby were )Tj
T*(described as "reasonably well", but Grant was blinded.[24] )Tj
T*( Several of the conspirators disappeared into the night, but Rookwood, Catesby, )Tj
T*(the Wright brothers, Percy and Grant stayed on.[26] They didn't have long to )Tj
T*(wait; by 11:00¬†am the next day the house was surrounded by 200¬†of the Sheriff )Tj
T*(of Worcester's men. In the ensuing battle, Wintour was shot in the shoulder. )Tj
T*(John and Christopher Wright were each killed. Catesby and Percy were reportedly )Tj
T*(both killed by a single musket ball. Rookwood was also shot, but survived and )Tj
T*(was quickly captured.[26] His belongings should by right have been seized by )Tj
T*(the government, but his elaborate sword apparently proved to be too great a )Tj
T*(temptation for the Sheriff's men, and disappeared without trace.[27] Rookwood )Tj

T*( Suillus pungens, commonly known as the pungent slippery Jack or the pungent )Tj
T*(Suillus, is a species of fungus in the genus Suillus. The fruit bodies of the )Tj
T*(fungus have slimy convex caps up to 14¬†cm \(5.5¬†in\) wide. The mushroom is )Tj
T*(characterized by the very distinct color changes that occur in the cap )Tj
T*(throughout development. Typically, the young cap is whitish, later becoming )Tj
T*(grayish-olive to reddish-brown or a mottled combination of these colors. The )Tj
T*(mushroom has a dotted stem up to 7¬†cm \(2.8¬†in\) long, and 2¬†cm \(0.8¬†in\) thick. )Tj
T*(On the underside on the cap is the spore-bearing tissue consisting of minute )Tj
T*(vertically arranged tubes that appear as a surface of angular, yellowish pores. )Tj
T*(The presence of milky droplets on the pore surface of young individuals, )Tj
T*(especially in humid environments, is a characteristic feature of this species. )Tj
T*(S.¬†pungens can usually be distinguished from other similar Suillus species by )Tj
T*(differences in distribution, odor and taste. The mushroom is considered edible, )Tj
T*(but not highly regarded. )Tj
T*( An ectomycorrhizal species, S.¬†pungens forms an intimate mutualistic )Tj
T*(relationship between its underground mycelium and the young roots of the )Tj
T*(associated host tree. The fungus‚Äîlimited in distribution to California‚Äîfruits )Tj
T*(almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and )Tj
T*(scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. )Tj
T*(Several studies have investigated the role of S.¬†pungens in the coastal )Tj
T*(Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more )Tj
T*(fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, )Tj
T*(it is not a dominant root colonizer, and occupies only a small percentage of )Tj
T*(ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically )Tj
T*(despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently )Tj
T*(transfer nutrients from its host for its own use. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy, classification, and phylogeny )Tj
T*( The fungus was first described scientifically by American mycologists Harry D. )Tj
T*(Thiers and Alexander H. Smith in their 1964 monograph on North American Suillus )Tj
T*(species. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State )Tj
T*(University in San Francisco.[1] Smith and Thiers classified S.¬†pungens in )Tj
T*(section Suilli‚Äîa grouping of related species characterized by the presence of )Tj
T*(either a ring on the stem, a partial veil adhering to the cap margin, or a )Tj
T*("false veil" not attached to the stem but initially covering the tube )Tj
T*(cavity.[2] )Tj
T*( A 1996 molecular analysis of 38 different Suillus species used the sequences )Tj
T*(of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and )Tj
T*(clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The results suggest that S.¬†pungens was )Tj
T*(genetically similar to S.¬†collinitus, S.¬†neoalbidipes, S.¬†pseudobrevipes, S.¬†)Tj
T*(luteus, S.¬†brevipes, S.¬†weaverae, and certain isolates of S.¬†granulatus.[3] )Tj
T*( The specific epithet is derived from the Latin pungens,[4] and refers to the )Tj
T*(pungent aroma of the fruit bodies. The mushroom is commonly known as the )Tj
T*("pungent slippy Jack"[5] or the "pungent Suillus".[6] It has also been referred )Tj
T*(to as the "slippery Jack"[7] a common name applied to several Suillus species. )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The cap of S.¬†pungens is roughly convex when young, becoming plano-convex )Tj
T*(\(flat on one side and rounded on the other\) to somewhat flat with age, and )Tj
T*(reaches diameters of 4‚Äì14¬†cm \(1.6‚Äì5.5¬†in\). The cap surface is sticky to slimy )Tj
T*(when moist, becoming shiny when dried. The surface is smooth but is sometimes )Tj

T*(streaked with the sticky glue-like cap slime when older. The cap color is )Tj
T*(highly variable in this species, and the cap is often variegated with a mixture )Tj
T*(of light and dark colors. When young it is dirty-white to olive with pale olive )Tj
T*(splotches. Maturing caps can retain the color they had when young, or become )Tj
T*(tawny to orange-yellow to reddish-brown, or a combination of these colors.[6] )Tj
T*(The cap margin is initially rolled inward and has a cottony roll of white )Tj
T*(tissue, but becomes naked and curves downward with age. The flesh is 1‚Äì2¬†cm )Tj
T*(\(0.4‚Äì0.8¬†in\) thick, white and unchanging in young fruit bodies, frequently )Tj
T*(changing to yellow when older.[1] )Tj
T*( The tubes that comprise the hymenium \(spore-bearing tissue\) on the underside )Tj
T*(of the cap are up to 1¬†cm \(0.4¬†in\) long, adnate when young, becoming decurrent )Tj
T*(or nearly so with age. In young specimens, they are whitish to pale buff, and )Tj
T*(are covered with milky droplets that become brown to ochraceous when dried. As )Tj
T*(specimens mature the color of the pore surface changes to yellowish, and )Tj
T*(finally to dark yellow. The angular pores, which are 1‚Äì1.5¬†mm in diameter, are )Tj
T*(not radially arranged, and do not change color when bruised.[1] The stem is )Tj
T*(solid \(rather than hollow\), 3‚Äì7¬†cm \(1.2‚Äì2.8¬†in\) long, and 1‚Äì2¬†cm \(0.4‚Äì0.8¬†in\) )Tj
T*(thick near the top. Its shape is variable: either roughly equal in width )Tj
T*(throughout, thicker at the base, or somewhat thicker in the middle. Its surface )Tj
T*(is dry and smooth, and covered with irregularly shaped glandular dots. The )Tj
T*(dots‚Äîminute clumps of pigmented cells‚Äîare initially reddish before becoming )Tj
T*(brownish. The background color of the stem is initially whitish \(roughly the )Tj
T*(same color as the tubes\), but becomes more yellow with age. It does not change )Tj
T*(color when bruised, and does not have a ring. The flesh of the stem is white, )Tj
T*(and does not change color when exposed to air.[1] )Tj
T*( The spore print is olive-brown to pale cinnamon-brown.[5] Individual spores )Tj
T*(are thin-walled, hyaline \(translucent\), and smooth. Their shape is ellipsoid to )Tj
T*(roughly cylindrical in face view, inequilateral when viewed in profile, and )Tj
T*(they measure 9.5‚Äì10 by 2.8‚Äì3.5¬†Œºm. The basidia \(spore-bearing cells of the )Tj
T*(hymenium\) are hyaline, club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 33‚Äì36 )Tj
T*(by 8‚Äì10¬†Œºm. The thin-walled cystidia are rare to scattered on the tube surface )Tj
T*(but abundant on the pores, where they usually occur in massive clusters. They )Tj
T*(appear dark brown when mounted in a dilute \(3%\) solution of potassium hydroxide )Tj
T*(\(KOH\), and are cylindric to roughly club-shaped, measuring 43‚Äì79 by 7‚Äì10¬†Œºm. )Tj
T*(They are usually encrusted with pigment, although some may be hyaline. The )Tj
T*(tissue comprising the tube is hyaline, and made of divergent to nearly parallel )Tj
T*(hyphae that are 3‚Äì5¬†Œºm wide. The pileipellis is a tissue type known as an )Tj
T*(ixotrichodermium \(made of interwoven gelatinized hyphae\); it stains brown in )Tj
T*(KOH, and is made of hyphae that are 4‚Äì5¬†Œºm wide. The stem cuticle is made of )Tj
T*(clusters of cystidia similar to those found in the hymenium. Clamp connections )Tj
T*(are absent in the hyphae of S.¬†pungens.[1] )Tj
T*( Several chemical tests can be employed in the field to aid in the )Tj
T*(identification of S.¬†pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh )Tj
T*(will turn vinaceous \(the color of red wine\), the tubes red, the cap cuticle )Tj
T*(black, and the stem cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide \(NH4OH\), )Tj
T*(the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron\(II\) )Tj
T*(sulfate \(FeSO4\) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the )Tj
T*(stem cuticle light gray.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Edibility )Tj
T*( The mushroom is considered edible, but not choice. Its taste is harsh, )Tj
T*(nauseating, and weakly acidic;[1] the odor is strong and ranges from pleasant, )Tj
T*(resembling bananas, to pungent.[5] When collecting for the table, young )Tj
T*(specimens are preferred, as older ones "literally seethe with fat, agitated )Tj

T*( [edit] Ecology, habitat and distribution )Tj
T*( Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal \(EM\) basidiomycete that forms symbiotic )Tj
T*(relationships almost exclusively with Monterey pine \(Pinus radiata\) and bishop )Tj
T*(pine \(Pinus muricata\); some collections have been made under knobcone pine )Tj
T*(\(Pinus attenuata\)[1] and ponderosa pine \(Pinus ponderosa\), but only within the )Tj
T*(range of Monterey pine.[5] All these trees have small scattered natural ranges )Tj
T*(largely restricted to California.[11] An EM symbiosis is a mutualistic )Tj
T*(relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant. )Tj
T*(The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in )Tj
T*(humus. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus )Tj
T*(vinicolor[7] and Helvella lacunosa.[5]Suillus pungens is often the most )Tj
T*(abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area. The type collection was made on )Tj
T*(the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs )Tj
T*(in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most )Tj
T*(frequently in the autumn and winter,[5] is one of the few species of Suillus )Tj

T*(then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies.[14] In a 1996 )Tj
T*(study, mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that S.¬†)Tj
T*(pungens, an abundant fruiter in pine forests, would be dominant on the roots of )Tj
T*(the pine trees. However, by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to )Tj
T*(above-ground fruit bodies, they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically )Tj
T*(while occupying only a small fraction of the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage, )Tj
T*(which was otherwise dominated by Russula species and Tomentella )Tj
T*(sublilacina.[15][16] Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between )Tj
T*(above- and below-ground representation may be because the fungus invests less )Tj
T*(energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting, or )Tj
T*(alternatively, because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring )Tj
T*(carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain )Tj
T*(enough to allow abundant fruiting.[15] A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and )Tj
T*(colleagues used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect )Tj
T*(minute genetic differences among S.¬†pungens genets, and showed that most of the )Tj
T*(fruiting occurred from a single large genet. This result indicates that the )Tj
T*(fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth, rather than frequent )Tj
T*(establishment of new genets from spores, and that it uses carbon resources )Tj
T*(efficiently.[17] The study also described a S.¬†pungens genet with an area of )Tj
T*(approximately 300¬†m2 \(3,200¬†sq¬†ft\) and a span greater than 40¬†m \(130¬†ft\) )Tj
T*(across, which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported.[17] The )Tj
T*(large S.¬†pungens genet was not detected after wildfire, demonstrating that it )Tj
T*(did not survive in the absence of a host, and suggesting that spores are the )Tj
T*(primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire.[16] )Tj

T*( The Augustinian theodicy is a type of Christian theodicy designed to respond )Tj
T*(to the evidential problem of evil. As such, it attempts to explain the )Tj
T*(probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent \(or all-powerful and perfectly )Tj
T*(loving\) God amid evidence of evil in the world. A number of variations of this )Tj
T*(theodicy have been proposed throughout history, but they typically assert that )Tj
T*(God is perfectly good, that he created the world out of nothing, and that evil )Tj
T*(is the result of the original sin of humans. The entry of evil into the world )Tj
T*(is generally explained as punishment for sin, its continued occurrence owing to )Tj
T*(the evil use of free will by humans. The Augustinian theodicy maintains that )Tj
T*(God is perfectly good and not responsible for evil or suffering. )Tj
T*( Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop the theodicy. He rejected the idea )Tj
T*(that evil exists in itself, instead regarding it as a corruption of goodness, )Tj
T*(caused by humanity's abuse of free will. Augustine believed in the existence of )Tj
T*(a physical Hell as a punishment for sin, but argued that those who choose to )Tj
T*(accept the salvation of Jesus Christ will go to Heaven. Thomas Aquinas, )Tj
T*(influenced by Augustine, proposed a similar theodicy based on the view that God )Tj
T*(is goodness and that there can be no evil in him. He believed that the )Tj
T*(existence of goodness allows evil to exist, through the fault of humans. )Tj
T*(Augustine also influenced John Calvin, who supported Augustine's view that evil )Tj
T*(is the result of free will and argued that sin corrupts humans, requiring God's )Tj
T*(grace to give moral guidance. )Tj
T*( The theodicy was criticised by Augustine's contemporary, Fortunatus, a )Tj
T*(Manichaean who contended that God must still be implicated in evil, and )Tj
T*(eighteenth-century theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's )Tj
T*(concept of evil for not dealing with human suffering. Twentieth-century )Tj
T*(philosopher John Hick presented an alternative theodicy which regards evil as )Tj
T*(necessary for the development of human beings; process theologians have argued )Tj
T*(that God is not omnipotent and so cannot be responsible for evil. Alvin )Tj
T*(Plantinga presented a free will defence in the 1980s, but this was only )Tj
T*(intended to show that God's existence is still logically possible in the face )Tj
T*(of evil, rather than to establish that his existence is probable. Some )Tj
T*(criticisms have also been derived from science, as aspects of the Augustinian )Tj

T*(theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified because of its )Tj
T*(benefits for human development.[1] )Tj
T*( The Augustinian theodicy is a response to the evidential problem of evil,[2] )Tj
T*(which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there )Tj
T*(should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's )Tj
T*(nature or his existence¬†‚Äì he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does )Tj
T*(not exist.[3] Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of )Tj
T*(God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its )Tj
T*(occurrence.[2] The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex )Tj
T*(nihilo \(out of nothing\), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not )Tj
T*(responsible for its occurrence.[4] Evil is not attributed existence in its own )Tj
T*(right, but is described as the privation of good¬†‚Äì the corruption of God's good )Tj
T*(creation.[5] )Tj
T*( The Augustinian theodicy supports the notion of original sin. All versions of )Tj
T*(the theodicy accept a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative, )Tj
T*(including the belief that God created man and woman without sin or suffering. )Tj
T*(Evil is believed to be a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve )Tj
T*(first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden.[6] The free will )Tj
T*(of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for )Tj
T*(moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil.[7] The evil )Tj
T*(nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians )Tj
T*(argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings,[8] )Tj
T*(maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for )Tj
T*(evil.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Development )Tj
T*( [edit] Augustine )Tj
T*( Augustine of Hippo was a Numidian philosopher and theologian who lived from )Tj
T*(354 to 430 AD. He followed the Manichaen religion during his early life, but )Tj
T*(converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, Confessions and City of )Tj
T*(God, develop key ideas regarding his response to suffering. In Confessions, )Tj
T*(Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by materialism and that )Tj
T*(reading Plato's works enabled him to consider the existence of a non-physical )Tj
T*(substance. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a )Tj
T*(theological \(and non-Manichean\) perspective,[10] based on his interpretation of )Tj
T*(the first few chapters of Genesis and the writings of Paul the Apostle.[11] In )Tj
T*(City of God, Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace )Tj
T*(human history and describe its conclusion.[12] )Tj
T*( Augustine proposed that evil could not exist within God, nor be created by )Tj
T*(God, and is instead a by-product of God's creativity.[13] He rejected the )Tj
T*(notion that evil exists in itself, proposing instead that it is a privation of )Tj
T*(\(or falling away from\) good, and a corruption of nature.[14] He wrote that )Tj
T*("evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name )Tj
T*('evil.'"[15] Both moral and natural evil occurs, Augustine argued, owing to an )Tj
T*(evil use of free will,[4] which could be traced back to Adam and Eve's original )Tj
T*(sin.[7] He believed that this evil will, present in the human soul, was a )Tj
T*(corruption of the will given to humans by God, making suffering a just )Tj
T*(punishment for the sin of humans.[16] Because Augustine believed that all of )Tj
T*(humanity was "seminally present in the loins of Adam", he argued that all of )Tj
T*(humanity inherited Adam's sin and his just punishment.[17] However, in spite of )Tj
T*(his belief that free will can be turned to evil, Augustine maintained that it )Tj
T*(is vital for humans to have free will, because they could not live well without )Tj
T*(it. He argued that evil could come from humans because, although humans contain )Tj
T*(no evil, they are also not perfectly good and hence can be corrupted.[18] )Tj
T*( Augustine believed that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment )Tj
T*(is secondary to the punishment being separated from God. He proposed two )Tj
T*(reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to )Tj
T*(follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell.[19] Secondly, he believed )Tj
T*(that Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are )Tj
T*(left unable to resist sin.[20] Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus )Tj
T*(Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only )Tj

T*(be saved if they choose to receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the )Tj
T*(character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved )Tj
T*(continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will )Tj
T*(still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to )Tj
T*(Heaven.[20] )Tj
T*( [edit] Thomas Aquinas )Tj
T*( Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century scholastic philosopher and theologian )Tj
T*(heavily influenced by Augustine,[21] proposed a form of the Augustinian )Tj
T*(theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the )Tj
T*(existence of God,[22] through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good )Tj
T*(and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist.[23] )Tj
T*(Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, )Tj
T*(and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God )Tj
T*(is goodness, and that there is no evil in God.[9] )Tj
T*( Aquinas supported Augustine's view that evil is a privation of goodness, )Tj
T*(maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in )Tj
T*(good.[24] The existence of this evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely )Tj
T*(explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have been )Tj
T*(better off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is )Tj
T*(necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their )Tj
T*(sin.[7] Good is the cause of evil, but only owing the fault on the part of the )Tj
T*(agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks )Tj
T*(goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's )Tj
T*(creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil )Tj
T*(possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God \(who is good\) is )Tj
T*(not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, )Tj
T*(and God is seen to be without defect.[25] Philosopher Eleonore Stump, )Tj
T*(considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a )Tj
T*(positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and )Tj
T*(remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil.[22] Aquinas )Tj
T*(believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and )Tj
T*(that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to )Tj
T*(occur.[26] Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of )Tj
T*(evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than )Tj
T*(willing it.[27] He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did )Tj
T*(not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to )Tj
T*(spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility )Tj
T*(for evil owing to their abuse of free will.[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] John Calvin )Tj
T*( John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and principal figure in the )Tj
T*(development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works.[29] Unlike )Tj
T*(Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and )Tj
T*(suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it.[30] )Tj
T*(Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin is the result of the fall of )Tj
T*(man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. )Tj
T*(He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with )Tj
T*(ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful )Tj
T*(nature.[31] Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the )Tj
T*(elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are )Tj
T*(the only ones who will be saved.[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception )Tj
T*( [edit] Fortunatus )Tj
T*( Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, which )Tj
T*(partly touches on the problem of evil, records a public debate between )Tj
T*(Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised )Tj
T*(Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, )Tj
T*(then he must be implicated in human sin \(a problem that Augustine had himself )Tj
T*(considered four years earlier, in Free Will\). Quoting the New Testament, )Tj
T*(Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and )Tj
T*(that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature.[33] Augustine )Tj

T*(replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way )Tj
T*(similar to the formation of habits.[34] This was not a teaching on original sin )Tj
T*(\(a view that Augustine was yet to formulate\), but on the limitations of human )Tj
T*(freedom caused by sin.[35] Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the )Tj
T*(scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that )Tj
T*(Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not )Tj
T*(defend his views on the origin of evil.[36] )Tj
T*( [edit] Buddhism )Tj
T*( Scholars of religion Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng argued that the )Tj
T*(teachings of Buddhism challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a )Tj
T*(dualism in which good and evil have equal value instead of casting good over )Tj
T*(evil, as Augustine did. This is similar to the Manicheist account of good and )Tj
T*(evil¬†‚Äì that the two are equal and in conflict¬†‚Äì though Buddhism teaches that )Tj
T*(the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict.[37] Ingram )Tj
T*(and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the )Tj
T*(existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents in the form of the )Tj
T*(serpent's temptation.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Francesco Antonio Zaccaria )Tj
T*( The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's )Tj
T*(concept of evil in the eighteenth-century. He noted a distinction between using )Tj
T*(the term evil to imply blame \(sin\) and to imply lament \(suffering\) and argued )Tj
T*(that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was )Tj
T*(problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and )Tj
T*(disinterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil )Tj
T*(as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as )Tj
T*(to why suffering exists.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] John Hick )Tj
T*( John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he developed his own )Tj
T*(theodicy in 1966. Hick supported the views of Germany theologian Friedrich )Tj
T*(Schleiermacher, which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is )Tj
T*(perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies )Tj
T*(the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy )Tj
T*(attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the Irenaean theodicy )Tj
T*(seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world )Tj
T*(went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were )Tj
T*(made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made )Tj
T*(an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge )Tj
T*(that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a )Tj
T*(theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his )Tj
T*(creation would make, he must be responsible for them.[39] Hick's theodicy )Tj
T*(rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an )Tj
T*(eternal hell would render "a Christian theodicy impossible".[40] The Irenaean )Tj
T*(theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God )Tj
T*(from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but )Tj
T*(justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both )Tj
T*(theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world )Tj
T*(is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good )Tj
T*(out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.[41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Process theology )Tj
T*( In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, published in 1976, David Ray )Tj
T*(Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will and argued that it is )Tj
T*(incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later )Tj
T*(works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented )Tj
T*(that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will )Tj
T*(do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could )Tj
T*(not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as )Tj
T*(Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment )Tj
T*(he wills unjust.[42] )Tj

T*(prominent process theologian, argues that God feels the pain of the world \(both )Tj
T*(physically and emotionally\) and does everything within his power to achieve )Tj
T*(good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he )Tj
T*(does not play a coercive role in the world.[43] Process theology teaches that, )Tj
T*(rather than creating the world ex nihilo \(as Augustine proposed\), God created )Tj
T*(it out of a pre-existent chaos.[44] )Tj
T*( [edit] Alvin Plantinga )Tj
T*( In the 1980s, Alvin Plantinga presented a version of the free will defence )Tj
T*(which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent )Tj
T*(God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be )Tj
T*(shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily )Tj
T*(contradictory.[45] To do this, Plantinga believed that a "possible state of )Tj
T*(affairs" must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the )Tj
T*(existence of evil consistent.[46] He argued that a third proposition¬†‚Äì that )Tj
T*(evil is the result of the actions of free, rational, fallible human beings¬†‚Äì )Tj
T*(allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent.[47] Plantinga supported )Tj
T*(this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God )Tj
T*(could not do, yet remain omnipotent¬†‚Äì for example, if an omnipotent God has )Tj
T*(necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. )Tj
T*(For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any )Tj
T*(universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a )Tj
T*(world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God )Tj
T*(could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable.[a] )Tj
T*(Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad )Tj
T*(moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where )Tj
T*(there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of )Tj
T*(an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not )Tj
T*(inconsistent.[49] )Tj
T*( Plantinga's version of the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but )Tj
T*(not his natural theology.[50] Rather than attempt to show the existence of God )Tj
T*(as likely in the face of evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will )Tj
T*(defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, )Tj
T*(despite the existence of evil.[51] Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, )Tj
T*(because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are )Tj
T*(logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did )Tj
T*(not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that )Tj
T*(it is logically possible.[47] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critique from a scientific position )Tj
T*( John Hick criticised Augustine's theory for being "implausible" in light of )Tj
T*(Darwin's theory of evolution, as it would make Augustine's idea of a fall from )Tj
T*(perfection inaccurate;[52] this is reiterated by Professors Nancey Murphy and )Tj
T*(George Francis Rayner Ellis, who also contend that Augustine's idea of )Tj
T*(transmitting original sin from Adam to the rest of humanity requires biological )Tj
T*(explanation.[53] Professor of Comparative Religion Arvind Sharma has argued )Tj
T*(that natural evil cannot be the result of moral evil in the way Augustine )Tj
T*(suggested: scientific consensus is that natural disasters and disease existed )Tj
T*(before humans and hence cannot be the result of human sin.[54] )Tj
T*( The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr attempted to reinterpret )Tj
T*(the Augustinian theodicy in the light of evolutionary science by presenting its )Tj
T*(underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected )Tj
T*(the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin )Tj
T*(to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, )Tj
T*(by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically )Tj
T*(inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome )Tj
T*(sin on its own.[55] Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the )Tj
T*(human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the )Tj
T*(logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, )Tj
T*(which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal )Tj
T*(interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific )Tj
T*(positions.[56] )Tj

T*( Lemurs of Madagascar, currently in its third edition, is a reference work and )Tj
T*(field guide for the lemurs of Madagascar, giving descriptions and biogeographic )Tj
T*(data for the known species. The primary contributor is Russell Mittermeier, )Tj
T*(president of Conservation International, and the cover art and illustrations )Tj
T*(were drawn by Stephen D. Nash. The book provides details about all known lemur )Tj
T*(species, general information about lemurs and their history, and also helps )Tj
T*(travelers identify species they may encounter. Four related pocket field guides )Tj
T*(have also been released, containing color illustrations of each species, )Tj
T*(miniature range maps, and species checklists. )Tj
T*( The first edition was reviewed favorably in the International Journal of )Tj
T*(Primatology, Conservation Biology, and Lemur News. Reviewers, including Alison )Tj
T*(Jolly, praised the book for its meticulous coverage of each species, numerous )Tj
T*(high-quality illustrations, and engaging discussion of lemur topics, including )Tj
T*(conservation, evolution, and the recently extinct subfossil lemurs. Each agreed )Tj
T*(that the book was an excellent resource for a wide audience, including )Tj
T*(ecotourists and lemur researchers. A lengthy review of the second edition was )Tj
T*(published in the American Journal of Primatology, where it received similar )Tj
T*(favorable comments, plus praise for its updates and enhancements. The third )Tj

T*( The first edition identified 50¬†lemur species and subspecies, compared to 71 )Tj

T*(cover artist. The main author for all three editions is Russell A. Mittermeier, )Tj
T*(president of CI and a well-published primatologist, herpetologist and )Tj
T*(biological anthropologist.[4] In the first edition, four other authors were )Tj
T*(also listed: Ian Tattersall, a curator in the Division of Anthropology at the )Tj
T*(American Museum of Natural History; William R. Konstant, the Director of )Tj
T*(Conservation and Science at the Houston Zoo; David M. Meyers, a researcher and )Tj

T*(guides, along with thumbnail range maps for each species. The four pocket )Tj
T*(guides include two editions of Lemurs of Madagascar Pocket Identification Guide )Tj
T*(\(out of print\), Nocturnal Lemurs, and Diurnal and Cathemeral Lemurs.[9] The )Tj
T*(Nocturnal Lemurs booklet contains 65¬†species from eight genera.[10]Diurnal and )Tj

T*(third edition of the field guide.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Content )Tj
T*( All three editions are split into multiple chapters, sections, and )Tj
T*(appendices.[1][3] In the second and third editions, the inside of the front and )Tj
T*(back covers include a quick visual reference, with color-coded illustrations )Tj
T*(for each lemur type and colored tabs to help locate their corresponding )Tj
T*(sections. A section entitled "How to Use this Field Guide" is included between )Tj
T*(the "Introduction" and the first chapter. In this section, the layout of the )Tj
T*(book is discussed in detail, including the quick visual reference, chapters, )Tj
T*(appendices, references, and lemur-watching checklist. The chapter "The Living )Tj
T*(Lemurs" is discussed in great detail, including each section heading used for )Tj
T*(all the lemur species.[14][15] )Tj
T*( The "Introduction" in the first two editions was written by Peter A. )Tj
T*(Seligmann, Chairman of the Board and CEO of CI, and Mittermeier.[16][17] In the )Tj
T*(third edition, the "Introduction" was written only by Mittermeier.[18] In it, )Tj
T*(they emphasize the richness of Madagascar's primate diversity, summarize the )Tj
T*(conservation efforts and opportunities for preserving that diversity, and )Tj
T*(highlight recent discoveries, while also acknowledging the need for additional )Tj
T*(research.[16][17] The chapter entitled "Origins of Lemurs" \("Origin of the )Tj
T*(Lemurs" in the third edition\) briefly summarizes the theories on how lemurs )Tj
T*(came to Madagascar and the difficulty in resolving the mystery.[19][20][21] )Tj
T*("Discovery and Study of the Living Lemurs" reviews the history of exploration, )Tj
T*(field research, and taxonomic nomenclature of lemurs,[22][23][24] starting from )Tj
T*(the 1625 description of a Ring-tailed Lemur to contemporary research by Western )Tj
T*(and Malagasy scientists.[1] "The Extinct Lemurs" discusses the recently extinct )Tj
T*(subfossil lemurs, including the monkey lemurs, sloth lemurs, and koala )Tj
T*(lemurs.[25][26][27] "Conservation of Lemurs" details the threats lemurs face, )Tj
T*(such as habitat destruction and hunting for bushmeat, and conservation efforts )Tj
T*(aimed at their protection, from the in-situ and ex-situ programs of the )Tj
T*(Madagascar Fauna Group to the promise by Madagascar's former president Marc )Tj
T*(Ravalomanana to triple the country's protected areas over five years, known as )Tj
T*(the Durban Vision.[28][29][30] In the third edition, a new chapter was added, )Tj
T*(entitled "Madagascar's Ancient Geological History", written by Maarten de Wit )Tj
T*(from the University of Cape Town. In it, three billion years of geological and )Tj
T*(biological history are explored in detail.[31] )Tj
T*( The majority of the book, including the chapter "The Living Lemurs" and )Tj
T*(separate sections on each taxonomic group of lemur, providing detailed accounts )Tj
T*(of all lemur species known up until the time of publication, from the tiny )Tj
T*(mouse lemurs to the large indri and diademed sifaka. In the first and second )Tj
T*(editions, the chapter "The Living Lemurs" is broken first into sections on )Tj
T*(families, and then into species clumped together by genus.[32][33] In the third )Tj
T*(edition, each family is assigned its own chapter number, separate from "The )Tj
T*(Living Lemurs" chapter, yet the order and layout are the same.[34] In the )Tj
T*(second and third editions, all pages within each family section are assigned a )Tj
T*(colored tab to match those in the quick visual reference inside the )Tj
T*(covers.[33][15] Each species subsection has a distribution map, an illustration )Tj
T*(or photo \(if available\), a list of common names in multiple languages )Tj
T*(\(including Malagasy\), and species information broken into five sections: )Tj
T*("Identification", "Geographic Range", "Natural History", "Conservation Status", )Tj

T*(topography, rivers, forest cover, regions, and lemur watching sites.[40][41] )Tj
T*(Appendix B, entitled "Biogeographic Regions and Floristic Domains of )Tj
T*(Madagascar" discusses the regions and domains of Madagascar.[42][43] Appendix )Tj
T*(C, "Key Sites for Watching Lemurs", covers characteristics and highlights of )Tj
T*(individual national parks, reserves, and regions for lemur watching.[44][45] )Tj
T*(The third edition added Appendix D, entitled "Primate-watching and Primate )Tj
T*(Life-listing". In it, primate-watching and primate life-listing \(the act of )Tj

T*( [edit] Reviews )Tj
T*( In a 1996 review of the first edition in the International Journal of )Tj
T*(Primatology, Lisa Gould spoke favorably of the book, citing passages about )Tj
T*(lemur descriptions from the 17th and 18th centuries that she found entertaining )Tj
T*(and informative. She was particularly fascinated with Chapter four, "The )Tj
T*(Extinct Lemurs", and the reconstructions by Nash that accompanied the )Tj

T*(being one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book. The book was hailed as an )Tj
T*(excellent source for identifying lemur species for both tourists and )Tj
T*(researchers.[1] The book was also briefly reviewed in College &amp; Research )Tj
T*(Libraries News by George Eberhart in April 1996. The review noted Conservation )Tj
T*(International's promotion of ecotourism while also providing a count of the )Tj
T*(book's illustrations: 35 color plates, 50 distribution maps, and 135 drawings )Tj
T*(of postures and behaviors.[51] )Tj
T*( In the 1996 edition \(volume 2\) of Lemur News, Alison Jolly praised the first )Tj
T*(edition for its "contribution to knowledge in general" and "its effect on its )Tj
T*(intended audience." Like Gould, Jolly praised the work as a field guide, as )Tj
T*(well as Nash's high-quality illustrations. She noted the attraction of Nash's )Tj
T*(subfossil lemur reconstruction, claiming that it was "rapidly becoming one of )Tj
T*(the most pirated single book illustration on the primate lecture-slide )Tj
T*(circuit." Jolly went on to praise the thoroughness of the natural history )Tj
T*(information provided for each species, including recently described species, )Tj
T*(noting that the information covered existing knowledge better than any other )Tj
T*(published literature, even when only a single paragraph was provided for poorly )Tj
T*(known species. The book was recommended not only for lemur specialists, but )Tj
T*(also for tourists, hoping it would spark an interest in ecotourism in )Tj
T*(impoverished Madagascar. The checklist of species, as well as the information )Tj
T*(on where to most easily spot them, earned a special mention from Jolly, who )Tj
T*(could only boast seeing 30 of the 50 known species at that time. Finally, the )Tj
T*("most significant and most appreciative" audience Jolly mentioned was the )Tj
T*(Malagasy researchers, to whom Mittermeier reportedly gave 50 copies of the book )Tj
T*(during a workshop in 1995.[7] )Tj
T*( In a 1997 review from Conservation Biology by Joelisoa Ratsirarson, the book )Tj
T*(was referred to as a "remarkable achievement" for its up-to-date information, )Tj
T*(and for being the first comprehensive lemur field guide. Emphasizing many of )Tj
T*(the same highlights as Gould and Jolly, he went on to note the inclusion of )Tj
T*(captive management information, unpublished details, and the use of common )Tj
T*(names in English, French, German, and Malagasy. His critique focused on the )Tj
T*(organization of the illustrations in relation to the text, the lack of an )Tj
T*(index, and a desire for more information about the roles lemurs play in their )Tj
T*(ecosystem. Though he praised it for being useful to tourists, researchers, )Tj
T*(students, resource managers, and conservationists, he expressed concern over )Tj
T*(its lack of availability in the bookstores of Madagascar.[52] )Tj
T*( The completely revised second edition of Lemurs of Madagascar was reviewed in )Tj
T*(detail in the American Journal of Primatology by Stacey Tecot. Each chapter, )Tj
T*(section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of )Tj
T*(previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted as one of the more )Tj
T*("fascinating" parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and )Tj
T*(informative illustrations. Although the book received only praise, Tecot did )Tj
T*(suggest two additions for the next edition: the need for information about the )Tj
T*(processes of island biogeography and expansion on captive conservation programs )Tj
T*(aside from the Duke Lemur Center, particularly at the Lemur Conservation )Tj
T*(Foundation and St. Catherines Island. A subject index was also recommended, )Tj
T*(along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations. Otherwise, the )Tj
T*(book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion )Tj
T*(of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as how to get to lemur )Tj
T*(watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, )Tj
T*(listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other )Tj
T*(things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area. Tecot noted that )Tj
T*(the lemur checklist promoted competitive lemur watching, similar to )Tj
T*(birdwatching, and that the color-coded sections assisted in "on-the-fly species )Tj
T*(identification." Although very satisfied with the information provided for each )Tj
T*(species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively )Tj
T*(cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition. Like its )Tj
T*(predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for )Tj
T*(ecotourists and researchers. It was also noted for its attempt to promote )Tj
T*(ecotourism as a conservation strategy.[3] )Tj

T*( This newer edition was also mentioned briefly in the 2006 edition \(volume 11\) )Tj
T*(of Lemur News. The publication announcement highlighted the extensive coverage )Tj
T*(of scientific information throughout a range of chapters and appendices. The )Tj
T*(edition is said to contain over 200 illustrations, including drawings, photos, )Tj
T*(and maps.[53] )Tj
T*( The 2010 third edition was reviewed in Lemur News by Alex Dunkel. He praised )Tj
T*(the increased level of detail in the new edition, which adds additional )Tj
T*(information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of )Tj
T*(lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel )Tj
T*(wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these )Tj
T*(challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that )Tj
T*(the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.[54] )Tj
T*( [edit] Impact on lemur taxonomy )Tj
T*( While the first edition recognized 50¬†lemur taxa \(32¬†species and 25¬†)Tj
T*(subspecies\), the second edition recognized 71 lemur taxa \(68¬†species and 5¬†)Tj
T*(subspecies\) just 12¬†years later.[57] The second edition followed the )Tj
T*(recommendations of Colin Groves in the third edition of Mammal Species of the )Tj
T*(World from 2005 by recognizing newly identified nocturnal species and raising )Tj
T*(many former subspecies to species status.[58] For comparison, Tattersall's book )Tj
T*(Primates of Madagascar from 1982 listed only 20¬†species and 29¬†subspecies.[59] )Tj
T*(Following the publication of the second edition, Nick Garbutt recognized 87¬†)Tj
T*(species and 5¬†subspecies in his book Mammals of Madagascar.[60] )Tj
T*( Not all lemur researchers agree with the species promotions supported by these )Tj
T*(books. Researchers such as Tattersall and Anne D. Yoder, director of the Duke )Tj
T*(Lemur Center, have raised concerns about taxonomic inflation.[58][61] In )Tj
T*(particular, Tattersall has noted a steep decline in polytypic lemur species, or )Tj
T*(species with defined subspecies, starting with the first edition of Lemurs of )Tj
T*(Madagascar and becoming more pronounced in the second edition. He noted that )Tj
T*(more than half of the new species added in the second edition were promoted )Tj
T*(subspecies and questioned whether Madagascar could produce so many monotypic )Tj
T*(species.[58] )Tj
T*( Prior to the release of the third edition of Lemurs of Madagascar, many of the )Tj
T*(major contributors, as well as Colin Groves, teamed up in 2008 to compile an )Tj
T*(updated lemur species list, published under the title "Lemur diversity in )Tj
T*(Madagascar" in the International Journal of Primatology. In it, 99¬†lemur taxa )Tj
T*(were recognized \(97¬†species and 3¬†subspecies\).[62] The third edition went on to )Tj
T*(recognize 101¬†lemur taxa \(97¬†species and 6¬†subspecies\) and suggested that )Tj
T*(future research could reveal as many as 110 to 125 taxa.[18]  )Tj

T*( "Speechless" is a song by the American recording artist Michael Jackson, )Tj
T*(included on his tenth studio album, Invincible \(2001\). The single was only )Tj
T*(released in Korea. The singer was inspired to write the ballad after a water )Tj
T*(balloon fight with children in Germany. Jackson collaborated on the production )Tj
T*(with musicians such as Jeremy Lubbock, Brad Buxer, Novi Novoq, Stuart Bradley )Tj
T*(and Bruce Swedien. Andra√© Crouch and his gospel choir provided backing vocals. )Tj
T*( Executives at Jackson's record label, Epic Records, responded positively to )Tj
T*(the track when given a preview several months before Invincible's release. )Tj
T*("Speechless" was issued as a promotional single, receiving mixed reviews from )Tj
T*(music critics. Commentary focused on the track's a¬†cappellas, lyrics and music. )Tj
T*(A clip of Jackson singing "Speechless" was included in the 2009 )Tj
T*(documentary-concert film Michael Jackson's This Is It. )Tj
T*( [edit] Writing and recording )Tj
T*( Michael Jackson wrote "Speechless" after a water balloon fight with children )Tj
T*(in Germany. It took him 45 minutes.[1] In an interview with Vibe magazine, the )Tj
T*(musician commented, "I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in )Tj
T*(their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. I hate to say that, )Tj
T*(because it's such a romantic song." He added, "But it was the fight that did )Tj
T*(it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. I felt it would be )Tj
T*(good enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and )Tj
T*(creativity."[2][3] )Tj
T*( "Speechless" was one of only two songs from Invincible to be written solely by )Tj
T*(Jackson \(the second song being "The Lost Children"\).[4] Jeremy Lubbock worked )Tj
T*(with the musician in arranging and conducting an orchestra. Instrumentalists on )Tj
T*(the track included Brad Buxer on keyboards, and Novi Novoq and Thomas Tally on )Tj
T*(violas. The violinists consisted of Peter Kent, Gina Kronstadt, Robin Lorentz, )Tj
T*(Kirstin Fife and John Wittenberg. The track featured backing vocals from Andra√© )Tj
T*(Crouch and his gospel choir, The Andra√© Crouch Singers. "Speechless" was )Tj
T*(digitally edited by Buxer and Stuart Brawley, and was mixed by Bruce )Tj
T*(Swedien,[5] who later said, "Everything with Michael is a stand-out moment but )Tj
T*(an absolutely gorgeous piece of music called 'Speechless' was really an event. )Tj
T*(Michael sings the first eight bars a¬†cappella. At the end, he closes it off a¬†)Tj
T*(cappella¬†‚Äì it was Michael's idea to add the a¬†cappella parts."[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Composition )Tj
T*( The lyrics to "Speechless" deal with being lost for words because of love.[7] )Tj
T*(The song opens with Jackson's singing a¬†cappella: "Your love is magical, that's )Tj
T*(how I feel, but I have not the words here to explain", which Rick de Yampert of )Tj
T*(The Daytona Beach News-Journal felt the singer "[crooned] sweetly".[5][8] The )Tj
T*(chorus includes the lines, "Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me )Tj
T*(feel. Though I'm with you, I am far away and nothing is for real."[5] A second )Tj
T*(a¬†cappella verse bookends the track.[9] )Tj
T*( "Speechless" is a ballad,[10][11] and is described as an R&amp;B, pop and soul )Tj
T*(song on the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing. )Tj
T*(It adds that the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80¬†beats )Tj
T*(per minute. The song starts in the key of B‚ô≠ major and transitions to C major. )Tj

T*(The song's vocal range is from F4 to B5.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Post-production and release )Tj
T*( In June 2001, several months before the release of Invincible, "Speechless" )Tj
T*(was among several songs showcased from the album exclusively to executives of )Tj
T*(Jackson's music label, Epic Records \(a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment\). )Tj
T*(Other songs previewed included "Unbreakable", "The Lost Children","Whatever )Tj
T*(Happens", "Break of Dawn","Heaven Can Wait" and "Privacy", all of which )Tj
T*(featured on Invincible's track listing.[13][14] Roger Friedman of Fox News )Tj
T*(reported that the executives who listened to the previews liked what they )Tj
T*(heard. Epic Records' president, Dave Glew, said of the tracks, "It's wonderful )Tj
T*(and amazing. Michael is singing better than ever." He added, "The ballads! The )Tj
T*(ballads are beautiful, and they're all there."[15] "Speechless" was later )Tj
T*(released as a promotional single in 2001. A remixed version of "You Rock My )Tj
T*(World", featuring rapper Jay-Z, served as the single's B-side.[16] After )Tj
T*(Jackson's death several months later, a clip of the entertainer singing )Tj
T*("Speechless" was included in Michael Jackson's This Is It, a commercially )Tj
T*(successful documentary-concert film of the singer's rehearsals for his London )Tj
T*(concert series.[17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical reception )Tj
T*( "Speechless" received a mixed reaction from music journalists. Craig Seymour )Tj
T*(of The Buffalo News felt that the song was the only one from the album in which )Tj
T*(Jackson successfully revisited his past. The journalist said the song was )Tj
T*(reminiscent of the 1995 chart-topper "You Are Not Alone", as it sounded to him )Tj
T*(like a track that could have been written by R. Kelly, who penned the number )Tj
T*(one hit.[18] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis described )Tj
T*("Speechless" as a "beautifully minimal, heartfelt romantic ballad".[19] Music )Tj
T*(journalist Roger Catlin stated that the song leaned toward "neo-gospel".[9] The )Tj
T*(New York Post said that "Speechless" was "lullaby-like" and the best song on )Tj
T*(Invincible, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Jackson's "long lines )Tj
T*(and creamy overdubbed choruses [sailing] weightlessly" in the ballad, that the )Tj
T*(journalist felt could have been "a love song to God".[20][21] )Tj
T*( Pop music critic Robert Hilburn described "Speechless", and another song from )Tj
T*(Invincible \("Butterflies"\), as being "as woefully generic as their titles".[7] )Tj
T*(Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the a¬†cappellas in "Speechless" )Tj
T*(were enough to make a person wish that Jackson actually was unable to make a )Tj
T*(sound.[22]Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a )Tj
T*("shining [example] of what happens when The Gloved One gets beside himself and )Tj
T*(writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a CD changer somewhere in a )Tj
T*(preschool".[23] The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that "Speechless" was one of )Tj
T*(the weaker tracks from Invincible.[24] Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt )Tj

T*( Sicilian Baroque is the distinctive form of Baroque architecture that took )Tj
T*(hold on the island of Sicily, off the southern coast of Italy, in the 17th and )Tj
T*(18th centuries. The style is recognizable not only by its typical Baroque )Tj
T*(curves and flourishes, but also by its grinning masks and putti and a )Tj
T*(particular flamboyance that has given Sicily a unique architectural identity. )Tj
T*( The Sicilian Baroque style came to fruition during a major surge of rebuilding )Tj
T*(following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style had )Tj
T*(been used on the island in a na√Øve and parochial manner, having evolved from )Tj
T*(hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque )Tj
T*(architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them )Tj
T*(trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more )Tj
T*(sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; )Tj
T*(the work of these local architects ‚Äî and the new genre of architectural )Tj
T*(engravings that they pioneered ‚Äî inspired more local architects to follow their )Tj
T*(lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence in their use )Tj
T*(of the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution )Tj
T*(to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s )Tj
T*(onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly-fashionable )Tj
T*(neoclassicism. )Tj
T*( The highly decorative Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, and )Tj
T*(perfectly reflected the social order of the island at a time when, nominally )Tj
T*(ruled by Spain, it was in fact governed by a wealthy and often extravagant )Tj
T*(aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy )Tj
T*(was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an )Tj
T*(architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century. )Tj
T*( [edit] Characteristics )Tj
T*( Baroque architecture is a European phenomenon originating in 17th-century )Tj
T*(Italy; it is flamboyant and theatrical, and richly ornamented by sculpture and )Tj
T*(an effect known as chiaroscuro, the strategic use of light and shade on a )Tj
T*(building created by mass and shadow. )Tj
T*( The Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the )Tj
T*(church, and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian )Tj
T*(aristocracy.[1] The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked )Tj
T*(individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by )Tj
T*(Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, even at this early )Tj
T*(stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular )Tj
T*(features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, )Tj
T*(when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the )Tj
T*(mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following )Tj
T*(features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to )Tj
T*(characterise in words. )Tj
T*( 1: Grotesque masks and putti, often supporting balconies or decorating various )Tj
T*(bands of the entablature of a building; these grinning or glaring faces are a )Tj

T*(2 and 9\). )Tj
T*( 2: Balconies, often complemented by intricate wrought iron balustrades after )Tj
T*(1633 \(Illustrations 2 &amp; 9\), and by plainer balustrades before that date )Tj
T*(\(Illustration 6\). )Tj
T*( 3: External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were designed for formal )Tj
T*(entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street fa√ßade, leading to a )Tj
T*(courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard )Tj
T*(to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the )Tj
T*(first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn )Tj
T*(inwards and outwards as many as four times. Owing to the topography of their )Tj
T*(elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these )Tj
T*(steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in )Tj
T*(themselves decorative architectural features \(illustration 19\), in the manner )Tj
T*(of the Spanish Steps in Rome. )Tj
T*( 4: Canted, concave, or convex fa√ßades \(Illustrations 1 and 6\). Occasionally in )Tj

T*( 5: The Sicilian belfry. Belfrys were not placed beside the church in a )Tj

T*(and decorated arcade at the highest point of the principal fa√ßade \(Illustration )Tj
T*(3\). These belfries are among the most enduring and characteristic features of )Tj
T*(Sicilian Baroque architecture. )Tj
T*( 6: Inlaid coloured marble set into both floor and walls especially in church )Tj

T*( 7: Columns that are often deployed singularly, supporting plain arches and )Tj
T*(thus displaying the influence of the earlier and much plainer Norman period )Tj
T*(\(Illustration 3\). Columns are rarely encountered, as elsewhere in Europe, in )Tj
T*(clustered groups acting as piers, especially in examples of early Sicilian )Tj
T*(Baroque. )Tj
T*( 8: Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had decorated the blocks of ashlar )Tj
T*(in his rustication; by the end of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were )Tj
T*(ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets )Tj
T*(and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental )Tj
T*(symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars )Tj
T*(rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke )Tj
T*(\(illustration 2\). )Tj
T*( 9: The local volcanic lava stone that was used in the construction of many )Tj
T*(Sicilian Baroque buildings, because this was the most readily available. Shades )Tj
T*(of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects, )Tj
T*(accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade as demonstrated in )Tj
T*(\(illustration 2\). )Tj
T*( 10: The Spanish influence. The architectural influence of the ruling Spanish )Tj
T*(\(Illustration 13\), although this was a milder influence than that of the )Tj
T*(Normans. The Spanish style, a more restrained version of French renaissance )Tj
T*(architecture, is particularly evident in eastern Sicily, where ‚Äî owing to minor )Tj
T*(insurrections ‚Äî the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's )Tj
T*(monumental Porta Grazia, erected in 1680 as the entrance to a Spanish citadel, )Tj
T*(would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish )Tj
T*(in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched city gate, with its )Tj
T*(ornate mouldings and scrolls, was widely copied all over Catania immediately )Tj
T*(following the quake. )Tj
T*( While these characteristics never occur all together in the same building, and )Tj
T*(none are unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives )Tj
T*(the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such )Tj

T*(all be found on Baroque building all over Europe. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early Sicilian Baroque )Tj
T*( Volcanic Sicily in the central Mediterranean, off the Italian peninsula, has )Tj
T*(been colonised by the Greeks, then it was under the Romans, the Byzantines, the )Tj
T*(Ostrogoths, the Muslims, the Normans, the Hohenstaufen, the Angevins and the )Tj
T*(Aragonese, after whom it became a province of the Spanish Empire and then was )Tj
T*(part of the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, before finally being absorbed )Tj
T*(into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. Thus Sicilians have been exposed to a rich )Tj
T*(sequence of disparate cultures; this is reflected in the extraordinary )Tj
T*(diversity of architecture on the island. )Tj
T*( A form of decorated classical architecture peculiar to Sicily had begun to )Tj
T*(evolve from the 1530s. Inspired by the ruined Greek architecture and by the )Tj
T*(Norman cathedrals on the island, this often incorporated Greek architectural )Tj
T*(motifs such as the Greek key pattern into late Norman architecture with Gothic )Tj
T*(features such as pointed arches and window apertures. The Sicilian Norman )Tj
T*(architecture incorporated some Byzantine elements seldom found in Norman )Tj
T*(architecture elsewhere, and like other Romanesque architecture it went on to )Tj
T*(incorporate Gothic features. This early ornate architecture differs from that )Tj
T*(of mainland Europe in not having evolved from Renaissance architecture; )Tj
T*(instead, it was developed from Norman styles. Renaissance architecture hardly )Tj
T*(touched Sicily; in the capital city of Palermo, the only remnant of the High )Tj
T*(Renaissance is a water fountain, brought from Florence when it was already 20 )Tj
T*(years old \(Illustration 5\). )Tj
T*( Whatever the reason that Renaissance style never became popular in Sicily, it )Tj
T*(was certainly not ignorance. Antonello Gagini was midway through constructing )Tj
T*(the church of Santa Maria di Porto Salvo in 1536 in the Renaissance style when )Tj
T*(he died; he was superseded by the architect Antonio Scaglione, who completed )Tj
T*(the building in a Norman style. This style seems to have influenced Sicilian )Tj
T*(architecture almost up to the time of the 1693 earthquake. Even Mannerism )Tj
T*(passed the island by. Only in the architecture of Messina[2] could a )Tj
T*(Renaissance influence be discerned, partly for geographical reasons: within )Tj
T*(sight of mainland Italy and the most important port in Sicily, Messina was )Tj
T*(always more amenable to the prevailing tides of fashion outside the island. The )Tj
T*(town's aristocratic patrons would often call on Florence or Rome to provide )Tj
T*(them with an architect; one example was the Florentine Giovanni Angelo )Tj
T*(Montorsoli, who established the Tuscan styles of architecture and sculpture )Tj
T*(there in the mid-16th century. However, these influences remained largely )Tj
T*(confined to Messina and the surrounding district. It seems likely that it was )Tj
T*(the patronage of the Roman Catholic Church, removed from the influences of )Tj
T*(Roman fashion, that remained conservative in architectural taste. )Tj
T*( This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere )Tj
T*(in Europe. Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by )Tj
T*(the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. )Tj
T*(This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with )Tj
T*(ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his )Tj
T*(family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches \(1531‚Äì37\), )Tj
T*(Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the "Capella della )Tj
T*(Madonna" in the "Santuario dell'Annunziata" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to )Tj
T*(the sanctuary has pilasters ‚Äî not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief )Tj
T*(busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the )Tj
T*(pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central )Tj
T*(shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, )Tj
T*(was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative )Tj
T*(architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Ges√π \(Illustration 14\), )Tj
T*(constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian )Tj
T*(Baroque. )Tj
T*( Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily )Tj
T*(long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that )Tj
T*(can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the )Tj

T*(scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century )Tj
T*(architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the )Tj
T*(architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed )Tj
T*(not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more )Tj
T*(information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during )Tj
T*(World War II. )Tj
T*( The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, )Tj
T*(an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of )Tj
T*(the city's two principal streets. Around this intersection are four open sides, )Tj
T*(being the streets, and four matching buildings with identical canted corners. )Tj
T*(The sides of the four buildings are curved, further heightening the Baroque )Tj
T*(design of the buildings lining the circus. These four great buildings )Tj
T*(dominating the circus are each enhanced by a fountain, reminiscent of those of )Tj
T*(Pope Sixtus V's "Quattro Fontane" in Rome. However, here in Palermo the Baroque )Tj
T*(theme continues up three storeys of the buildings, which are adorned with )Tj
T*(statues in recessed niches depicting the four seasons, the four Spanish kings )Tj
T*(of Sicily, and the four patronesses of Palermo: Saints Cristina, Ninfa, Olivia, )Tj
T*(and Agata. )Tj
T*( While each fa√ßade of Quattro Canti is pleasing to the eye, as a scheme it is )Tj
T*(both out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other )Tj
T*(examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and )Tj
T*(heavy-handed, compared with later developments.[3] Whatever its merit, it is )Tj
T*(evident that during the 17th century, the Baroque style in the hands of the )Tj
T*(local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland )Tj
T*(Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to )Tj
T*(Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin )Tj
T*(Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin. )Tj
T*( [edit] Sicilian Baroque from 1693 )Tj
T*( [edit] Earthquake and patrons )Tj
T*( The great Sicilian earthquake of 1693 destroyed at least 45 towns and cities, )Tj
T*(affecting an area of 5600 square kilometres and causing the deaths of about )Tj
T*(60,000 people.[4] The epicentre of the disaster was offshore, although the )Tj
T*(exact position remains unknown. Other towns which suffered severely were )Tj
T*(Ragusa, Modica, Scicli, and Ispica. Rebuilding began almost immediately. )Tj
T*( The lavishness of the architecture that was to arise from this disaster is )Tj
T*(connected with the politics of Sicily at the time; Sicily was still officially )Tj
T*(under Spanish rule, but rule was effectively delegated to the native )Tj
T*(aristocracy. This was led by the Duke of Camastra, whom the Spanish had )Tj
T*(appointed viceroy to appease the aristocracy, who were numerous. The )Tj
T*(aristocracy was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe, and a )Tj
T*(gentry class was missing. In the 18th century, one estimate held that there )Tj
T*(were 228 noble families, who provided Sicily with a ruling class consisting of )Tj
T*(58 princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquesses, 26 Counts, one viscount and 79 barons; the )Tj
T*(Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility \(last published in 1926\) lists even )Tj
T*(more.[5] In addition to these were the younger scions of the families, with )Tj
T*(their courtesy titles of nobile or baron. )Tj
T*( Architecture was not the only legacy of the Normans. Rule over the peasants )Tj
T*(\(there was no established middle class\) was also enforced by a feudal system, )Tj
T*(unchanged since its introduction following the Norman conquest of 1071. Thus )Tj
T*(the Sicilian aristocracy had not only wealth but vast manpower at their )Tj
T*(command, something that had by this time declined in many other parts of )Tj
T*(Europe. As in Southern Spain, the huge rural estates remained almost as )Tj
T*(concentrated as when they had been Roman "latifundi". The Sicilian economy, )Tj
T*(though very largely agriculturally based, was very strong, and became more so )Tj
T*(during the 18th century as shipping became more efficient and the threat of )Tj
T*(Muslim piracy died away. The export markets for lemons \(for the great 18th )Tj
T*(century fashion for lemonade\) and wines increased greatly, and Sicilian wheat )Tj
T*(remained, as it had been since Roman times, the backbone of the economy. The )Tj
T*(disaster that was to give Sicily its modern reputation of poverty, namely the )Tj
T*(opening-up of the American Middle West to wheat-farming, was a century away. )Tj

T*(When it came, this permanently more than halved the price of wheat, and )Tj
T*(destroyed the old economy forever. )Tj
T*( The aristocracy shared their power only with the Roman Catholic Church. The )Tj
T*(Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in )Tj
T*(the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously )Tj
T*(as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops were members )Tj
T*(of the aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by )Tj
T*(the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter )Tj
T*(monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from )Tj
T*(division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate )Tj
T*(this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain )Tj
T*(religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other )Tj
T*(group at this time. This is one of the reasons that so many of the Sicilian )Tj
T*(Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt )Tj
T*(after 1693 on such a lavish scale. )Tj
T*( Once rebuilding began, the poor rebuilt their basic housing in the same )Tj
T*(primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both )Tj
T*(secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most )Tj
T*(members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily.[6] For one thing, the )Tj
T*(Spanish viceroy spent six months of the year in Palermo and six in Catania, )Tj
T*(holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town )Tj
T*(palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in )Tj
T*(the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so )Tj
T*(they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th )Tj
T*(century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were )Tj
T*(built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a )Tj
T*(smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a )Tj
T*(more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat )Tj
T*(than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building )Tj
T*(mania. Often Baroque wings or new fa√ßades were added to ancient castles, or )Tj
T*(country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained )Tj
T*(momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by )Tj
T*(these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century. )Tj
T*( [edit] New cities )Tj
T*( Following the quake a program of rebuilding was rapidly put into action, but )Tj
T*(before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently )Tj
T*(differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban )Tj
T*(developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town )Tj
T*(planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped )Tj
T*(narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, )Tj
T*(often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric )Tj
T*(shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque )Tj
T*(town planning. )Tj
T*( This concept was still very new in the 1690s, and few new cities had had )Tj
T*(reason to be built in Europe - Christopher Wren's city plan after the Great )Tj
T*(Fire of London in 1666 having been turned down because of the complexities of )Tj
T*(land ownership there.There were some other examples such as Richelieu, )Tj
T*(Indre-et-Loire, and later Saint Petersburg. The prototype may well have been )Tj
T*(the new city of Terra del Sole, constructed in 1564. Another of the first towns )Tj
T*(to be planned using symmetry and order rather than an evolution of small alleys )Tj
T*(and streets was Alessandria in southern Piedmont. A little later, from 1711, )Tj
T*(this Baroque form of planning was favoured in the Hispanic colonies of South )Tj
T*(America, especially by the Portuguese in Brazil. In other parts of Europe, lack )Tj
T*(of finance, complex land ownership and divided public opinion made radical )Tj
T*(replanning after disaster too difficult: after 1666, London was rebuilt on its )Tj
T*(ancient plan, though new extensions to the west were partially on a grid )Tj
T*(system. In Sicily, public opinion \(the public being anyone not a member of the )Tj
T*(ruling class\) counted for nothing, and hence these seemingly revolutionary new )Tj
T*(concepts of town planning could be freely executed. )Tj

T*(because it would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused )Tj
T*(in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings )Tj
T*(to collapse together like dominoes \(a hazard that was to remain in the still )Tj
T*(cramped and narrow areas housing the poor\). Architecturally and aesthetically, )Tj
T*(the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many )Tj
T*(Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental )Tj
T*(Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in )Tj
T*(urban Baroque design one can step back and actually see the architecture in a )Tj
T*(more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is )Tj
T*(most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di )Tj
T*(Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli. )Tj
T*( One of the finest examples of this new urban planning can be seen at Noto )Tj
T*(\(Illustration 9\), the town rebuilt approximately 10¬†km from its original site )Tj
T*(on Mount Alveria. The old ruined town now known as "Noto Antica" can still be )Tj
T*(viewed in its ruinous state. The new site chosen was flatter than the old to )Tj
T*(better facilitate a linear grid-like plan. The principal streets run east to )Tj
T*(west so they would benefit from a better light and a sunnier disposition. This )Tj
T*(example of town planning is directly attributable to a learned local )Tj
T*(aristocrat, Giovanni Battista Landolina; helped by three local architects, he )Tj
T*(is credited with planning the new city himself. )Tj
T*( In these new towns, the aristocracy was allocated the higher areas, where the )Tj
T*(air was cooler and fresher and the views finest. The church was allocated the )Tj
T*(town centre \(Illustration 8\), for convenience to all, and to reflect the )Tj
T*(church's global and central position; round the pairing of cathedral and )Tj
T*(episcopal Palazzo Vescovile were built the convents. The merchants and )Tj
T*(storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the )Tj
T*(main piazzas. Finally, the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts )Tj
T*(and houses in the areas nobody else wanted. Lawyers, doctors, and members of )Tj
T*(the few professions including the more skilled artisans - those who fell )Tj
T*(between the strictly defined upper and lower class - and were able to afford )Tj
T*(building plots, often lived on the periphery of the commercial and upper class )Tj
T*(residential sectors, but equally often these people just lived in a larger or )Tj
T*(grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas. However, many of the )Tj
T*(skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended )Tj
T*(households of their patrons. In this way Baroque town planning came to )Tj
T*(symbolize and reflect political authority, and later its style and philosophy )Tj
T*(spread as far as Annapolis and Savannah in English America, and perhaps most )Tj
T*(notably Haussmann's 19th century re-designing of Paris. The stage was now set )Tj
T*(for the explosion of Baroque architecture, which was to predominate in Sicily )Tj
T*(until the early 19th century. )Tj
T*( Later many other Sicilian towns and cities which had been either little )Tj
T*(damaged or completely untouched by the quake, such as Palermo, were also )Tj
T*(transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a )Tj
T*(palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent )Tj
T*(as that in the second city. In Palermo the Church of Santa Caterina, began in )Tj
T*(1566, was one of many in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century )Tj
T*(in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles. )Tj
T*( [edit] New churches and palazzi )Tj
T*( Of Sicily's own form of Baroque, post 1693, it has been said, "The buildings )Tj

T*(choice. As with all architectural styles, the selection of style would have )Tj

T*(Versailles seem a model of restraint. )Tj
T*( As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were employed to create the )Tj
T*(new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in )Tj
T*(a more sophisticated style than those of the late 17th century; many had been )Tj
T*(trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding )Tj
T*(of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. )Tj
T*(Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of )Tj
T*(engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down text with )Tj
T*(his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the )Tj
T*(principal Renaissance and Baroque fa√ßades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance )Tj
T*(finally came late to Sicily by proxy. )Tj
T*( At this stage of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of )Tj
T*(style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading )Tj
T*(Sicilian architect during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 )Tj
T*(bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and )Tj
T*(introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of )Tj
T*(curves, which would have been unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works )Tj
T*(are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come.[8] Notable works )Tj
T*(which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari )Tj
T*(at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this )Tj
T*(building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's )Tj
T*(Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that )Tj
T*(causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined )Tj
T*(and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next )Tj
T*(decades. )Tj
T*( A second hindrance to Sicilian architects' fully achieving their potential )Tj
T*(earlier was that frequently they were only rebuilding a damaged structure, and )Tj
T*(as a consequence having to match their designs to what had been before, or )Tj
T*(remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica \(Illustration 10\) is an )Tj
T*(example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a )Tj
T*(Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. )Tj
T*(Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario )Tj
T*(Gagliardi oversaw the fa√ßade's completion in 1760,[9] but the compromises he )Tj
T*(had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi )Tj
T*(used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in )Tj
T*(Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness )Tj
T*(of touch and freedom of design. )Tj
T*( There were also at this time other influences at work. Between 1718 and 1734 )Tj
T*(Sicily was ruled personally by Charles VI from Vienna, and as a result close )Tj
T*(ties with Austrian architecture can be perceived. Several buildings on the )Tj
T*(island are shameless imitations of the works of Fischer von Erlach.[10] One )Tj
T*(Sicilian architect, Tommaso Napoli, a monk, visited Vienna twice early in the )Tj
T*(century, returning with a store of engraving and drawings. He was later the )Tj
T*(architect of two country villas of the early Sicilian Baroque period, )Tj
T*(remarkable for their concave and convex walls and the complex design of their )Tj
T*(external staircases. One villa, his Villa Palagonia begun in 1705, is the most )Tj
T*(complex and ingenious of all constructed in Sicily's Baroque era; its double )Tj
T*(staircase of straight flights, frequently changing direction, was to be the )Tj
T*(prototype of a distinguishing feature of Sicilian Baroque. )Tj
T*( Later, a new wave of architects, who would master the Baroque sentiments, )Tj
T*(aware of Rococo interior styles beginning elsewhere to gain an ascendancy over )Tj
T*(Baroque, would go on to develop the flamboyance, freedom, and movement that are )Tj
T*(synonymous with the term Sicilian Baroque today. )Tj
T*( [edit] High Sicilian Baroque )Tj
T*( Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined )Tj
T*(Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two )Tj
T*(reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more )Tj
T*(leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects )Tj
T*(came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the )Tj
T*(Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books )Tj

T*(predecessors \(the former students of the Romans\), and consequently were able to )Tj
T*(formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, )Tj
T*(Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of )Tj
T*(Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and )Tj
T*(traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often )Tj

T*(repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is )Tj
T*(a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed )Tj
T*(amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the )Tj
T*(island". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the )Tj
T*(Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the )Tj
T*(island. Nowhere in Sicily is the development of the new Baroque style more )Tj
T*(evident than in Ragusa and Catania. )Tj
T*( [edit] Ragusa )Tj
T*( Ragusa was very badly damaged in 1693. The town is in two halves, divided by a )Tj
T*(deep ravine known as the "Valle dei Ponti": the older town of Ragusa Ibla, and )Tj
T*(the higher Ragusa Superiore. )Tj
T*( Ragusa Ibla, the lower city, boasts an impressive array of Baroque )Tj
T*(architecture, which includes the Church of San Giorgio by Rosario Gagliardi, )Tj
T*(designed in 1738 \(Illustration 12\). In the design of this church Gagliardi )Tj
T*(exploited the difficult terrain of the hillside site. The church towers )Tj
T*(impressively over a massive marble staircase of some 250 steps, a Baroque )Tj
T*(feature, especially exploited in Sicily due to the island's topography. The )Tj
T*(tower seems to explode from the fa√ßade, accentuated by the columns and )Tj
T*(pilasters canted against the curved walls. Above the doorways and window )Tj
T*(apertures, pediments scroll and curve with a sense of freedom and movement )Tj
T*(which would have been unthinkable to those earlier architects inspired by )Tj
T*(Bernini and Borromini. The neoclassical dome was not added until 1820. )Tj
T*( In an alley connecting Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore is the church of )Tj
T*(Santa Maria delle Scale. This church is interesting, though badly damaged in )Tj
T*(the earthquake. Only half the church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while the )Tj
T*(surviving half was kept in the original Norman \(with Gothic features\), thus )Tj
T*(demonstrating in one piece the evolution of Sicilian Baroque. )Tj
T*( The Palazzo Zacco is one of the more notable Baroque buildings of the city, )Tj
T*(its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work, while )Tj
T*(supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built )Tj
T*(in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It )Tj
T*(was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building )Tj
T*(has two street fa√ßades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms )Tj
T*(of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The )Tj
T*(balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels )Tj
T*(which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal )Tj
T*(points of the principal fa√ßade are the three central balconies, divided by )Tj
T*(columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of )Tj
T*(musicians with grotesque faces. )Tj
T*( The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore was built between )Tj
T*(1718 and 1778. Its principal fa√ßade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings )Tj
T*(and sculptures. The cathedral has a high Sicilian belfry in the same style. The )Tj
T*(ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles \(Illustration )Tj

T*(Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two )Tj
T*(storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch )Tj
T*(to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise )Tj
T*(damage in future earthquakes, is very different from the palazzi in Ragusa )Tj
T*(Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered on here )Tj
T*(until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque )Tj
T*(form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies. )Tj
T*( [edit] Catania )Tj
T*( Sicily's second city, Catania, was the most damaged of all the larger cities )Tj
T*(in 1693, with only the medieval Castello Ursino and three tribunes of the )Tj
T*(cathedral remaining. Thus it was replanned and rebuilt. The new design )Tj
T*(separated the city into quarters, divided by two roads meeting at an )Tj
T*(intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo \(Cathedral Square\). Rebuilding was )Tj
T*(supervised by the Bishop of Catania, and the city's only surviving architect, )Tj
T*(Alonzo di Benedetto. Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in )Tj
T*(from Messina, which quickly began to rebuild, concentrating first on the Piazza )Tj
T*(del Duomo. Three palazzi are situated here, the Bishop's Palace, the Seminario )Tj
T*(and one other. The architects worked in complete harmony and it is impossible )Tj
T*(to distinguish di Benedetto's work from that of his junior colleagues. The work )Tj
T*(is competent but not remarkable, with decorated rustication in the 17th-century )Tj
T*(Sicilian style, but often the decoration on the upper floors is superficial. )Tj
T*(This is typical of the Baroque of this period immediately after the earthquake. )Tj
T*( In 1730, Vaccarini arrived in Catania as the appointed city architect and )Tj
T*(immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The )Tj
T*(pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and )Tj
T*(entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. )Tj
T*(Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature )Tj
T*(rather than a general building material, using it intermittently with other )Tj
T*(materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported on the back of the )Tj
T*(Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of )Tj
T*(the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal fa√ßade to Catania's cathedral, )Tj
T*(dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even at this late )Tj
T*(stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the )Tj
T*(Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most )Tj
T*(stylistically simple. )Tj
T*( [edit] Church interiors )Tj
T*( Sicilian church exteriors had been decorated in elaborate styles from the )Tj
T*(first quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, )Tj
T*(frescoes, and marble \(Illustration 14\). As the post-earthquake churches were )Tj
T*(becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this )Tj
T*(external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense \(compare illustration 14 )Tj
T*(to the later interior of illustration 15\), with profuse sculpted ornamentation )Tj
T*(of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and )Tj
T*(fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one )Tj
T*(of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels )Tj
T*(of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of )Tj
T*(Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The )Tj
T*(high altar is usually the pi√®ce de resistance: in many instances a single block )Tj
T*(of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset )Tj
T*(with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar )Tj
T*(dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many )Tj
T*(cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of )Tj
T*(this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo. )Tj
T*( The building of Sicily's churches would typically be funded not just by )Tj
T*(individual religious orders but also by an aristocratic family. Contrary to )Tj
T*(popular belief, the majority of Sicily's nobility did not choose to have their )Tj
T*(mortal remains displayed for eternity in the Capuchin catacombs of Palermo, but )Tj
T*(were buried quite conventionally in vaults beneath their family churches. It )Tj
T*(has been said, though, that "the funeral of a Sicilian aristocrat was one of )Tj
T*(the great moments of his life".[11]Funerals became tremendous shows of wealth; )Tj

T*(a result of this ostentation was that the stone memorial slabs covering the )Tj
T*(burial vaults today provide an accurate barometer of the development of Baroque )Tj
T*(and marble inlay techniques at any specific time. For instance, those from the )Tj
T*(first half of the 17th century are of simple white marble decorated with an )Tj
T*(incised armorial bearing, name, date, etc. From c. 1650, small quantities of )Tj
T*(coloured marble inlay appear, forming patterns, and this can be studied )Tj
T*(developing until, by the end of the century, the coats of arms and calligraphy )Tj
T*(are entirely of inset coloured marble, with decorative patterned borders. Long )Tj
T*(after Baroque began to fall from fashion in the 1780s, Baroque decor was still )Tj
T*(deemed more suitable for Catholic ritual than the new pagan-based )Tj
T*(neoclassicism. )Tj
T*( The Church of San Benedetto in Catania \(Illustrations 15 and 16\) is a fine )Tj
T*(example of a Sicilian Baroque interior, decorated between 1726 and 1762, the )Tj
T*(period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and )Tj
T*(individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The )Tj
T*(most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir )Tj
T*(\(Illustrations 16\), created c. 1750, which was designed in such a way that the )Tj
T*(nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns themselves were still )Tj
T*(quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside. )Tj
T*( [edit] Palazzi interiors )Tj
T*( With but a few notable exceptions, the interiors of the palazzi were from the )Tj
T*(start less elaborate than those of Sicily's Baroque churches. Many were )Tj
T*(finished without ornate interior decoration, simply because they took so long )Tj
T*(to build and by the time they were completed Baroque had passed from fashion; )Tj
T*(the principal rooms were therefore decorated in the new neoclassical style )Tj
T*(known as "Pompeian". Often one can find a fusion of the two styles, as in the )Tj
T*(ballroom wing of the Palazzo Aiutamicristo in Palermo, built by Andrea Giganti )Tj
T*(in 1763, where the ballroom ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe Cristadoro with )Tj
T*(allegorical scenes framed by Baroque gilded motifs in plaster. This ceiling was )Tj
T*(already old-fashioned when it was finished, and the rest of the room was )Tj
T*(decorated in a far simpler mode.[12] Changing use over the past 250 years has )Tj
T*(simplified palazzo decor further, as the ground floors are now usually shops, )Tj
T*(banks, or restaurants, and the upper floors divided into apartments, their )Tj
T*(interiors lost. )Tj
T*( A further reason for the absence of Baroque decoration, and the most common, )Tj
T*(is that most rooms were never intended for such decoration. Many of the palazzi )Tj
T*(were vast, meant for huge numbers of people. The household of the Sicilian )Tj
T*(aristocrat, beginning with himself, his wife and many children, would typically )Tj
T*(also contain a collection of poorer relatives and other extended family )Tj
T*(members, all of whom had minor apartments in the house. Moreover there were )Tj
T*(paid employees, often including a private chaplain or confessor, a major domo, )Tj
T*(governesses, secretary, archivist, accountant, librarian, and innumerable lower )Tj
T*(servants, such as a porter to ring a bell a prescribed number of times )Tj
T*(according to the rank of an approaching guest. Often the servants' extended )Tj
T*(families, especially if elderly, also lived in the palazzo. Thus many rooms )Tj
T*(were needed to house the household. These everyday living quarters, even for )Tj
T*(the "Maestro and Maestra di Casa", were often simply decorated and furnished. )Tj
T*(Further rooms were required by the Sicilian tradition that it was a sign of )Tj
T*(poor breeding to permit even mere acquaintances to stay in local inns. Any )Tj
T*(visiting foreigner, especially an Englishman, was regarded as a special trophy )Tj
T*(and added social prestige. Hence the Sicilian aristocrat's home was seldom )Tj
T*(empty or quiet. )Tj
T*( As in the rest of Italy, the finest and most decorated rooms were those on the )Tj
T*(piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the )Tj
T*(external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large )Tj
T*(and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the )Tj
T*(house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here )Tj
T*(too, but by the end of the 18th century they were more often on a secondary )Tj
T*(floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely )Tj
T*(ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded )Tj

T*(moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were )Tj
T*(high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of )Tj
T*(Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors )Tj
T*(adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery )Tj
T*(of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi \(Illustration 17\). This room )Tj
T*(with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few )Tj
T*(Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was \(from 1750\) extended and )Tj
T*(transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical )Tj
T*(style.[13] )Tj
T*( Furniture during the Baroque era was in keeping with the style: ornate, gilded )Tj
T*(and frequently with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient )Tj
T*(within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving )Tj
T*(other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for )Tj
T*(a certain room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. As )Tj
T*(in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a )Tj
T*(wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later )Tj
T*(conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was )Tj
T*(always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, )Tj
T*(patterned floor tiles. )Tj
T*( The common element to both church and palazzi interior design was the stucco )Tj
T*(work. Stucco is an important component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as )Tj
T*(it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in )Tj
T*(three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and walls )Tj
T*(in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches )Tj
T*(the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a )Tj
T*(private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical )Tj
T*(instruments. )Tj
T*( [edit] Final period )Tj
T*( As with all architectural styles, people eventually tired of Baroque. In some )Tj
T*(parts of Europe, it metamorphosed into the rococo, but not in Sicily. No longer )Tj
T*(ruled by Austria, Sicily, from 1735 officially the Kingdom of Sicily, was ruled )Tj
T*(by the King of Naples, Ferdinand IV. Hence Palermo was in constant association )Tj
T*(with the principal capital Naples, where there was architecturally a growing )Tj
T*(reversion to the more classical styles of architecture. Coupled with this, many )Tj
T*(of the more cultured Sicilian nobility developed a fashionable obsession with )Tj
T*(all things French, from philosophy to arts, fashion, and architecture. Many of )Tj
T*(them visited Paris in pursuit of these interests and returned with the latest )Tj
T*(architectural engravings and theoretical treatises. The French architect L√©on )Tj
T*(Dufourny was in Sicily between 1787 and 1794 to study and analyse the ancient )Tj
T*(Greek temples on the island. Thus Sicilians rediscovered their ancient past, )Tj
T*(which with its classical idioms was now the height of fashion. The change in )Tj
T*(tastes did not come about overnight. Baroque remained popular on the island, )Tj
T*(but now Sicilian balconies, extravagant as ever, would be placed next to severe )Tj
T*(classical columns. Dufourny began designing in Palermo, and his "Entrance )Tj
T*(Temple" \(1789\) to the Botanical Gardens was the first building in Sicily in a )Tj
T*(style based on the Greek Doric order. It is pure neoclassical architecture, as )Tj
T*(established in England since 1760, and it was a sign of things to come. )Tj
T*( It was Dufourny's great friend and fellow architect Giuseppe Marvuglia who was )Tj
T*(to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque. In 1784 he designed )Tj
T*(the Palazzo Riso-Belmonte, the finest example of this period of architectural )Tj
T*(transition, combining both Baroque and Palladian motifs, built around an )Tj
T*(arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade, or )Tj
T*(chiaroscuro.[14] The main fa√ßade, punctuated by giant pilasters, also had )Tj
T*(Baroque features, but the skyline was unbroken. The pilasters were undecorated, )Tj
T*(simple, and Ionic, and supported an undecorated entablature. Above the windows )Tj
T*(were classical unbroken pediments. Sicilian Baroque was waning. )Tj
T*( Another reason for the gradual decline in the development of Sicily's Baroque )Tj
T*(and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th )Tj

T*(and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the )Tj
T*(18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular )Tj
T*(Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their )Tj
T*(town palazzi grew in size and splendour, to the detriment of the abandoned )Tj
T*(estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left )Tj
T*(to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. )Tj
T*(Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using )Tj
T*(the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the )Tj
T*(money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable )Tj
T*(politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak )Tj
T*(Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife, Sicily had declined to the point of no )Tj
T*(return long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the )Tj
T*(invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were kept at bay from )Tj
T*(Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and Sicily was )Tj
T*(now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 )Tj
T*(imposed the first taxes, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy. )Tj
T*( The tax was rescinded by the British in 1812, who then imposed a British style )Tj
T*(constitution on the island. One legal innovation of this time of particular )Tj
T*(consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only )Tj
T*(been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could )Tj
T*(now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at )Tj
T*(auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to )Tj
T*(flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, )Tj
T*(and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with the social and )Tj
T*(political upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the )Tj
T*(Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect )Tj
T*(and dereliction of noblesse oblige, an essential element of the feudal system, )Tj
T*(the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and )Tj
T*(the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian )Tj
T*(upper class was over. )Tj
T*( However, the British influence in Sicily was to provide Sicilian Baroque with )Tj
T*(one last flourish. Marvuglia, recognising the new fashion for all things )Tj
T*(British, developed the style he had first cautiously used at Palazzo )Tj
T*(Riso-Belmonte in 1784, combining some of the plainer, more solid elements of )Tj
T*(Baroque with Palladian motifs rather than Palladian designs. The late Sicilian )Tj
T*(Baroque was similar in style to the Baroque popular in England at the beginning )Tj
T*(of the 18th century, popularised by Sir John Vanbrugh with such edifices as )Tj
T*(Blenheim Palace. An example is Marvuglia's Church of San Francesco di Sales, )Tj
T*(which is almost English in its interpretation of Baroque. However, this was a )Tj
T*(temporary success and the neoclassical style was soon dominant. Few aristocrats )Tj
T*(could now afford to build, and the new style was mainly used in public and )Tj
T*(civil buildings such as those at the Botanical Gardens in Palermo. Sicilian )Tj
T*(architects ‚Äî even Andrea Giganti, once a competent architect in Baroque ‚Äî now )Tj
T*(began to design in the neoclassical style, but in this case in the version of )Tj
T*(the neoclassical adopted by fashionable France. Giganti's Villa Galletti at )Tj
T*(Bagheria is clearly inspired by the work of Ange-Jacques Gabriel. )Tj
T*( As with the early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first buildings of the new )Tj
T*(neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo )Tj
T*(Ducezio \(Illustration 19\) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades )Tj
T*(creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years )Tj
T*(later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments )Tj
T*(above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, )Tj
T*(highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and )Tj
T*(slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism. )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Sicilian Baroque is today recognised as an architectural style, largely due to )Tj

T*(ancestral palazzo still today. Thanks to the continuing religious devotion of )Tj
T*(the Sicilian people many of the Sicilian Baroque churches are today still in )Tj
T*(the use for which they were designed. )Tj
T*( However, much of the blame for the decay and ruinous state of preservation of )Tj
T*(so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but )Tj
T*(the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest )Tj
T*(Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of )Tj

T*(1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. )Tj
T*(Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices )Tj
T*(or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold. )Tj
T*( The remaining members of the Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their )Tj
T*(ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism a major )Tj
T*(source of income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The )Tj
T*(local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less )Tj

T*(be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage. )Tj
T*( As Sicily now becomes a more politically stable, secure and less corrupt )Tj
T*(environment, the Baroque palazzi are slowly beginning to open their doors to an )Tj
T*(eager paying public, American and Northern European as much as Italian. In )Tj
T*(1963, when the movie The Leopard was released the Gangi Palace ballroom was )Tj

T*(Although it faced numerous legal challenges and was condemned by the National )Tj

T*(spread across various Monogram Pictures lots; co-producer J. S. Jossey was a )Tj
T*(Monogram stockholder. On January 3, 1945, Mom and Dad premiered at the Warner )Tj
T*(Bros. theatre in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.[2] )Tj
T*( The plot is padded with a large amount of filler. Films of this type were )Tj
T*(usually produced quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes )Tj
T*(used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its )Tj
T*(running time to qualify for feature length status. Eric Schaefer notes that the )Tj
T*("primary purpose" of the plot of Mom and Dad was to "serve as the vehicle onto )Tj
T*(which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted", such as the live )Tj
T*(birth scene. The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many )Tj
T*(posters for the film promised that "You [will] actually SEE the birth of a )Tj
T*(baby!"[9] The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather )Tj
T*(than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time. In )Tj
T*(particular, at no time does the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or )Tj
T*(pregnancy.[8] )Tj
T*( Mom and Dad tells the story of Joan Blake \(June Carlson\), a young girl who )Tj
T*(falls for the pilot Jack Griffin \(Bob Lowell\). After being sweet talked by )Tj
T*(Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests "hygiene books" from her )Tj
T*(mother Sarah Blake \(Lois Austin\); however, the mother refuses because the girl )Tj
T*(is not yet married. The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake \(George )Tj
T*(Eldredge\) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had )Tj
T*(been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission. )Tj
T*( The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no )Tj
T*(longer fit, sending her into a state of despair. She takes advice from her )Tj
T*(teacher, Carl Blackburn \(Hardie Albright\), who had previously been fired for )Tj
T*(teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and )Tj
T*(accuses her of "neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real )Tj
T*(truth." Only then is the girl able to confront her mother.[2][8] )Tj
T*( The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the )Tj
T*(female anatomy and footage of live births - one natural and one Caesarian. In )Tj
T*(some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained )Tj
T*(images portraying syphilis and venereal disease. Mom and Dad is believed to )Tj
T*(have had a number of endings, although most typically concluded with the birth )Tj
T*(of the girl's child, sometimes stillborn and other times put up for )Tj

T*(city, who wished to register concern about local young women in his area who )Tj
T*(had seen the film and were awakened enough to discuss problems similar to their )Tj
T*(own.[12] )Tj
T*( The campaigns were usually orchestrated by employees of either Hygienic or )Tj
T*(Hallmark Productions,[8] and they nominally based their campaign from )Tj
T*(information provided by a standard and detailed pressbook containing cast and )Tj
T*(crew information, as well as other promotional and marketing materials.[2] )Tj
T*(Babb's marketing strategy centered on overwhelming small towns with )Tj
T*(advertisements and letters, in an attempt to create a controversial atmosphere. )Tj
T*(In keeping with his motto of "You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em,"[2] the film )Tj
T*(became so ubiquitous that Time wrote that its presentation "left only the )Tj
T*(livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life."[4] )Tj
T*( The local pitch included a variety of limited screenings, including )Tj
T*(adults-only showings, viewings segregated by gender, and a live lecture by the )Tj
T*("Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes" which was often placed during the )Tj
T*(intermission. At any one time, a number of "Elliot Forbes"es would give )Tj
T*(simultaneous talks in a number of locations showing the film.[13] In some )Tj
T*(predominantly African-American areas, Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens was )Tj
T*(hired to make appearances instead of an actor playing Forbes.[8] The "Elliot )Tj
T*(Forbes" actors were usually people local to the production company, sometimes )Tj
T*(out-of-work performers.[14] Along with "Forbes", presentations were often held )Tj
T*(with "nurses" in attendance, ostensibly in the event that someone fainted due )Tj
T*(to the content of the film;[8] such "nurses" were often hired locally.[15] )Tj
T*( Modern Film Distributors later distributed the film, and sold over forty-five )Tj
T*(thousand copies of the books Man and Boy and Woman and Girl following Forbes's )Tj
T*(lecture. The text was written by Babb's wife,[16] and was filled with both )Tj
T*(biological and sexual education materials relevant to the film's subject )Tj
T*(matter; generating extra profit items for their distributors. The sales of )Tj
T*(these books netted an estimated $31,000 for the distribution company,[17] while )Tj
T*(Babb estimated the total sales for all distributions at 40 million copies.[16] )Tj
T*( Babb insisted that the program be followed closely; a contractual agreement )Tj
T*(with theaters required that each presentation follow a similar approach. )Tj
T*(Because the Forbes lecture formed part of the viewing, extra newsreels or short )Tj
T*(films were not permitted, although previews were allowed. A contractual )Tj
T*(agreement disallowed matin√©e pricing, set specific times for the segregated )Tj
T*(viewings, and prohibited the screening of the film on Sundays.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception )Tj
T*( It is claimed that Mom and Dad is the third highest grossing film of the 1940s )Tj
T*(in dollar value,[4] and returned close to $63 for each dollar invested by its )Tj
T*(backers.[18] The Los Angeles Times estimates that the film grossed between $40 )Tj
T*(million and $100 million,[11] and it has been cited as the most successful sex )Tj
T*(hygiene film ever released. It remains the most profitable pre-1960 )Tj
T*(exploitation film; ranking among the top ten grossing films of both the 1940s )Tj
T*(and 1950s, even when scaled against those year's mainstream releases.[19] )Tj
T*( The film was at the center of many high profile lawsuits and condemnations. )Tj
T*(The exploitation genre was pitched against numerous challenges during the 1940s )Tj
T*(and 1950s, and fought many local censorship battles, and fought bitterly )Tj
T*(against the motion picture censorship system.[20] It has been claimed that )Tj
T*(nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb and Mom and Dad during the )Tj
T*(film's run.[11] Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as )Tj
T*(an offer of defense, and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his )Tj
T*(pressbooks. One successful challenge was in New York City, where Mom and Dad )Tj
T*(remained censored until 1956, when the Appellate Division of the New York State )Tj
T*(Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board, deciding that )Tj
T*(human birth did not qualify as "indecent".[21] )Tj
T*( According to Modern Film Distributors, as of the end of 1956, the film has )Tj
T*(been dubbed into a dozen languages and attended by an estimated worldwide )Tj
T*(attendance figure of over 175 million people, at over 650,000 )Tj

T*(film's debut.[14] In the late 1970s, a story on Babb by the Press-Enterprise )Tj
T*(estimated that the film had been dubbed into 18 languages.[16] )Tj
T*( The film's success spawned a number of imitators, who sought to saturate the )Tj
T*(market with genre imitations. In particular, Street Corner recycled Babb's )Tj
T*(plot, substituting a concerned physician for a concerned teacher. In 1948, )Tj
T*(Universal produced a similar film, The Story of Bob and Sally, but was unable )Tj
T*(to screen it due to the production code, and eventually sold the rights.[22] )Tj
T*(The volume of imitations led to the formation of Modern Film Distributors, a )Tj
T*(group of exploitation filmmakers, in an effort to minimize booking )Tj
T*(conflicts.[8] )Tj
T*( In 1969, the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America )Tj
T*(for a film rating, in order to allow the film be shown in traditional movie )Tj
T*(theaters; it received an R rating.[23][24] The movie was such a success that it )Tj

T*( Trafford is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. With an )Tj
T*(estimated population of about 211,800 in 2006,[2] it covers 41 square miles )Tj
T*(\(106¬†km2\)[3] and includes the towns of Altrincham, Partington, Sale, Stretford, )Tj
T*(and Urmston. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act )Tj
T*(1972 as a merger of the municipal boroughs of Altrincham, Sale, and Stretford, )Tj
T*(the urban districts of Bowdon, Hale, and Urmston and part of Bucklow Rural )Tj
T*(District. All were previously in Cheshire, apart from Stretford and Urmston )Tj
T*(which were in Lancashire. The River Mersey flows through the borough, )Tj
T*(separating North Trafford from South Trafford. Historically the Mersey also )Tj
T*(acted as the boundary between the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. )Tj
T*( The Trafford area has a long heritage, with evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, )Tj
T*(and Roman activity. Amongst the relics of the past are two castles¬†‚Äì one of )Tj
T*(them a Scheduled Ancient Monument¬†‚Äì and over 200 listed buildings. The area )Tj
T*(underwent change in the late 19th century and the population rapidly expanded )Tj
T*(with the arrival of the railway. Trafford is the home of Manchester United F.C. )Tj
T*(and Lancashire County Cricket Club and since 2002 the Imperial War Museum )Tj
T*(North. )Tj
T*( Trafford has a strong economy with low levels of unemployment and contains )Tj
T*(both Trafford Park industrial estate and the Trafford Centre, a large )Tj
T*(out-of-town shopping centre. Apart from the City of Manchester, Trafford is the )Tj
T*(only borough in Greater Manchester to be above the national average for weekly )Tj
T*(income. Socially, the area includes both working class areas like Old Trafford )Tj
T*(and Stretford and middle class ones such as Bowdon and Hale. Altrincham and )Tj
T*(Sale West is one of the two parliamentary constituencies in Greater Manchester )Tj
T*(to be held by the Conservative Party, the other being Bury North. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The choice of the name Trafford for the borough was a "compromise between )Tj
T*(Altrincham, Stretford and Sale", and "seemed to have wide support".[4] A )Tj
T*(Liberal councillor for the Municipal Borough of Sale suggested "Crossford¬†... )Tj
T*(whilst "Watlingford" was suggested by councillors in Hale, after the supposed )Tj
T*(name of an ancient Roman road in the district.[4] Those names were rejected in )Tj
T*(favour of Trafford, because of the district's "famous sports venue, a major )Tj
T*(employer as well as historic associations", referring to Old Trafford \(cricket )Tj
T*(and football\), Trafford Park and the de Trafford baronets respectively.[4] )Tj
T*( As a place name, Trafford is an Anglo-French version of Stratford, deriving )Tj
T*(from the Old English words str√¶t \(a street, more specifically a Roman road\) and )Tj
T*(ford \(a river crossing\). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since )Tj
T*(1974, but the area it covers has a long history. Neolithic arrowheads have been )Tj
T*(discovered in Altrincham and Sale,[5] and there is evidence of Bronze Age )Tj
T*(habitation in Timperley.[6] Fragments of Roman pottery have been found in )Tj
T*(Urmston, and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman road between the )Tj

T*(Trafford, passing through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham.[7] The settlements )Tj
T*(in Trafford have been based largely around agriculture, although Altrincham was )Tj
T*(probably founded as a market town.[8] Although the Industrial Revolution )Tj
T*(affected Trafford, the area did not experience the same rate of growth as the )Tj
T*(rest of Greater Manchester.[9] A 100% increase in population in the Trafford )Tj
T*(area between 1841 and 1861 was a direct result of an influx due to the )Tj
T*(construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, which )Tj

T*(constructions is the keep of Rochester Castle. Towards the end of his life )Tj
T*(William was instrumental in the selection of Count Stephen of Boulogne as King )Tj
T*(of England, despite his oath to the dying King Henry I that he would support )Tj
T*(the succession of his daughter, the Empress Matilda. Although some chroniclers )Tj
T*(considered him a perjurer and a traitor for crowning Stephen, none doubted his )Tj
T*(piety. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( William de Corbeil was probably born at Corbeil on the Seine, possibly in )Tj
T*(about 1070.[1] He was educated at Laon,[2] where he studied under Anselm of )Tj
T*(Laon, the noted scholastic and teacher of theology.[3] William taught for a )Tj
T*(time at Laon,[2] but nothing else is known of his early life.[4] All that is )Tj
T*(known of his parents or ancestry is that he had two brothers, Ranulf and )Tj
T*(Helgot;[1] his brothers appear as witnesses on William's charters.[5] )Tj
T*( William joined the service of Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, as a clerk, )Tj
T*(and was present at the translation of the body of Saint Cuthbert in 1104.[1] )Tj
T*(His name appears high in a list of those who were present at the event, )Tj
T*(implying that he may have held an important position in Flambard's household, )Tj
T*(but appended to his name is "subsequently archbishop", suggesting that his )Tj
T*(inclusion could have been a later interpolation. He was a teacher to Flambard's )Tj
T*(children, probably in about 1107 to 1109,[6] but at some unknown date William )Tj
T*(appears to have transferred to the household of the Archbishop of Canterbury. )Tj
T*(Between 1107 and 1112 he went to Laon and attended lectures given by Anselm of )Tj
T*(Laon.[1] By 1116 he was a clerk for Ralph d'Escures, Archbishop of Canterbury, )Tj
T*(with whom he travelled to Rome in 1117 when Ralph was in dispute with Thurstan, )Tj
T*(the Archbishop of York, over the primacy of Canterbury.[7] )Tj
T*( In 1118, William entered the Augustinian order at Holy Trinity Priory in )Tj
T*(Aldgate,[1] a house of canons rather than monks.[8] Subsequently he became )Tj
T*(prior of the Augustinian priory at St Osyth in Essex,[9][10] appointed by )Tj
T*(Richard de Beaumis, Bishop of London, in 1121.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Election as archbishop )Tj
T*( After the death of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to )Tj
T*(allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of )Tj
T*(the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular.[11][a] The monks of the cathedral )Tj
T*(chapter and the bishops of the kingdom disagreed on who should be appointed. )Tj
T*(The bishops insisted that it should not be a clerk \(a non-monastic member of )Tj
T*(the clergy\), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and )Tj
T*(insisted that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only )Tj
T*(two bishops in England or Normandy were monks \(Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and )Tj
T*(Serlo, Bishop of S√©ez\), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, )Tj
T*(and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; )Tj
T*(recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk.[7] King Henry sided with the )Tj
T*(bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short )Tj
T*(list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no )Tj
T*(monks.[12] )Tj
T*( On 2 February[13] or 4 February 1123,[14] William was chosen from among four )Tj
T*(candidates to the see of Canterbury; the names of the three unsuccessful )Tj
T*(candidates are unknown.[7] He appears to have been a compromise candidate, as )Tj
T*(he was at least a canon, if not the monk that the chapter had sought.[15] )Tj
T*(William was the first Augustinian canon to become an archbishop in England, a )Tj
T*(striking break with the tradition that had favoured monks in the see of )Tj
T*(Canterbury.[16] Although most contemporaries would not have considered there to )Tj
T*(be much of a distinction between monks and canons, William's election still )Tj
T*(occasioned some trepidation among the monks of the Canterbury chapter, who were )Tj
T*("alarmed at the appointment, since he was a clerk".[17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Primacy dispute )Tj
T*( William, like every other Canterbury archbishop since Lanfranc, maintained )Tj
T*(that Canterbury held primacy‚Äîin essence, overlordship‚Äîover all other dioceses )Tj
T*(in Great Britain, including the archbishopric of York.[12] Thurstan had claimed )Tj
T*(independence,[18] and refused to consecrate William when the latter demanded )Tj
T*(recognition of Canterbury's primacy; the ceremony was performed instead by )Tj

T*(William's own suffragan bishops on 18¬†February 1123.[12][14] Previous popes had )Tj
T*(generally favoured York's side of the dispute, and the successive popes Paschal )Tj
T*(II, Gelasius II, and Calixtus II had issued rulings in the late 1110s and early )Tj
T*(1120s siding with York. Calixtus had also consecrated Thurstan when both King )Tj
T*(Henry and William's predecessor had attempted to prevent Thurstan's )Tj
T*(consecration unless Thurstan submitted to Canterbury.[19] )Tj
T*( After travelling to Rome to receive his pallium, the symbol of his authority )Tj
T*(as an archbishop, William discovered that Thurstan had arrived before him, and )Tj
T*(had presented a case against William's election to Pope Callixtus II.[1] There )Tj
T*(were four objections to William's election: first that he was elected in the )Tj
T*(king's court; second that the chapter of Canterbury had been coerced and was )Tj
T*(unwilling; third that his consecration was unlawful because it was not )Tj
T*(performed by Thurstan; and fourth that a monk should be elected to the see of )Tj
T*(Canterbury, which had been founded by Augustine of Canterbury, a monk.[7] )Tj
T*(However, King Henry I and the Emperor Henry IV, Henry I's son-in-law, persuaded )Tj
T*(the pope to overlook the irregularities of the election, with the proviso that )Tj
T*(William swore to obey "all things that the Pope imposed upon him."[12][20] At )Tj
T*(the conclusion of the visit the pope denied the primacy of Canterbury over )Tj
T*(York, dismissing the Canterbury cathedral chapter's supposed papal documents as )Tj
T*(forgeries.[7] The outcome was in accordance with most earlier papal rulings on )Tj
T*(the primacy issue, which involved not taking sides and thus reinforcing papal )Tj
T*(supremacy. William returned to England, and was enthroned at Canterbury on 22¬†)Tj
T*(July 1123.[1] )Tj
T*( The archbishop's next opponent was the papal legate of the new Pope Honorius )Tj
T*(II, Cardinal John of Crema,[20] who arrived in England in 1125. A compromise )Tj
T*(between York and Canterbury was negotiated, which involved Canterbury allowing )Tj
T*(York the supervision of the dioceses of Bangor, Chester, and St Aspah in return )Tj
T*(for Thurstan's verbal submission and the written submission of his successors. )Tj
T*(The pope, however, rejected the agreement, likely because he wished to preserve )Tj
T*(his own primacy, and substituted his own.[1] The papal solution was that )Tj
T*(Honorius would appoint William papal legate in England and Scotland, which was )Tj
T*(done in 1126,[21] giving William the position over York, but it was dependent )Tj
T*(on the will of the pope, and would lapse on the pope's death. The arrangement )Tj
T*(merely postponed the problem however, as neither Thurstan nor William renounced )Tj
T*(their claims. That Christmas, at a royal court, Thurstan unsuccessfully )Tj
T*(attempted to claim the right to ceremonially crown the king as well as have his )Tj
T*(episcopal cross carried before him in Canterbury's province.[1] As a result of )Tj
T*(his lengthy dispute with Thurstan, William travelled to Rome more frequently )Tj
T*(than any bishop before him except for Wilfrid in the 7th century.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] Archiepiscopal activities )Tj
T*( Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 were held in Westminster, the last )Tj
T*(two called by Archbishop William.[1] The council of 1125 met under the )Tj
T*(direction of John of Crema and prohibited simony, purchase of the sacraments, )Tj
T*(and the inheritance of clerical benefices.[23] John of Crema had been sent to )Tj
T*(England not only to seek a compromise in the Canterbury-York dispute, but to )Tj
T*(publicize the decrees of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which )Tj
T*(neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the )Tj
T*(rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or prebend, which was a source of )Tj
T*(consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in )Tj
T*(clergy's households unless they were relatives.[1] In 1127 the council )Tj
T*(condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic )Tj
T*(houses.[24] It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to give up )Tj
T*(their wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any )Tj
T*(such women who did not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled )Tj
T*(and even forced into slavery.[1] Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more )Tj
T*(admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives.[23] This )Tj
T*(council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the )Tj
T*(prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to pay a fine to the royal )Tj
T*(treasury in order to keep their women. William's allowance of this royal fine )Tj
T*(was condemned by the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon.[1] The festival of the )Tj

T*(Conception was also allowed at one of these councils.[24] )Tj
T*( As well as the councils, William was active in his diocese, and was interested )Tj
T*(in reforming the churches in his diocese. A conlict with Alexander of Lincoln )Tj
T*(over a church in Alexander's diocese led to further condemnation by Henry of )Tj
T*(Huntingon[1] and prompted Henry to write that "no one can sing [William's] )Tj
T*(praises because there's nothing to sing about."[25] William seems to have been )Tj
T*(somewhat eclipsed in ecclesiastical administration and appointments by Roger of )Tj
T*(Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury, and King Henry's primary advisor.[26] William )Tj
T*(reformed the nunnery of Minster-in-Sheppey however, and he installed a college )Tj
T*(of regular canons at the church of St. Gregory's, in Canterbury. He also )Tj
T*(secured a profession of obedience from the newly installed abbot of St )Tj
T*(Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury.[1] His legateship from Honorius lapsed when )Tj
T*(the pope died in February 1130, but it was renewed by Honorius' successor Pope )Tj
T*(Innocent II in 1132.[13] )Tj
T*( During William's last years he attempted to reform St Martin's, Dover. The )Tj
T*(king had granted the church to the archbishop and the diocese of Canterbury in )Tj
T*(1130, and William had a new church building constructed near Dover. The )Tj
T*(archbishop had planned to install canons regular into the church, and on )Tj
T*(William's deathbed dispatched a party of canons from Merton Priory to take over )Tj
T*(St Martin's. However, the party of canons, who had been accompanied by two )Tj
T*(bishops and some other clergy, were prevented from entering by a monk of )Tj
T*(Canterbury Cathedral, who claimed that St Martin's belonged to the monks of the )Tj
T*(cathedral chapter. The canons from Merton did not press the issue in the face )Tj
T*(of the Canterbury chapter's appeal to Rome, and after William's death, the )Tj
T*(cathedral chapter sent 12¬†monks to St Martin's instead.[1] )Tj
T*( The construction of the keep of Rochester Castle‚Äîat 115 feet \(35¬†m\), the )Tj
T*(tallest Norman-built keep in England‚Äîwas initiated at William's orders.[27] )Tj
T*(Built for King Henry, it is still intact, although it no longer has a roof or )Tj
T*(floors. The work at Rochester was built within the stone curtain walls that )Tj
T*(Gundulf of Rochester had erected in the late 11th¬†century. The keep was )Tj
T*(designed not only for defence but also to provide comfortable living quarters, )Tj
T*(which were probably intended for use by the archbishops when they visited )Tj
T*(Rochester.[28] In 1127, the custody of Rochester Castle was granted to William )Tj
T*(and his successors as archbishop by King Henry, including the right to fortify )Tj
T*(the place as the archbishops wished, and the right to garrison the castle with )Tj
T*(their own men.[29] In the view of the historian Judith Green, the grant of the )Tj
T*(castle was partly to secure the loyalty of the archbishop to the king, and )Tj
T*(partly to help secure the defences of the coast.[30] William also completed the )Tj
T*(construction of Canterbury Cathedral, which was dedicated in May 1130.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Final years )Tj
T*( The archbishop swore to Henry I that he would support Henry's daughter )Tj
T*(Matilda's claim to the English throne,[21] but after Henry's death he instead )Tj
T*(crowned Stephen, on 22¬†December 1135. He was persuaded to do so by Henry of )Tj
T*(Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Stephen's brother,[31][32] and Roger of )Tj
T*(Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. The bishops argued that Henry had no right to )Tj
T*(impose the oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and the )Tj
T*(bishops from the oath in any event. The royal steward, Hugh Bigod, swore that )Tj
T*(he had been present at the king's deathbed and had heard the king say that he )Tj
T*(released the oath.[33] )Tj
T*( William did not long outlive Henry, dying at Canterbury on 21¬†November )Tj
T*(1136.[14] He was buried in the north transept of Canterbury Cathedral.[1] )Tj
T*(Contemporaries were grudging in their praise, and William's reputation suffered )Tj
T*(after the accession of Matilda's son, Henry II, to the English throne. William )Tj
T*(of Malmesbury said that William was a courteous and sober man, with little of )Tj
T*(the flamboyant lifestyle of the more "modern" bishops. The author of the Gesta )Tj
T*(Stephani claimed that William was avaricious and hoarded money. None of the )Tj
T*(chroniclers, however, doubted his piety, even when they named him a perjurer )Tj
T*(and a traitor for his coronation of Stephen.[1] )Tj

T*(who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to )Tj
T*(replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited )Tj
T*(with changing the band's sound altogether, producing a notable shift in style )Tj
T*(from the music recorded with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated )Tj
T*(various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, but also contained )Tj
T*(more varied themes than previous outings, including lust, death, contemplations )Tj
T*(of suicide, California, drugs, globalization, and travel. )Tj
T*( Californication is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful studio )Tj
T*(release, with over 16¬†million copies sold worldwide,[1] and more than 5¬†million )Tj
T*(in the United States alone.[2] As of 2002, the album had sold over 4¬†million )Tj
T*(copies in Europe.[3] The record produced several hits for the band, including )Tj
T*("Otherside", "Californication" and the Grammy Award-winning "Scar Tissue". )Tj
T*(Californication peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. The record )Tj
T*(marked a significant change in style for the band: Rolling Stone's Greg Tate )Tj
T*(noted that "while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly )Tj
T*(spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic".[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( Guitarist John Frusciante left the band in the middle of a 1992 tour that )Tj
T*(promoted their critically acclaimed album Blood Sugar Sex Magik.[5] It took )Tj
T*(over a year for the band to find a new guitarist with whom to record )Tj
T*(officially. Dave Navarro, formerly of Jane's Addiction, was invited to join the )Tj
T*(Chili Peppers after Arik Marshall, who had finished the remaining tour dates )Tj
T*(for Blood Sugar Sex Magik, was fired.[6] Navarro influenced the band's ensuing )Tj
T*(album, One Hot Minute, by incorporating various elements of heavy metal and )Tj
T*(psychedelic rock,[7] which was something that the Chili Peppers had not )Tj
T*(previously been notable for. One Hot Minute was a commercial success, selling )Tj
T*(roughly five million copies \(although a let down compared to Blood Sugar Sex )Tj
T*(Magik\).[8] Critics, however, dismissed the album, claiming it was weak and )Tj
T*(unfocused.[7][9] Shortly after the release of One Hot Minute, Navarro was fired )Tj
T*(due to internal differences.[10] )Tj
T*( In the years following Frusciante's departure from the Chili Peppers, he had )Tj
T*(developed a vicious addiction to both heroin and cocaine that left him in )Tj
T*(poverty and near death.[11] Friends convinced him to enter drug rehabilitation )Tj
T*(in January 1998.[12] In April 1998, following Frusciante's three month )Tj
T*(completion, Flea visited his former band-mate and openly invited him to re-join )Tj
T*(the band, an invitation Frusciante readily accepted. Within the week, and for )Tj
T*(the first time in six years, the foursome gathered to play and jump-started the )Tj
T*(newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Writing and composition )Tj
T*( Much of the album was written in the band members' homes in the summer of )Tj
T*(1998. Kiedis and Frusciante often spent days together discussing song creation, )Tj
T*(guitar riffs and lyrical content. Bass and percussion aspects of the record )Tj
T*(were constructed through jam sessions and the individual work of Flea and )Tj
T*(Smith.[14] )Tj
T*( Californication's lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis' ideas, outlooks, )Tj
T*(and perceptions of life and its meaning. "Porcelain" resulted from Kiedis's )Tj
T*(meeting with a young mother at the YMCA, who was attempting to battle her )Tj
T*(alcohol addiction while living with her infant daughter.[15] Sarcasm was a )Tj
T*(concept that Kiedis had dealt with in the past, and he ultimately crafted a )Tj
T*(song around it. He was inspired by former band-mate Dave Navarro, whom he )Tj
T*(considered to be the "King of Sarcasm".[16] Frusciante approached the guitar )Tj
T*(line present in "Scar Tissue" as an attempt to use two notes that are played )Tj
T*(far apart, but produce a "cool rhythm".[17] He had explored this technique on )Tj
T*(his first solo album, 1994's Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt. )Tj
T*(Frusciante considers "Scar Tissue" to be a "very simple example of the )Tj
T*(technique, but I think it's a style that sounds like me". The guitarist made )Tj
T*(use of slide guitar-playing for the solos in the song.[17] The song Emit )Tj
T*(Remmus, which is summer time spelled backwards, was inspired by Anthony's brief )Tj
T*(relationship with Melanie C of the Spice Girls.[18] )Tj
T*( "Get On Top", a song which contains significant use of a wah pedal, was formed )Tj

T*(after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public )Tj
T*(Enemy: "I came up with [the rhythm to the song] on the way to rehearsal‚Äîjust )Tj
T*(tapping it out with my foot."[17] The understated guitar solo played in the )Tj
T*(middle of the song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to )Tj
T*(Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought )Tj
T*(process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' "Siberian Khatru": )Tj
T*("the band sounded really big‚Äîand they're playing really fast‚Äîand then this )Tj
T*(clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on )Tj
T*(its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that )Tj
T*(contrasted between the solo and the background."[17] "Savior", a song found )Tj
T*(towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an )Tj
T*(Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay.[17] Frusciante notes that )Tj
T*(the sound is "directly inspired by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. If you )Tj
T*(listen to the actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo‚Äîthey just don't sound )Tj
T*(like it because of the effects."[17] )Tj
T*( The hit "Around the World", which harkens back to the Chili Peppers' )Tj
T*(funk-influenced sound, was constructed by Frusciante at his home. The rhythm )Tj
T*(and beat, however, are intricate; this required him to play the song with the )Tj
T*(rest of the band rather than alone for them to understand it.[17] The bass lick )Tj
T*(was composed in "maybe 15 minutes," according to Frusciante: "Flea is the best )Tj
T*(bass player in the world. His sense of timing and the way he thinks is so )Tj
T*(crazy."[17] The title track of the album was among the most difficult for the )Tj
T*(band to complete. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar )Tj
T*(ensemble that would appropriately complement the poignant lyrical content, but )Tj
T*(encountered difficulty.[19] The song was barely making progress, and would have )Tj
T*(been scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. )Tj
T*(Frusciante completed the final riff two days before recording, after drawing )Tj
T*(inspiration from The Cure's soundtrack song to "Carnage Visors".[17][19] The )Tj
T*(title track was intended to represent Californian lifestyles and, more )Tj
T*(specifically, the "fake" nature which is associated with much of Hollywood. It )Tj
T*(references Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and uses considerable imagery to capture the )Tj
T*(evocative nature of California.[19] )Tj
T*( The record was a change of style for the Chili Peppers, especially compared to )Tj
T*(their previous album, One Hot Minute, which combined various elements of heavy )Tj
T*(metal and psychedelic rock. Although Californication still contains some funk )Tj
T*(rock songs \(such as "Around the World", "Get on Top", "I Like Dirt", "Purple )Tj
T*(Stain" and "Right on Time"\), it leaned towards more melodic riffs \(for example, )Tj
T*("Scar Tissue" and "Otherside"\) and focused on songs with implemented structure )Tj
T*(rather than jams.[20] )Tj
T*( [edit] Promotion and release )Tj
T*( Rick Rubin had produced their two previous albums. However, the Chili Peppers )Tj
T*(decided to look for other producers for Californication.[21]David Bowie had )Tj
T*(shown great interest in working with the band and asked to produce the album; )Tj
T*(however, the Chili Peppers chose to remain with Rubin for Californication.[21] )Tj
T*(Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their )Tj
T*(recording material; this was something they thought necessary for the album to )Tj
T*(be unique, and could only occur with his return.[22] Recording took place at )Tj
T*(Cello Studios in Los Angeles. In early 1999, following the recording process, )Tj
T*(the band played "Scar Tissue", "Otherside", and "Californication" to their )Tj
T*(managers, and it was decided that "Scar Tissue" would be the lead single for )Tj
T*(the album.[23] To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms )Tj
T*(across the country to promote Californication.[23] It sprouted a competition, )Tj
T*(which called upon high school students to write essays on "how they could make )Tj
T*(their schools better, safer, happier, more rocking places, so that they didn't )Tj
T*(have to go to school afraid. If you wrote the essay, you got a free ticket to )Tj
T*(the show."[23] )Tj
T*( Californication was released on June 8, 1999, debuting at #5 but peaking at #3 )Tj
T*(on the Billboard 200 chart. In Europe, the album peaked at #5 on the UK Top 40, )Tj
T*(#1 on the Finnish, Austrian, Swedish and New Zealand charts, and #2 on the )Tj
T*(French Top 40. It was certified gold just over a month later, on July 22, 1999, )Tj

T*(and its continuing sales have resulted in it being certified five-times )Tj
T*(platinum.[24][25] In March 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made )Tj
T*(available to purchase on the iTunes Music Store.[26] Albums bought there )Tj
T*(included new previously unreleased tracks \("Fat Dance", "Over Funk", and )Tj
T*("Quixoticelixer"\). In Germany, it was the band's best-selling album, staying on )Tj
T*(the Media Control Charts for 114 weeks \(more than 2 years\) and selling more )Tj
T*(than 750,000 copies, reaching 3√ó Gold.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical reception and legacy )Tj
T*( Californication received favorable reviews in contrast to its less popular )Tj
T*(predecessor, One Hot Minute, and it was a greater success worldwide.[28]Rolling )Tj
T*(Stone credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: "[his] vocal cords )Tj
T*(have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned )Tj
T*(with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic )Tj
T*(sensibility."[4] Songs such as "Otherside" and "Porcelain" were called )Tj
T*("Pumpkins-esque", while the album as a whole was "epiphanal" and the "RHCP )Tj
T*(furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty )Tj
T*(marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, )Tj
T*(binds communities and heals the sick."[4] Other critics credited the album's )Tj
T*(success to the return of Frusciante. Allmusic's Greg Prato said that the )Tj
T*("obvious reason for [the band's] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John )Tj
T*(Frusciante", considering him to be the "quintessential RHCP guitarist".[28] The )Tj
T*(album as a whole was "a bona fide Chili Peppers classic".[28]Entertainment )Tj
T*(Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a "more )Tj
T*(relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than )Tj
T*(ever before".[20] Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that "'This Velvet Glove' )Tj
T*(strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and )Tj
T*(anthemic rock," Woodlief continued "the disco intro to 'Parallel Universe' )Tj
T*(gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante's )Tj
T*(Hendrix-like excursions at the song's close."[34] )Tj
T*( While many critics found the band's new sound refreshing, NME criticized the )Tj
T*(Chili Peppers for rarely using their trademark funk sound, asking: "Can we have )Tj
T*(our brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this )Tj
T*(false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle."[35]Pitchfork, while )Tj
T*(considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication )Tj
T*(lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik.[32] It went on )Tj
T*(to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered )Tj
T*(Frusciante to be "the best big-time American rock guitarist going right )Tj
T*(now".[32] )Tj
T*( Over the years, Californication has maintained its popularity. "Scar Tissue" )Tj
T*(won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 2000.[36] The album was ranked )Tj
T*(number 399 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of )Tj
T*(All Time" and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for AOL )Tj
T*(Sessions that included "Scar Tissue" and "Californication".[37][38][39] The )Tj
T*(album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers; five of the sixteen )Tj
T*(songs on their Greatest Hits album were taken from Californication.[40] )Tj
T*( The album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of The Guardian called )Tj
T*("excessive compression and distortion" in the process of digital )Tj
T*(mastering.[41]Stylus Magazine labeled it as one of the victims of the loudness )Tj
T*(war and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that "even )Tj
T*(non-audiophile consumers complained about it".[42] An early, alternately )Tj
T*(mastered version of the album with a different track listing and mixing, )Tj
T*(probably a pre-release candidate, has been circulated on the internet.[43] )Tj
T*( [edit] Californication tour )Tj
T*( Immediately following the release of Californication, the band embarked on a )Tj
T*(world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate )Tj
T*(the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock '99, )Tj
T*(which became infamous for the resulting violence.[44][45] The band was informed )Tj
T*(minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out )Tj
T*(of control.[44] When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's )Tj
T*(song "Fire" to finish their set as a favor to Hendrix's sister, the disruption )Tj

T*(escalated into violence when several women, who had been crowd surfing and )Tj
T*(moshing, were raped and nearby property was looted and )Tj
T*(destroyed.[46][47][48][49] Kiedis felt that "It was clear that this situation )Tj
T*(had nothing to do with Woodstock any more. It wasn't symbolic of peace and )Tj
T*(love, but of greed and cashing in¬†... We woke up to papers and radio stations )Tj
T*(vilifying us for playing 'Fire'."[47] )Tj
T*( To kick off the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's )Tj
T*(Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000.[50] Kiedis recalled )Tj
T*(the situation: "Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we )Tj
T*(needed a police escort to get near the stage."[50] Following the European leg, )Tj
T*(the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ )Tj
T*(radio contest-winners, and then at the Big Day Out festival in Australia )Tj
T*(following several Japanese tour dates.[51] Flea, however, began to feel the )Tj
T*(repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less )Tj
T*(strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows )Tj
T*(would finish the remainder of the Californication tour.[52] As one of the last )Tj
T*(shows before the release of their next album By the Way, the Chili Peppers )Tj

T*( "Gender Bender"[nb 1] is the fourteenth episode of the first season of the )Tj
T*(American science fiction television series The X-Files. Premiering on the Fox )Tj
T*(network on January 21, 1994, it was written by Larry and Paul Barber, directed )Tj
T*(by Rob Bowman, and featured guest appearances by Brent Hinkley and Nicholas )Tj
T*(Lea. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, a stand-alone plot which is )Tj
T*(unconnected to the series' overarching mythology. )Tj
T*( The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder \(David Duchovny\) and Dana )Tj
T*(Scully \(Gillian Anderson\) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called )Tj
T*(X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully begin investigating a series of )Tj
T*(murders following sexual encounters. The two soon discover that a member of a )Tj
T*(religious sect living in Massachusetts may be responsible‚Äîand may not be human. )Tj
T*( The episode was inspired by producer Glen Morgan's desire for "an episode with )Tj
T*(more of a sexy edge"; however, the writers found it difficult to write a story )Tj
T*(that showed sex as scary. This difficulty led to the introduction of an )Tj
T*(Amish-like community as well. "Gender Bender" was seen by approximately 6.8¬†)Tj
T*(million households in its initial broadcast. The episode has subsequently been )Tj
T*(met with mixed critical responses, facing criticism for its abrupt deus ex )Tj
T*(machina ending. Academic analysis of the episode has placed it within a )Tj
T*(science-fiction tradition that attributes a powerful, supernatural element to )Tj
T*(physical contact with aliens. It has also been seen as reflecting anxieties )Tj
T*(about emerging gender roles in the 1990s. )Tj
T*( In a dance club, a young man is taken by a young woman, Marty \(Kate Twa\), for )Tj
T*(casual sex. The young man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves the room as a man )Tj
T*(\(Peter Stebbings\). FBI agents Fox Mulder \(David Duchovny\) and Dana Scully )Tj
T*(\(Gillian Anderson\) are called to the scene; Mulder believes that the man's )Tj
T*(death was caused by a fatal dose of pheromones. There is also ambiguity in )Tj
T*(similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence from the crime scene )Tj
T*(leads the duo to an Amish-type community in Massachusetts which Mulder calls )Tj
T*(the Kindred. )Tj
T*( Mulder approaches some of the Kindred, only to be shunned. Meanwhile, Scully )Tj
T*(befriends a member, Brother Andrew \(Brent Hinkley\), who is reluctant to talk. )Tj
T*(While shaking hands with him, Scully appears entranced, not coming to until )Tj
T*(Mulder catches her attention. The agents visit the Kindred's remote community, )Tj
T*(where they are asked to surrender their guns before entering. Mulder and Scully )Tj
T*(are invited to dinner. When the Kindred refuse to allow Scully to treat Brother )Tj
T*(Aaron, a sick participant at the table, Brother Andrew states that the Kindred )Tj
T*(take care of their own. Meanwhile, in another nightclub, a man convinces a girl )Tj
T*(to dance with him by touching her hand. )Tj
T*( When the Kindred escort the agents out of the village, Mulder comments on the )Tj
T*(lack of children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the )Tj
T*(same faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the )Tj
T*(village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to )Tj
T*(a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims to be able to give her )Tj
T*(information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the )Tj
T*(barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder )Tj
T*(hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive )Tj
T*(and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his )Tj
T*(power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and eventually needs to be )Tj
T*(rescued by Mulder. The agents are again escorted out of the village. )Tj

T*(Michael suddenly starts retching, the officer is attacked by Brother Martin, )Tj
T*(who changes into a man and escapes. In the hospital Michael reluctantly reveals )Tj
T*(to Mulder and Scully that when he looked out of the car, the girl he was with )Tj
T*("looked like a man". The agents are then alerted about activity on a previous )Tj
T*(victim's credit card, which was stolen by Brother Martin. The agents chase )Tj
T*(Brother Martin into an alley, only to have the Kindred appear and take him )Tj
T*(away. That night the agents rush back to the village which now bears a deserted )Tj
T*(look. The underground tunnels are blocked entirely with the white clay. Mulder )Tj
T*(and Scully walk into the nearby field where they find a large crop circle, )Tj
T*(suggesting that the Kindred are aliens. )Tj
T*( [edit] Production )Tj
T*( While discussing the installment's origins, producer Glen Morgan said that he )Tj
T*("wanted an episode with more of a sexy edge". It proved difficult to portray )Tj
T*(sex as convincingly scary, which caused the producers to introduce the concept )Tj
T*(of "people like the Amish who are from another planet". "Gender Bender" was )Tj
T*(penned by freelance writers Larry and Paul Barber, whose initial draft focused )Tj
T*(heavily on the contrast between the farming community of the Kindred and a )Tj
T*(version of city life "with very sexual connotations", influenced by the works )Tj
T*(of Swiss artist H. R. Giger. This script went through various rewrites during )Tj
T*(the development process, including the removal of a scene where someone's )Tj
T*(crotch rots away, to address concerns about the content of the episode. The )Tj
T*(chants uttered by the Kindred were not in the script handed in by the Barbers; )Tj
T*(they were added later by producer Paul Rabwin. )Tj
T*( The character of Marty was portrayed by two actors‚ÄîKate Twa plays its female )Tj
T*(form and Peter Stebbings the male. Twa was the first of the two to be cast, )Tj
T*(leading producer R. W. Goodwin to base the casting of Stebbings mostly on his )Tj
T*("very strong resemblance" to the actress. This resemblance was exploited in a )Tj
T*(scene showing Twa morphing into Stebbings; however, Goodwin felt that the two )Tj
T*(actors were too similar for the effect to be readily apparent, "zapp[ing] the )Tj
T*(energy out of the moment". Nicholas Lea, who played a would-be victim in the )Tj
T*(episode, would return to the series in a recurring role as Alex Krycek, )Tj
T*(beginning with the second season's "Sleepless". Twa would also return that )Tj
T*(season, playing a former colleague of Scully in "Soft Light". )Tj
T*( "Gender Bender" marked Rob Bowman's directorial debut on the series; he would )Tj
T*(become one of the series' most prolific directors, even directing the 1998 film )Tj
T*(adaptation, The X-Files: Fight the Future.[13] Bowman found "Gender Bender" a )Tj
T*(difficult episode to work on‚Äîthe script had initially called for lantern light )Tj
T*(to illuminate several scenes, but this was found to be unworkable. In addition, )Tj
T*(an interior set constructed to represent the catacombs under the Kindred's barn )Tj
T*(was so encumbering to film in that a second unit crew were required to reshoot )Tj
T*(a large degree of camera coverage. This need for extra footage necessitated an )Tj
T*(additional day of filming for scenes featuring Duchovny. )Tj
T*( The exterior shots of the village inhabited by the Kindred were filmed at a )Tj
T*(historic farm preserved from the 1890s in Langley, British Columbia, while )Tj
T*(interior sets were simply built on a sound stage. The small town visited by the )Tj
T*(agents was filmed on location in Steveston, British Columbia‚Äîa location which )Tj
T*(would be revisited to film the first-season episode "Miracle Man". The music )Tj
T*(used in the episode's nightclub scenes was recycled from composer Mark Snow's )Tj
T*(earlier work on the television film In the Line of Duty: Street War. )Tj
T*( [edit] Themes )Tj
T*( "Gender Bender" has been interpreted as representing contemporary sexual )Tj
T*(anxieties in a figurative manner, conflating seduction with alien abduction. M. )Tj
T*(Keith Booker has described the Kindred's shapeshifting as representative of )Tj
T*(contemporary sexual anxieties caused by the changing gender roles of the )Tj
T*(decade, coupled with "a basic fear of sexual contact". Antonio Ballesteros )Tj
T*(Gonz√°lez has stated that the episode is representative of the series' )Tj
T*(exploration of both seduction and abduction, noting that "both are seen as part )Tj
T*(of sexual aggression", further describing the episode's villain as representing )Tj
T*("the fear of sex and reproduction". The lethal nature of the Kindred's touch )Tj

T*(E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, and the novel The Puppet Masters. )Tj
T*( [edit] Broadcast and reception )Tj
T*( "Gender Bender" originally aired on Fox on January 21, 1994, and was first )Tj
T*(broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on December 22, 1994.[22] The )Tj
T*(episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.2, with a 12¬†share. It was )Tj
T*(viewed by 6.8 million households and 11.1 million viewers, meaning that roughly )Tj
T*(7.2 percent of all television-equipped households, and 12 percent of households )Tj
T*(watching television, were tuned in to the episode.[24] )Tj
T*( The episode faced criticism from the crew over its ending using a deus ex )Tj
T*(machina to indicate that the Kindred may have been aliens. Producer James Wong )Tj
T*(felt that the episode's ending seemed overly abrupt and unexpected, describing )Tj
T*(it as appearing "like we tried to play a trick on the audience to make them say )Tj
T*('Ooh, what the heck was that?'". He added that the lack of a real connection to )Tj
T*(the episode's plot meant that the revelation lost any sense of catharsis for )Tj
T*(the viewer. Morgan said that the episode "went too far. At what point do we )Tj
T*(become unbelievable?" In addition, when asked about the similarity between the )Tj
T*(Kindred and the Amish, series creator Chris Carter noted that "they [the Amish] )Tj
T*(don't watch TV, so I wasn't worried about it". )Tj
T*( "Gender Bender" received generally positive to mixed reviews from critics. In )Tj
T*(a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, "Gender Bender" )Tj
T*(was rated "B‚àí", being described as a "clever idea" that was "undermined by a )Tj
T*(bushel of burning questions".[25] Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, )Tj
T*(praised the episode, rating it an "A". He felt that the plot was "a perfect )Tj
T*(mixture of scientific theory, unsubstantiated rumor, and memorable )Tj
T*(visuals".[26] Handlen felt that the episode effectively represented the ideal )Tj
T*(plot for The X-Files, featuring someone briefly interacting with supernatural )Tj
T*(phenomena without ever learning the truth of their experience.[26] Matt Haigh, )Tj
T*(writing for Den of Geek, reviewed "Gender Bender" positively, feeling that it )Tj
T*(was "a nicely refreshing and original idea", with "strikingly atmospheric" sets )Tj
T*(and "impressively spooky" villains.[27] )Tj
T*( Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical )Tj
T*(Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen, rated "Gender Bender" )Tj
T*(one-and-half stars out of five, finding that it "finishes up¬†... entirely )Tj
T*(clich√©d". Shearman felt that Bowman's direction, and the contrast between )Tj
T*("decadent" night-life and the "restraint and denial" of the Kindred, were )Tj
T*(highlights of the episode. However, he also felt that it approached its themes )Tj
T*(too conservatively and tamely, leaving a "boring" end result. In his book The )Tj
T*(Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes, author Phil Farrand has highlighted several )Tj
T*(inconsistencies in the episode, focusing on the implausible nature of the )Tj
T*(ending. Farrand cites the mention of the Kindred's pheromones containing human )Tj
T*(DNA and their use of the English language when in private as elements which )Tj
T*(seem incongruous for an alien race.[29] )Tj

T*( Huntington's disease \(HD\) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects )Tj
T*(muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and psychiatric problems. It )Tj
T*(typically becomes noticeable in mid-adult life. HD is the most common genetic )Tj
T*(cause of abnormal involuntary writhing movements called chorea, which is why )Tj
T*(the disease used to be called Huntington's chorea. )Tj
T*( It is much more common in people of Western European descent than in those of )Tj
T*(Asian or African ancestry. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant )Tj
T*(mutation in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin, )Tj
T*(which means any child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of )Tj
T*(inheriting the disease. Physical symptoms of Huntington's disease can begin at )Tj
T*(any age from infancy to old age, but usually begin between 35 and 44 years of )Tj
T*(age. Through genetic anticipation, the disease may develop earlier in life in )Tj
T*(each successive generation. About 6% of cases start before the age of 21 years )Tj
T*(with an akinetic-rigid syndrome; they progress faster and vary slightly. The )Tj
T*(variant is classified as juvenile, akinetic-rigid or Westphal variant HD. )Tj
T*( The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is )Tj
T*(also called "huntingtin". Expansion of a CAG triplet repeat stretch within the )Tj
T*(Huntingtin gene results in a different \(mutant\) form of the protein, which )Tj
T*(gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully )Tj
T*(understood. The genetic basis of HD was discovered in 1993 by an international )Tj
T*(collaborative effort spearheaded by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. )Tj

T*(individuals considering genetic testing and has become a model for other )Tj
T*(genetically dominant diseases. )Tj
T*( Symptoms of the disease can vary between individuals and even among affected )Tj
T*(members of the same family, but usually progress predictably. The earliest )Tj
T*(symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or cognition. A general lack of )Tj

T*(uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent, along with a decline )Tj
T*(in mental abilities and behavioral and psychiatric problems. Physical abilities )Tj
T*(are gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult. Mental )Tj
T*(abilities generally decline into dementia. Complications such as pneumonia, )Tj
T*(heart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy to around )Tj
T*(twenty years after symptoms begin. There is no cure for HD, and full-time care )Tj

T*( [edit] Signs and symptoms )Tj
T*( Symptoms of Huntington's disease commonly become noticeable between the ages )Tj
T*(of 35 and 44¬†years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old )Tj
T*(age.[1][2] In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, )Tj
T*(cognition, and physical skills.[1] The physical symptoms are usually the first )Tj
T*(to be noticed, as cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are generally not severe )Tj
T*(enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages.[1] Almost everyone )Tj
T*(with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but )Tj
T*(the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and psychiatric symptoms vary )Tj
T*(significantly between individuals.[3][4] )Tj
T*( The most characteristic initial physical symptoms are jerky, random, and )Tj
T*(uncontrollable movements called chorea.[1] Chorea may be initially exhibited as )Tj
T*(general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, )Tj
T*(lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements.[1] These minor motor )Tj
T*(abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction by at )Tj
T*(least three years.[3] The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, )Tj
T*(writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses.[5] )Tj
T*(These are signs that the system in the brain that is responsible for movement )Tj
T*(has been affected.[6]Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such )Tj
T*(that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences )Tj
T*(are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, )Tj
T*(swallowing and speaking.[5] Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and )Tj
T*(may lead to malnutrition.[7][8]Sleep disturbances are also associated )Tj
T*(symptoms.[9] Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally )Tj
T*(progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity )Tj
T*(being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of )Tj
T*(HD.[5] )Tj

T*(Htt\), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the )Tj
T*(brain have differing amounts and reliance on these type of neurons, and are )Tj
T*(affected accordingly.[5] Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how )Tj
T*(much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of )Tj
T*(the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to )Tj
T*(environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD.[13] 36‚Äì39 repeats )Tj
T*(result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and )Tj
T*(slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that )Tj
T*(symptoms are never noticed.[15] With very large repeat counts, HD has full )Tj

T*(juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% )Tj
T*(of HD carriers.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Inheritance )Tj
T*( Huntington's disease has autosomal dominant inheritance, meaning that an )Tj
T*(affected individual typically inherits one copy of the gene with an expanded )Tj
T*(trinucleotide repeat \(the mutant allele\) from an affected parent.[1] Since )Tj
T*(penetrance of the mutation is very high, those who have a mutated copy of the )Tj
T*(gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring )Tj
T*(of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and )Tj
T*(therefore being affected with the disorder \(see figure\). This probability is )Tj
T*(sex-independent.[17] )Tj
T*( Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are unstable during replication and this )Tj
T*(instability increases with the number of repeats present.[15] This usually )Tj
T*(leads to new expansions as generations pass \(dynamic mutations\) instead of )Tj
T*(reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat.[13] This causes the )Tj
T*(number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected )Tj
T*(parent with an "intermediate" number of repeats \(28‚Äì35\), or "reduced )Tj
T*(penetrance" \(36‚Äì40\), may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the )Tj
T*(number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD.[13] Such increases in the )Tj
T*(number of repeats \(and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease\) in )Tj

T*(has since been found that it can affect the phenotype and the rate of )Tj

T*( [edit] Mechanism )Tj
T*( The Htt protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, and appears to have )Tj
T*(multiple biological functions.[22] The behavior of this mutated protein is not )Tj
T*(completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in )Tj
T*(the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease )Tj
T*(progresses, other areas of the brain are also more conspicuously affected. )Tj
T*(Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical )Tj
T*(connections - namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive )Tj
T*(function.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Htt function )Tj
T*( Htt is expressed in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations are found )Tj
T*(in the brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and )Tj
T*(lungs.[12] The function of Htt in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins )Tj
T*(which are involved in transcription, cell signaling and intracellular )Tj
T*(transporting.[12][23] In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several )Tj
T*(functions of Htt have been found.[24] In these animals, Htt is important for )Tj
T*(embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. It also )Tj
T*(acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls )Tj
T*(the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects )Tj
T*(neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. Htt also facilitates )Tj
T*(vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene )Tj
T*(transcription.[24] If the expression of Htt is increased and more Htt produced, )Tj
T*(brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHtt are reduced, whereas )Tj
T*(when the expression of Htt is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more )Tj
T*(typical of the presence of mHtt.[24] In humans the disruption of the normal )Tj
T*(gene does not cause the disease.[12] It is thought that the disease is not )Tj
T*(caused by inadequate production of Htt, but by a gain of toxic function of )Tj
T*(mHtt.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cellular changes due to mHtt )Tj
T*( There are multiple cellular changes through which the toxic function of mHtt )Tj
T*(may manifest and produce the HD pathology.[25][26] During the biological )Tj
T*(process of posttranslational modification of mHtt, cleavage of the protein can )Tj
T*(leave behind shorter fragments constituted of parts of the polyglutamine )Tj
T*(expansion.[25] The polar nature of glutamine causes interactions with other )Tj
T*(proteins when it is overabundant in Htt proteins. Thus, the mHtt molecule )Tj
T*(strands will form hydrogen bonds with one another, forming a protein aggregate )Tj
T*(rather than folding into functional proteins.[27] Over time, the aggregates )Tj
T*(accumulate, ultimately interfering with neuron function because these fragments )Tj
T*(can then misfold and coalesce, in a process called protein aggregation, to form )Tj
T*(inclusion bodies within cells.[25][27] Neuronal inclusions run indirect )Tj
T*(interference. The excess protein aggregates clump together at axons and )Tj
T*(dendrites in neurons which mechanically stops the transmission of )Tj
T*(neurotransmitters because vesicles \(filled with neurotransmitters\) can no )Tj

T*( HD affects the whole brain, but certain areas are more vulnerable than others. )Tj
T*(The most prominent early effects are in a part of the basal ganglia called the )Tj

T*(areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral )Tj
T*(cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal )Tj
T*(nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus.[13] These areas are )Tj
T*(affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, )Tj
T*(reducing in size as they lose cells.[13] Striatal spiny neurons are the most )Tj
T*(vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus )Tj
T*(pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum )Tj
T*(being less affected.[13][31] HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes )Tj
T*(and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.[32] )Tj
T*( The basal ganglia‚Äîthe part of the brain most prominently affected in early )Tj
T*(HD‚Äîplay a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not )Tj
T*(fully understood, but current theories propose that they are part of the )Tj
T*(cognitive executive system[6] and the motor circuit.[33] The basal ganglia )Tj
T*(ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. )Tj
T*(To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the )Tj
T*(basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal )Tj
T*(ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic )Tj
T*(and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be )Tj
T*(unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its )Tj
T*(intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the )Tj
T*(characteristic erratic movements associated with HD.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Transcriptional dysregulation )Tj
T*( CREB-binding protein \(CBP\), a transcription factor, is essential for cell )Tj
T*(function because as a coactivator at a significant number of promoters, it )Tj
T*(activates the transcription of genes for survival pathways.[30] Furthermore, )Tj

T*(glutamines on CBP interact directly with the increased numbers of glutamine on )Tj
T*(the Htt chain and CBP gets pulled away from its typical location next to the )Tj
T*(nucleus.[34] Specifically, CRB contains an acetyltransferase domain that, in an )Tj

T*(HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to )Tj

T*(years using genealogical studies.[61] Genetic haplotypes can also give clues )Tj
T*(for the geographic variations of prevalence.[61][66] )Tj
T*( Until the discovery of a genetic test, statistics could only include clinical )Tj
T*(diagnosis based on physical symptoms and a family history of HD, excluding )Tj
T*(those who died of other causes before diagnosis. These cases can now be )Tj
T*(included in statistics and as the test becomes more widely available, estimates )Tj
T*(of the prevalence and incidence of the disorder are likely to increase.[61][67] )Tj
T*(Indeed, in 2010 evidence emerged from the UK that the prevalence of HD may be )Tj
T*(as much as twice that previously estimated.[68] )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( Although Huntington's has been recognized as a disorder since at least the )Tj
T*(Middle Ages, the cause has been unknown until fairly recently. Huntington's was )Tj
T*(given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease )Tj
T*(changed. Originally called simply 'chorea' for the jerky dancelike movements )Tj
T*(associated with the disease, HD has also been called "hereditary chorea" and )Tj
T*("chronic progressive chorea".[70] The first definite mention of HD was in a )Tj
T*(letter by Charles Oscar Waters, published in the first edition of Robley )Tj
T*(Dunglison's Practice of Medicine in 1842. Waters described "a form of chorea, )Tj
T*(vulgarly called magrums", including accurate descriptions of the chorea, its )Tj
T*(progression, and the strong heredity of the disease.[71] In 1846 Charles Gorman )Tj
T*(observed how higher prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions.[71] )Tj
T*(Independently of Gorman and Waters, both students of Dunglison at Jefferson )Tj
T*(Medical College in Philadelphia,[72]Johan Christian Lund also produced an early )Tj
T*(description in 1860.[71] He specifically noted that in Setesdalen, a secluded )Tj
T*(mountain valley in Norway, there was a high prevalence of dementia associated )Tj
T*(with a pattern of jerking movement disorders that ran in families.[73] )Tj
T*( The first thorough description of the disease was by George Huntington in )Tj
T*(1872. Examining the combined medical history of several generations of a family )Tj
T*(exhibiting similar symptoms, he realized their conditions must be linked; he )Tj
T*(presented his detailed and accurate definition of the disease as his first )Tj
T*(paper. Huntington described the exact pattern of inheritance of autosomal )Tj
T*(dominant disease years before the rediscovery by scientists of Mendelian )Tj
T*(inheritance. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*("Of its hereditary nature. When either or both the parents have shown )Tj
T*(manifestations of the disease¬†..., one or more of the offspring almost )Tj
T*(invariably suffer from the disease¬†... But if by any chance these children go )Tj
T*(through life without it, the thread is broken and the grandchildren and )Tj
T*(great-grandchildren of the original shakers may rest assured that they are free )Tj
T*(from the disease.".[69][74])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Sir William Osler was interested in the disorder and chorea in general, and )Tj
T*(was impressed with Huntington's paper, stating that "In the history of )Tj
T*(medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, )Tj
T*(more graphically or more briefly described."[71][75] Osler's continued interest )Tj
T*(in HD, combined with his influence in the field of medicine, helped to rapidly )Tj
T*(spread awareness and knowledge of the disorder throughout the medical )Tj
T*(community.[71] Great interest was shown by scientists in Europe, including )Tj
T*(Louis Th√©ophile Joseph Landouzy, D√©sir√©-Magloire Bourneville, Camillo Golgi, )Tj
T*(and Joseph Jules Dejerine, and until the end of the century, much of the )Tj
T*(research into HD was European in origin.[71] By the end of the 19th century, )Tj
T*(research and reports on HD had been published in many countries and the disease )Tj
T*(was recognized as a worldwide condition.[71] )Tj

T*(inheritance.[71] The English biologist William Bateson used the pedigrees of )Tj
T*(affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance )Tj
T*(pattern.[72] The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers, )Tj
T*(including Smith Ely Jelliffe, to attempt to trace and connect family members of )Tj
T*(previous studies.[71] Jelliffe collected information from across New York State )Tj
T*(and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in New )Tj
T*(England.[76] Jelliffe's research roused the interest of his college friend, )Tj
T*(Charles Davenport, who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field )Tj
T*(study on the East Coast of the United States of families with HD and to )Tj
T*(construct their pedigrees.[77] Davenport used this information to document the )Tj
T*(variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD; he claimed that most cases )Tj
T*(of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals.[77] This )Tj
T*(research was further embellished in 1932 by P. R. Vessie, who popularized the )Tj
T*(idea that three brothers who left England in 1630 bound for Boston were the )Tj
T*(progenitors of HD in the USA.[78] The claim that the earliest progenators had )Tj
T*(been established and eugenic bias of Muncey's, Davenport, and Vessie's work )Tj
T*(contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD.[72] Muncey and )Tj
T*(Davenport also popularized the idea that in the past some HD sufferers may have )Tj
T*(been thought to be possessed by spirits or victims of witchcraft, and were )Tj
T*(sometimes shunned or exiled by society.[79][80] This idea has not been proven. )Tj
T*(Researchers have found contrary evidence; for instance, the community of the )Tj
T*(family studied by George Huntington openly accommodated those who exhibited )Tj
T*(symptoms of HD.[72][79] )Tj
T*( The search for the cause of this condition was enhanced considerably in 1968 )Tj
T*(when the Hereditary Disease Foundation \(HDF\) was created by Milton Wexler, a )Tj
T*(psychoanalyst based in Los Angeles, California whose wife Leonore Sabin had )Tj
T*(been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntingdon's disease.[81] The three )Tj
T*(brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was )Tj
T*(involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the Huntington's Disease )Tj
T*(Collaborative Research Project who over a 10 year period worked to locate the )Tj
T*(responsible gene. )Tj
T*( Thanks to the HDF, the ongoing US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative )Tj
T*(Research Project was started in 1979, and reported a major breakthrough in 1983 )Tj
T*(with the discovery of the approximate location of a causal gene.[65] This was )Tj
T*(the result of an extensive study focusing on the populations of two isolated )Tj
T*(Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually )Tj
T*(high prevalence of the disease. It involved over 18,000 people - mostly from a )Tj
T*(single extended family. )Tj
T*( Among other innovations, the project developed DNA-marking methods which were )Tj
T*(an important step in making the Human Genome Project possible.[82] In 1993, the )Tj
T*(research group isolated the precise causal gene at 4p16.3,[83] making this the )Tj
T*(first autosomal disease locus found using genetic linkage analysis.[83][84] )Tj
T*( In the same time frame, key discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the )Tj
T*(disorder were being made, including the findings by Anita Harding's research )Tj
T*(group on the effects of the gene's length.[85] )Tj
T*( Modelling the disease in various types of animals, such as the transgenic )Tj
T*(mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments. As these animals )Tj
T*(have faster metabolisms and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from )Tj
T*(experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that )Tj
T*(mHtt fragments misfold led to the discovery of the nuclear inclusions they )Tj
T*(cause. These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the )Tj
T*(proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, )Tj
T*(and the gene itself.[71][86] )Tj
T*( The condition was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea', but this term has )Tj
T*(been replaced by 'Huntington's disease', because not all patients develop )Tj
T*(chorea, and because of the importance of cognitive and behavioral problems.[87] )Tj

T*(eugenics movement.[88]In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use )Tj
T*(of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal )Tj
T*(testing and embryonic stem cells.[89][90] )Tj
T*( The development of an accurate diagnostic test for Huntington's disease has )Tj
T*(caused social, legal, and ethical concerns over access to and use of a person's )Tj
T*(results.[91][92] Many guidelines and testing procedures have strict procedures )Tj
T*(for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals to decide when and how )Tj
T*(to receive their results and also to whom the results are made )Tj
T*(available.[12]Financial institutions and businesses are faced with the question )Tj
T*(of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as )Tj
T*(for life insurance or employment. Although the United Kingdom's insurance )Tj
T*(companies have agreed that until 2014 they will not use genetic information )Tj
T*(when writing most insurance policies,[93] Huntington's is explicitly excluded )Tj
T*(from this agreement.[94] As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a )Tj
T*(later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on )Tj
T*(a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that )Tj
T*(individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered )Tj
T*(cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a )Tj
T*(right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an )Tj
T*(effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be )Tj
T*(competent is considered unethical in most cases.[26][95][96] )Tj
T*( There are ethical concerns related to prenatal genetic testing or )Tj
T*(preimplantation genetic diagnosis to ensure a child is not born with a given )Tj
T*(disease.[97] For example, prenatal testing raises the issue of selective )Tj
T*(abortion, a choice considered unacceptable by some.[97] As it is a dominant )Tj
T*(disease, there are difficulties in situations in which a parent does not want )Tj
T*(to know his or her own diagnosis. This would require parts of the process to be )Tj
T*(kept secret from the parent.[97] )Tj
T*( [edit] Support organizations )Tj
T*( In 1968, after experiencing HD in his wife's family, Dr. Milton Wexler was )Tj
T*(inspired to start the Hereditary Disease Foundation \(HDF\), with the aim of )Tj
T*(curing genetic illnesses by coordinating and supporting research.[98] The )Tj
T*(foundation and Dr. Wexler's daughter, Nancy Wexler, were key parts of the )Tj
T*(research team in Venezuela which discovered the HD gene.[98] )Tj
T*( At roughly the same time as the HDF formed, Marjorie Guthrie helped to found )Tj
T*(the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease \(now the Huntington's Disease )Tj
T*(Society of America\), after her husband Woody Guthrie died from complications of )Tj
T*(HD.[99] )Tj
T*( Since then, support and research organizations have formed in many countries )Tj
T*(around the world and have helped to increase public awareness of HD. A number )Tj
T*(of these collaborate in umbrella organizations, like the International )Tj
T*(Huntington Association and the European HD network.[100] Many support )Tj
T*(organizations hold an annual HD awareness event, some of which have been )Tj
T*(endorsed by their respective governments. For example, June 6 is designated )Tj
T*("National Huntington's Disease Awareness Day" by the US Senate.[101] )Tj
T*( The largest funder of Huntington's disease research globally, in terms of )Tj
T*(financial expenditure,[102] is the CHDI Foundation, a US non-profit biomedical )Tj
T*(foundation that aims to "rapidly discover and develop drugs that delay or slow )Tj
T*(Huntington's disease".[103] CHDI was formerly known as the High Q Foundation. )Tj
T*(In 2006, it spent $50 million on Huntington's disease research.[102] CHDI )Tj

T*( [edit] Research directions )Tj
T*( Research into the mechanism of HD has focused on identifying the functioning )Tj
T*(of Htt, how mHtt differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that )Tj
T*(the disease produces. Research is conducted using in vitro methods, animal )Tj
T*(models and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the )Tj
T*(fundamental mechanisms causing the disease and for supporting the early stages )Tj
T*(of drug development.[86] Animals with chemically induced brain injury exhibit )Tj
T*(HD-like symptoms and were initially used, but they did not mimic the )Tj
T*(progressive features of the disease.[105] The identification of the causative )Tj
T*(gene has enabled the development of many transgenic animal models including )Tj
T*(nematode worms, Drosophila fruit flies, mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys )Tj
T*(that express mutant huntingtin and develop progressive neurodegeneration and )Tj
T*(HD-like symptoms.[86] )Tj
T*( Three broad approaches are under study to attempt to slow the progression of )Tj
T*(Huntington's disease: reducing production of the mutant protein, improving )Tj
T*(cells' ability to survive its diverse harmful effects, and replacing lost )Tj
T*(neurons.[106] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reducing huntingtin production )Tj
T*( Gene silencing aims to reduce the production of the mutant protein, since HD )Tj
T*(is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing )Tj
T*(experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHtt is )Tj
T*(reduced, symptoms improve.[106] Safety of gene silencing has now been )Tj
T*(demonstrated in the large, human-like brains of primates.[107] )Tj
T*( [edit] Improving cell survival )Tj
T*( Among the approaches aimed at improving cell survival in the presence of )Tj
T*(mutant huntingtin are correction of transcriptional regulation using histone )Tj
T*(deacetylase inhibitors, modulating aggregation of huntingtin, improving )Tj
T*(metabolism and mitochondrial function and restoring dysfunction of )Tj
T*(synapses.[106] )Tj
T*( [edit] Neuronal replacement )Tj
T*( Stem cell therapy is the replacement of damaged neurons by transplantation of )Tj
T*(stem cells into affected regions of the brain. Experiments have yielded mixed )Tj
T*(results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human clinical )Tj
T*(trials.[108] Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are )Tj
T*(already a valuable tool for studying HD in the laboratory.[109] )Tj
T*( [edit] Clinical trials )Tj
T*( Numerous drugs have been reported to produce benefits in animals, including )Tj
T*(creatine, coenzyme Q10 and the antibiotic minocycline. Some of these have then )Tj
T*(been tested by humans in clinical trials, with more underway, but as yet none )Tj
T*(has proven effective.[51] In 2010, minocycline was found to be ineffective for )Tj
T*(humans in a multi-center trial.[110] Large observational studies involving )Tj
T*(human volunteers have revealed insights into the pathobiology of HD and )Tj
T*(supplied outcome measures for future clinical trials.[111] )Tj

T*( The Dodo \(Raphus cucullatus\) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to )Tj
T*(the island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Its closest )Tj
T*(genetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues Solitaire, the two forming the )Tj
T*(subfamily Raphinae of the family of pigeons and doves. The closest living )Tj
T*(relative of the Dodo is the Nicobar Pigeon. A white Dodo was once incorrectly )Tj
T*(thought to have existed on the nearby island of R√©union. )Tj
T*( The Dodo's external appearance is evidenced only by paintings and written )Tj
T*(accounts from the 17th century. Because these vary considerably, and because )Tj
T*(only a few sketches are known to have been drawn from live specimens, its exact )Tj
T*(appearance in life remains a mystery. Similarly, little is known with certainty )Tj
T*(about its habitat and behaviour. Subfossil remains show the Dodo was about one )Tj
T*(metre \(3.3¬†ft\) tall and may have weighed 10‚Äì18¬†kg \(22‚Äì40¬†lb\) in the wild. It )Tj
T*(has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage, yellow feet, a tuft of tail )Tj
T*(feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used )Tj
T*(gizzard stones to help digest its food, which is thought to have included )Tj
T*(fruits, and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier )Tj
T*(coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its clutch consisted of a single )Tj
T*(egg. It is presumed that the Dodo became flightless because of the ready )Tj
T*(availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on )Tj
T*(Mauritius. )Tj
T*( The first recorded mention of the Dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the )Tj
T*(following years, the bird was preyed upon by hungry sailors, their domesticated )Tj
T*(animals, and invasive species introduced during that time. The last widely )Tj
T*(accepted sighting of a Dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately )Tj
T*(noticed, and some considered it to be a mythical creature. In the 19th century, )Tj
T*(research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that )Tj
T*(had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century. Since then, a large )Tj
T*(amount of subfossil material has been collected from Mauritius, mostly from the )Tj
T*(Mare aux Songes swamp. The extinction of the Dodo within only about a century )Tj
T*(of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of )Tj
T*(human involvement in the disappearance of entire species. The Dodo achieved )Tj
T*(widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alice in Wonderland, and )Tj
T*(it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a symbol of )Tj
T*(extinction and obsolescence. It is frequently used as a mascot on Mauritius. )Tj
T*( Taxonomy )Tj
T*( The Dodo has been variously declared a small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, )Tj
T*(and a vulture. In 1842, Johannes Theodor Reinhardt proposed that Dodos were )Tj
T*(ground pigeons, based on studies of a Dodo skull he had discovered in the royal )Tj
T*(Danish collection at Copenhagen. This view was met with ridicule, but was later )Tj
T*(supported by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville in their 1848 )Tj
T*(monograph The Dodo and Its Kindred, which attempted to separate myth from )Tj
T*(reality. After dissecting the preserved head and foot of the specimen at the )Tj
T*(Oxford University Museum and comparing it with the few remains then available )Tj
T*(of the extinct Rodrigues Solitaire \(Pezophaps solitaria\) they found that the )Tj
T*(two were closely related. Strickland stated that although not identical, these )Tj
T*(birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones, otherwise known )Tj

T*(only in pigeons.[10] )Tj
T*( The Dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. Strickland )Tj
T*(pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, )Tj
T*(slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, )Tj
T*(almost reaching their beak, as in Dodos. The forehead was high in relation to )Tj
T*(the beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and )Tj
T*(surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The )Tj
T*(legs of the Dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons )Tj
T*(than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. )Tj
T*(Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which )Tj
T*(this feature is more developed than other birds. Pigeons generally have very )Tj
T*(small clutches, and the Dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, )Tj
T*(the Dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in )Tj
T*(the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate and the hallux. The Dodo differed )Tj
T*(from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of )Tj
T*(the beak in proportion to the rest of the cranium.[10] )Tj
T*( Throughout the 19th century, several species were classified as congeneric )Tj
T*(with the Dodo, including the Rodrigues Solitaire and the R√©union Solitaire, as )Tj
T*(Didus solitarius and Raphus solitarius, respectively \(Didus and Raphus being )Tj
T*(names for the Dodo genus used by different authors of the time\). An atypical )Tj
T*(17th-century description of a Dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to )Tj
T*(have belonged to the Rodrigues Solitaire, led Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a )Tj
T*(new species, Didus nazarenus, in 1852. Based on Solitaire remains, it is now a )Tj
T*(synonym of that species. Crude drawings of the Red Rail of Mauritius were also )Tj
T*(misinterpreted as Dodo species, Didus broeckii and Didus herberti. )Tj
T*( Evolution )Tj
T*( For many years the Dodo and the Rodrigues Solitaire were placed in a family of )Tj
T*(their own, the Raphidae \(formerly Dididae\), because their exact relationships )Tj
T*(with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was placed in its own monotypic family )Tj
T*(\(Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively\), as it was thought that they had )Tj
T*(evolved their similar features independently.Osteological and molecular data )Tj
T*(has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the Dodo and )Tj
T*(Solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, in the family )Tj
T*(Columbidae. )Tj
T*( Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome b and 12S rRNA sequences isolated from )Tj
T*(a Dodo tarsal and a Rodrigues Solitaire femur confirmed their close )Tj
T*(relationship and their placement within the Columbidae. The genetic evidence )Tj
T*(was interpreted as showing the Southeast Asian Nicobar Pigeon to be their )Tj
T*(closest living relative, followed by the Crowned Pigeons of New Guinea and the )Tj
T*(superficially Dodo-like Tooth-billed Pigeon from Samoa. The generic name of the )Tj
T*(latter is Didunculus \("little Dodo"\), and it was called "Dodlet" by Richard )Tj
T*(Owen. The following cladogram, from Shapiro and colleagues \(2002\), shows the )Tj
T*(Dodo's closest relationships within the Columbidae, a clade consisting of )Tj
T*(generally ground-dwelling island endemics. )Tj
T*( A similar cladogram was published in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura )Tj
T*(and Dicunculus and including the Pheasant Pigeon and the Thick-billed Ground )Tj
T*(Pigeon at the base of the clade. The 2002 study indicated that the ancestors of )Tj
T*(the Solitaire and the Dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The )Tj
T*(Mascarene Islands \(Mauritius, R√©union, and Rodrigues\), are of volcanic origin )Tj
T*(and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds )Tj
T*(probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the )Tj
T*(separation of their lineage. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for )Tj
T*(resources on these islands allowed the Solitaire and the Dodo to attain very )Tj
T*(large sizes. The DNA obtained from the Oxford specimen is degraded, and no )Tj
T*(usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains, so these findings still )Tj
T*(need to be independently verified. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti )Tj
T*(Levu Giant Pigeon, was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It )Tj
T*(was only slightly smaller than the Dodo and the Solitaire, and it too is )Tj
T*(thought to have been related to the Crowned Pigeons. )Tj

T*( One of the original names for the Dodo was the Dutch "walghvogel", first used )Tj
T*(in the journal of Vice Admiral Wybrand van Warwijck, who visited Mauritius )Tj
T*(during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia in 1598. His description, )Tj
T*(translated into English in 1599, explained the meaning of the name as follows: )Tj
T*(On their left hand was a little island which they named Heemskirk Island, and )Tj
T*(the bay it selve they called Warwick Bay¬†... finding in this place great )Tj
T*(quantity of foules twice as bigge as swans, which they call Walghstocks or )Tj
T*(Wallowbirdes being very good meat. But finding an abundance of pigeons &amp; )Tj
T*(popinnayes [parrots], they disdained any more to eat those great foules calling )Tj
T*(them Wallowbirds, that is to say lothsome or fulsome birdes.)Tj
T*( Another account from that voyage, perhaps the first to mention the Dodo, )Tj
T*(states that the Portuguese referred to them as penguins. The meaning may not )Tj
T*(have been derived from penguin, but from pinion, a reference to the small )Tj
T*(wings. The crew of the Dutch ship Gelderland referred to the bird as "Dronte" )Tj
T*(\(meaning "swollen"\) in 1602, a name that is still used in some languages. This )Tj
T*(crew also called them "griff-eendt" and "kermisgans", in reference to fowl )Tj
T*(fattened for the Kermesse festival in Amsterdam, which was held the day after )Tj
T*(they anchored on Mauritius. )Tj
T*( The etymology of the word Dodo is unclear. Some ascribe it to the Dutch word )Tj
T*(dodoor for "sluggard", but it is more probably related to Dodaars, which means )Tj
T*(either "fat-arse" or "knot-arse", referring to the knot of feathers on the hind )Tj
T*(end. The first record of the word Dodaars is in Captain Willem Van West-Zanen's )Tj
T*(journal in 1602. The English form "Dodar" was used until the 18th century. Sir )Tj
T*(Thomas Herbert was the first to use the word Dodo in print in his 1634 )Tj
T*(travelogue, claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese, who had )Tj
T*(visited Mauritius in 1507. Another Englishman, Emmanuel Altham, had used the )Tj
T*(word in a 1628 letter, in which he also claimed the origin was Portuguese. As )Tj
T*(far as is known, the Portuguese did not use the word. Nevertheless, some )Tj
T*(sources still state that the word Dodo derives from the Portuguese word doudo )Tj
T*(\(currently doido\), meaning "fool" or "crazy". David Quammen suggested that Dodo )Tj
T*(was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird's call, a two-note pigeon-like )Tj
T*(sound resembling "doo-doo". )Tj
T*( The Latin name cucullatus \("hooded"\) was first used by Juan Eusebio Nieremberg )Tj
T*(in 1635 as Cygnus cucullatus, in reference to Carolus Clusius' 1605 depiction )Tj
T*(of a Dodo. In his 18th-century classic work Systema Naturae, Carl Linnaeus used )Tj
T*(cucullatus as the specific name, but combined it with the genus name Struthio )Tj
T*(\(ostrich\).[10]Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the genus name Raphus \(referring )Tj
T*(to the bustards\) in 1760, resulting in the current name Raphus cucullatus. In )Tj
T*(1766, Linnaeus coined the new binomial Didus ineptus \(meaning "inept Dodo"\). )Tj
T*(This has become a synonym of the earlier name because of nomenclatural )Tj
T*(priority. )Tj
T*( Description )Tj
T*( As no complete Dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage )Tj
T*(and colouration, is hard to determine. Illustrations and written accounts of )Tj
T*(encounters with the Dodo between its discovery and its extinction \(1598‚Äì1662\) )Tj
T*(are the primary evidence for its external appearance. According to most )Tj
T*(representations, the Dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary )Tj
T*(feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was )Tj
T*(grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and )Tj
T*(yellowish, with black claws. Subfossil remains and remnants of the birds that )Tj
T*(were brought to Europe in the 17th century show that they were very large )Tj
T*(birds, one metre \(3.3¬†ft\) tall, and possibly weighing up to 23 kilograms \(51¬†)Tj
T*(lb\). The higher weights have been attributed to birds in captivity; weights in )Tj
T*(the wild were estimated to have been in the range 10.6‚Äì21.1¬†kg \(23‚Äì47¬†lb\). A )Tj
T*(later estimate gives an average weight as low as 10.2¬†kg \(22¬†lb\). This has been )Tj
T*(questioned, and there is still some controversy. It has been suggested that the )Tj
T*(weight depended on the season, and that individuals were fat during cool )Tj
T*(seasons, but less so during hot. The bird was sexually dimorphic: males were )Tj
T*(larger and had proportionally longer beaks. The beak was up to 23 centimetres )Tj
T*(\(9.1¬†in\) in length and had a hooked point. A study of the few remaining )Tj

T*(feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather )Tj
T*(than plumaceous \(downy\) and most similar to those of other pigeons. )Tj
T*( Many of the skeletal features that distinguish the Dodo and the Rodrigues )Tj
T*(Solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons have been attributed to their )Tj
T*(flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons )Tj
T*(to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were )Tj
T*(paedomorphic, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile )Tj
T*(features. The skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, meaning that they )Tj
T*(changed considerably with age. The Dodo shared several other traits with the )Tj
T*(Rodrigues Solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as )Tj
T*(well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more )Tj
T*(robust and shorter than the Solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a )Tj
T*(rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The Dodo's neck and legs were )Tj
T*(proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob )Tj

T*( Contemporary accounts )Tj

T*(kind, conspicuous for their size, larger than our swans, with huge heads only )Tj
T*(half covered with skin as if clothed with a hood. These birds lack wings, in )Tj
T*(the place of which 3 or 4 blackish feathers protrude. The tail consists of a )Tj
T*(few soft incurved feathers, which are ash coloured. These we used to call )Tj
T*('Walghvogel', for the reason that the longer and oftener they were cooked, the )Tj
T*(less soft and more insipid eating they became. Nevertheless their belly and )Tj
T*(breast were of a pleasant flavour and easily masticated.)Tj
T*( One of the most detailed descriptions is by Sir Thomas Herbert in A Relation )Tj
T*(of Some Yeares Travaille into Afrique and the Greater Asia from 1634: )Tj
T*(First here only and in Dygarrois [Rodrigues, likely referring to the Solitaire] )Tj
T*(is generated the Dodo, which for shape and rareness may antagonize the Phoenix )Tj
T*(of Arabia: her body is round and fat, few weigh less than fifty pound. It is )Tj
T*(reputed more for wonder than for food, greasie stomackes may seeke after them, )Tj
T*(but to the delicate they are offensive and of no nourishment. Her visage darts )Tj
T*(forth melancholy, as sensible of Nature's injurie in framing so great a body to )Tj
T*(be guided with complementall wings, so small and impotent, that they serve only )Tj
T*(to prove her bird. The halfe of her head is naked seeming couered with a fine )Tj
T*(vaile, her bill is crooked downwards, in midst is the trill [nostril], from )Tj
T*(which part to the end tis a light green, mixed with pale yellow tincture; her )Tj
T*(eyes are small and like to Diamonds, round and rowling; her clothing downy )Tj
T*(feathers, her train three small plumes, short and inproportionable, her legs )Tj

T*( Some twenty 17th-century illustrations of the Dodo are known that could have )Tj

T*(been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, )Tj
T*(and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often )Tj
T*(seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. )Tj
T*( The travel journal of the Dutch ship Gelderland \(1601‚Äì1603\), rediscovered in )Tj
T*(the 1860s, contains the only known sketches of living or recently killed )Tj
T*(specimens drawn on Mauritius. They have been attributed to the professional )Tj
T*(artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, who also drew other now-extinct Mauritian birds, )Tj
T*(and to a second, less refined artist. Apart from these sketches, it is unknown )Tj
T*(how many of the other illustrations were drawn from life or from stuffed )Tj
T*(specimens, affecting their reliability. )Tj
T*( The traditional image of the Dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this )Tj
T*(view may be exaggerated. The general opinion of scientists today is that many )Tj
T*(old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed )Tj
T*(specimens. Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential )Tj
T*(illustrator of the Dodo, having made at least ten depictions, often showing it )Tj
T*(in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called Edwards' )Tj
T*(Dodo as it was once owned by George Edwards, has since become the standard )Tj
T*(image of a Dodo. It is housed in the British Museum. The image shows a )Tj
T*(particularly fat bird and is the source for many other Dodo illustrations. )Tj
T*( An Indian Mughal painting rediscovered in St. Petersburg in the 1950s shows a )Tj
T*(Dodo along with native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and )Tj
T*(its discoverer A. Iwanow and Dodo specialist Julian Hume regard it as one of )Tj
T*(the most accurate depictions of the living Dodo; the surrounding birds are )Tj
T*(clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to )Tj
T*(be from the 17th century and has been attributed to artist Ustad Mansur. The )Tj
T*(bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, )Tj
T*(located in Surat, where English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen )Tj
T*(Dodos. )Tj
T*( Behaviour and ecology )Tj
T*( Little is known of the behaviour of the Dodo, as most contemporary )Tj
T*(descriptions are very brief. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg )Tj
T*(bones indicate that it could run quite fast. As it was flightless and )Tj
T*(terrestrial and there were no mammalian predators or other kinds of natural )Tj
T*(enemy on Mauritius, it probably nested on the ground. The account by Fran√ßois )Tj
T*(Cauche from 1651 is the only description of the egg and the call: )Tj
T*(I have seen in Mauritius birds bigger than a Swan, without feathers on the )Tj
T*(body, which is covered with a black down; the hinder part is round, the rump )Tj
T*(adorned with curled feathers as many in number as the bird is years old. In )Tj
T*(place of wings they have feathers like these last, black and curved, without )Tj
T*(webs. They have no tongues, the beak is large, curving a little downwards; )Tj
T*(their legs are long, scaly, with only three toes on each foot. It has a cry )Tj
T*(like a gosling, and is by no means so savoury to eat as the Flamingos and Ducks )Tj
T*(of which we have just spoken. They only lay one egg which is white, the size of )Tj
T*(a halfpenny roll, by the side of which they place a white stone the size of a )Tj
T*(hen's egg. They lay on grass which they collect, and make their nests in the )Tj
T*(forests; if one kills the young one, a grey stone is found in the gizzard. We )Tj
T*(call them Oiseaux de Nazaret. The fat is excellent to give ease to the muscles )Tj
T*(and nerves.[10])Tj
T*( Cauche's account is problematic, since it also mentions that the bird he was )Tj
T*(describing had three toes and no tongue, unlike Dodos. This led some to believe )Tj
T*(that Cauche was describing a new species of Dodo \("Didus nazarenus"\). The )Tj
T*(description was most probably mingled with that of a cassowary, and Cauche's )Tj
T*(writings have other inconsistencies. A mention of a "young ostrich" taken on )Tj
T*(board a ship in 1617 is the only other reference to a possible juvenile Dodo. )Tj
T*( Because of the single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been )Tj
T*(proposed that the Dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of )Tj
T*(altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some )Tj
T*(evidence, including the large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous )Tj
T*(birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a )Tj
T*(protracted development period. )Tj

T*( The preferred habitat of the Dodo is unknown, but old descriptions suggest )Tj
T*(that it inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west )Tj
T*(Mauritius. This view is supported by the fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, )Tj
T*(where most Dodo remains have been found, is close to the sea in south-eastern )Tj
T*(Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have )Tj
T*(contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a )Tj
T*(small island off the coast of Mauritius where Dodos were caught. It has been )Tj
T*(suggested this island was in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. )Tj
T*(Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating )Tj
T*(that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown )Tj
T*(that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic )Tj
T*(palms. )Tj
T*( Many endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of humans, )Tj
T*(so the ecosystem of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before )Tj
T*(humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little )Tj
T*(remains of them today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is )Tj
T*(still seriously threatened. The Dodo lived alongside other recently extinct )Tj
T*(Mauritian birds such as the flightless Red Rail, the Broad-billed Parrot, )Tj
T*(Thirioux's Grey Parrot, the Mauritius Blue Pigeon, the Mauritius Owl, the )Tj
T*(Mascarene Coot, the Mauritian Shelduck, the Mauritian Duck, and the Mauritius )Tj
T*(Night Heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the Saddle-backed Mauritius )Tj
T*(giant tortoise, the Domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian Giant Skink, )Tj
T*(and the Round Island Burrowing Boa. The Small Mauritian Flying Fox and the )Tj
T*(snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and R√©union, but vanished from )Tj
T*(both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the Palm Orchid, have )Tj
T*(also become extinct. )Tj
T*( Diet )Tj
T*( A 1631 Dutch document, rediscovered in 1887 but now lost, is the only account )Tj
T*(of the Dodo's diet and also mentions that it used its beak for defence: )Tj
T*(These mayors are superb and proud. They displayed themselves to us with stiff )Tj
T*(and stern faces, and wide-open mouths. Jaunty and audacious of gait, they would )Tj
T*(scarcely move a foot before us. Their war weapon was their mouth, with which )Tj
T*(they could bite fiercely; their food was fruit; they were not well feathered )Tj
T*(but abundantly covered with fat. Many of them were brought onboard to the )Tj
T*(delight of us all.)Tj
T*( In addition to fallen fruits, the Dodo probably subsisted on nuts, seeds, )Tj
T*(bulbs, and roots. Anthonie Oudemans suggested that as Mauritius has marked dry )Tj
T*(and wet seasons, the Dodo probably fattened itself on ripe fruits at the end of )Tj
T*(the wet season to survive the dry season, when food was scarce; contemporary )Tj
T*(reports describe the bird's "greedy" appetite.France Staub suggested that they )Tj
T*(mainly fed on palm fruits, and he attempted to correlate the fat-cycle of the )Tj
T*(Dodo with the fruiting regime of the palms. It has also been suggested that the )Tj
T*(Dodo might have eaten crabs and shellfish, like their relatives the Crowned )Tj
T*(Pigeons. Its feeding habits must have been versatile, since captive specimens )Tj
T*(were probably given a wide range of food on the long sea journeys. )Tj
T*( Several contemporary sources state that the Dodo used gizzard stones to aid )Tj
T*(digestion. The English writer Sir Hamon L'Estrange witnessed a live bird in )Tj
T*(London and described it as follows: )Tj
T*(About 1638, as I walked London streets, I saw the picture of a strange looking )Tj
T*(fowle hung out upon a clothe and myselfe with one or two more in company went )Tj
T*(in to see it. It was kept in a chamber, and was a great fowle somewhat bigger )Tj
T*(than the largest Turkey cock, and so legged and footed, but stouter and thicker )Tj
T*(and of more erect shape, coloured before like the breast of a young cock fesan, )Tj
T*(and on the back of a dunn or dearc colour. The keeper called it a Dodo, and in )Tj
T*(the ende of a chymney in the chamber there lay a heape of large pebble stones, )Tj
T*(whereof hee gave it many in our sight, some as big as nutmegs, and the keeper )Tj
T*(told us that she eats them \(conducing to digestion\), and though I remember not )Tj
T*(how far the keeper was questioned therein, yet I am confident that afterwards )Tj
T*(she cast them all again.)Tj
T*( It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. )Tj

T*(Contemporary depictions show a large crop, which was probably used to add space )Tj
T*(for food storage and to produce crop milk. It has been suggested that the )Tj
T*(maximum size attained by the Dodo and the Solitaire was limited by the amount )Tj
T*(of crop milk they could produce for their young during early growth. )Tj
T*( In 1973, the tambalacoque, also known as the "Dodo tree", was thought to be )Tj
T*(dying out on Mauritus, to which it is endemic. There were supposedly only 13 )Tj
T*(specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. Stanley Temple )Tj
T*(hypothesised that it depended on the Dodo for its propagation, and that its )Tj
T*(seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract. He )Tj
T*(claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly coextinct because of the )Tj
T*(disappearance of the Dodo. Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found )Tj
T*(that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being abraded )Tj
T*(during digestion. Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the )Tj
T*(decline of the tree was exaggerated, or seeds were also distributed by other )Tj
T*(extinct animals such as Cylindraspis tortoises, fruit bats or the Broad-billed )Tj
T*(Parrot. According to Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in the ecology )Tj
T*(of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while rare, has germinated since the demise )Tj
T*(of the Dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence )Tj
T*(discrediting Temple's view as to the Dodo and the tree's sole survival )Tj
T*(relationship. )Tj
T*( It has also been suggested that the Broad-Billed Parrot may have depended on )Tj
T*(Dodos and Cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, )Tj
T*(which became food for the parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct )Tj
T*(South American megafauna in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle )Tj
T*(for this service. )Tj
T*( Relationship with humans )Tj
T*( Mauritius had previously been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and )Tj
T*(Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, but was settled by neither. No records )Tj
T*(of Dodos by these are known, although the Portuguese name for Mauritius, "Cerne )Tj
T*(\(swan\) Island", may have been a reference to Dodos. The Dutch Empire acquired )Tj
T*(Mauritius in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used for the )Tj
T*(provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company henceforward. The )Tj
T*(earliest known descriptions of the Dodo were provided by Dutch travellers )Tj
T*(during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia, led by Admiral Jacob van Neck )Tj
T*(in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first )Tj
T*(published illustration of the bird. Since the first sailors to visit Mauritius )Tj
T*(had been at sea for a long time, their interest in these large birds was mainly )Tj
T*(culinary. Although later writings describe the meat as unsavoury, early )Tj
T*(journals state that it was tough but good. The 1602 journal by Willem Van )Tj
T*(West-Zanen of the ship Bruin-Vis mentions that 24-25 Dodos were hunted for )Tj
T*(food, which were so large that two could scarcely be consumed at mealtime, )Tj
T*(their remains being preserved by salting. An illustration made for the 1648 )Tj
T*(published version of this journal, showing the killing of Dodos, a dugong, and )Tj
T*(possibly a Thirioux's Grey Parrot, was captioned with a Dutch poem, here in )Tj
T*(Hugh Strickland's translation: )Tj
T*(For food the seamen hunt the flesh of feathered fowl,)Tj
T*(They tap the palms, and round-rumped dodos they destroy,)Tj
T*(The parrot's life they spare that he may peep and howl,)Tj
T*(And thus his fellows to imprisonment decoy.)Tj
T*( The appearance of the Dodo and the Red Rail led Peter Mundy to speculate, 230 )Tj

T*(contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in European museums. )Tj
T*(Hamon L'Estrange's description of a Dodo that he saw in London in 1638 is the )Tj
T*(only account that specifically mentions a live specimen in Europe. In 1626 )Tj
T*(Adriaen van de Venne drew a Dodo that he claimed to have seen in Amsterdam, but )Tj

T*(Savery's Edwards' Dodo. Two live specimens were seen by Peter Mundy in Surat, )Tj
T*(India, between 1628 and 1634, one of which may have been the individual painted )Tj
T*(by Ustad Mansur around 1625. One Dodo was sent as far as Nagasaki, Japan in )Tj
T*(1647, but it is unknown whether it arrived. In 1628, Emmanuel Altham visited )Tj
T*(Mauritius and sent a letter to his brother in England: )Tj
T*(Right wo and lovinge brother,)Tj
T*(We were ordered by ye said councell to go to an island called Mauritius, lying )Tj
T*(in 20d. of south latt., where we arrived ye 28th of May; this island having )Tj
T*(many goates, hogs and cowes upon it, and very strange fowles, called by ye )Tj

T*([In the margin of the letter] Of Mr. Perce you shall receive a jarr of ginger )Tj
T*(for my sister, some beades for my cousins your daughters, and a bird called a )Tj
T*(Dodo, if it live.)Tj
T*( Whether the Dodo survived the journey is unknown, and the letter was destroyed )Tj
T*(by fire in the 19th century. )Tj
T*( The earliest known picture of a Dodo specimen in Europe is from a ca. 1610 )Tj
T*(collection of paintings depicting animals in the royal menagerie of Emperor )Tj
T*(Rudolph II in Prague. This collection includes paintings of other Mauritian )Tj
T*(animals as well, including a Red Rail. The Dodo, which may be a juvenile, seems )Tj
T*(to have been dried or embalmed, and had probably lived in the emperor's zoo for )Tj
T*(a while together with the other animals. That whole stuffed Dodos were present )Tj
T*(in Europe indicates they had been brought alive and died there; it is unlikely )Tj
T*(that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships, and spirits were not yet )Tj
T*(used to preserve biological specimens. Most tropical specimens were preserved )Tj
T*(as dried heads and feet. Based on a combination of contemporary accounts, )Tj
T*(paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven )Tj
T*(transported Dodos reached their destinations alive. )Tj
T*( Extinction )Tj
T*( Like many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators, the )Tj
T*(Dodo was entirely fearless of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to )Tj
T*(fly made the Dodo easy prey for sailors. Although some scattered reports )Tj
T*(describe mass killings of Dodos for ships' provisions, archaeological )Tj
T*(investigations have found scant evidence of human predation. Bones of at least )Tj
T*(two Dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and )Tj
T*(convicts in the 17th century and would not have been easily accessible to Dodos )Tj
T*(because of the high, broken terrain. The human population on Mauritius \(an area )Tj
T*(of 1,860 km2 or 720¬†sq¬†mi\) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but )Tj
T*(they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and )Tj
T*(crab-eating macaques, which plundered Dodo nests and competed for the limited )Tj
T*(food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the Dodo's forest habitat. )Tj
T*(The impact of these introduced animals, especially the pigs and macaques, on )Tj
T*(the Dodo population is currently considered more severe than that of hunting. )Tj
T*(Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests, since Dodos would have )Tj
T*(been used to dealing with local land crabs. )Tj
T*( It has been suggested that the Dodo may already have been rare or localised )Tj
T*(before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to )Tj
T*(become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the )Tj
T*(island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of Dodos and other animals )Tj
T*(killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a )Tj
T*(species already in danger of becoming extinct. )Tj

T*(accepted record of a Dodo sighting is the 1662 report by shipwrecked mariner )Tj
T*(Volkert Evertsz of the Dutch ship Arnhem, who described birds caught on a small )Tj
T*(islet off Mauritius, now suggested to be Amber Island: )Tj
T*(These animals on our coming up to them stared at us and remained quiet where )Tj
T*(they stand, not knowing whether they had wings to fly away or legs to run off, )Tj
T*(and suffering us to approach them as close as we pleased. Amongst these birds )Tj
T*(were those which in India they call Dod-aersen \(being a kind of very big )Tj
T*(goose\); these birds are unable to fly, and instead of wings, they merely have a )Tj
T*(few small pins, yet they can run very swiftly. We drove them together into one )Tj
T*(place in such a manner that we could catch them with our hands, and when we )Tj
T*(held one of them by its leg, and that upon this it made a great noise, the )Tj
T*(others all on a sudden came running as fast as they could to its assistance, )Tj
T*(and by which they were caught and made prisoners also.)Tj
T*( The last claimed sighting of a Dodo was reported in the hunting records of )Tj
T*(Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by )Tj
T*(Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% )Tj
T*(confidence interval of 1688‚Äì1715. The authors also pointed out that because the )Tj
T*(last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the Dodo was probably already quite rare )Tj
T*(by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot )Tj
T*(be dismissed out of hand. )Tj
T*( Anthony Cheke pointed out that some descriptions after 1662 use the names )Tj
T*("Dodo" and "Dodaers" when referring to the Red Rail, indicating that they had )Tj
T*(been transferred to it after the disappearance of the Dodo itself. Cheke )Tj
T*(therefore points to the 1662 description as the last credible observation. )Tj
T*(Until this explanation was proposed, a description of "Dodos" from 1681 was )Tj
T*(thought to be the last account. A 1668 account by English traveller John )Tj
T*(Marshall, who used the names "Dodo" and "Red Hen" interchangeably for the Red )Tj
T*(Rail, mentioned that the meat was "hard", which echoes the description of the )Tj
T*(meat in the 1681 account. Even the 1662 account has been questioned by Errol )Tj
T*(Fuller, as the reaction to distress cries matches what was described for the )Tj
T*(Red Rail. The IUCN Red List accepts Cheke's rationale for choosing the 1662 )Tj
T*(date, taking all subsequent reports to refer to Red Rails. In any case, the )Tj
T*(Dodo was probably extinct by 1700, about a century after its discovery in 1598. )Tj
T*(The Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, but by then the Dodo and most of the large )Tj
T*(terrestrial vertebrates there had become extinct. )Tj
T*( Even though the rareness of the Dodo was reported already in the 17th century, )Tj
T*(its extinction was not recognised until the 19th century. This was partly )Tj
T*(because, for religious reasons, extinction was not believed possible until )Tj
T*(later proved so by Georges Cuvier, and partly because many scientists doubted )Tj
T*(that the Dodo had ever existed. It seemed altogether too strange a creature, )Tj
T*(and many believed it a myth. The bird was first used as an example of )Tj
T*(human-induced extinction in Penny Magazine in 1833. )Tj
T*( Physical remains )Tj
T*( 17th century specimens )Tj
T*( The only extant remains of Dodos taken to Europe in the 17th century are a )Tj
T*(dried head and foot in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, a foot )Tj
T*(once housed in the British Museum but now lost, a skull in the University of )Tj
T*(Copenhagen Zoological Museum, and an upper jaw and leg bones in the National )Tj
T*(Museum, Prague. The last two were rediscovered and identified as Dodo remains )Tj
T*(in the mid-19th century. Other stuffed Dodos were mentioned in old museum )Tj
T*(inventories, but none are known to have survived. )Tj
T*( The only known soft tissue remains, the Oxford head \(specimen OUM 11605\) and )Tj
T*(foot, belonged to the last known stuffed Dodo, which was first mentioned as )Tj
T*(part of the Tradescant collection in 1656 and was moved to the Ashmolean Museum )Tj
T*(in 1659. It has been suggested that this might be the remains of the bird that )Tj
T*(Hamon L'Estrange saw in London. Many sources state that the museum burned the )Tj
T*(stuffed Dodo around 1755 because of severe decay, saving only the head and leg. )Tj
T*(Statute 8 of the museum states "That as any particular grows old and perishing )Tj

T*(of it. This remaining soft tissue has since degraded further; the head was )Tj
T*(dissected by Strickland and Melville, separating the skin from the skull in two )Tj

T*(Very few feathers remain on the head. It is probably a female, as the foot is )Tj
T*(11% smaller and more gracile than that of the London specimen, yet appears to )Tj
T*(be fully grown. )Tj
T*( The dried London foot, first mentioned in 1665, was long displayed in the )Tj
T*(British Museum next to Savery's Edwards' Dodo painting, and it too was )Tj
T*(dissected by Strickland and Melville. By 1896 it was mentioned as being without )Tj
T*(its integuments, and only the bones are believed to remain today. Its present )Tj
T*(whereabouts are unknown. )Tj
T*( The Copenhagen skull \(specimen ZMUC 90-806\) is known to have been part of the )Tj
T*(collection of Bernardus Paludanus in Enkhuizen until 1651, when it was moved to )Tj
T*(the museum in Gottorf Castle, Schleswig. After the castle was occupied by )Tj
T*(Danish forces in 1702, the museum collection was assimilated into the Royal )Tj
T*(Danish collection. The skull was rediscovered by J. T. Reinhardt in 1840. It is )Tj
T*(13¬†mm shorter than the Oxford skull, and may have belonged to a female. It was )Tj
T*(mummified, but the skin has perished. Its sclerotic ring is preserved. )Tj
T*( The front part of a skull \(specimen NMP P6V-004389\) and some leg bones in the )Tj
T*(National Museum of Prague were found in 1850 among the remains of the )Tj
T*(B√∂hmisches Museum. It may be what remains of one of the stuffed Dodos known to )Tj
T*(have been at the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted )Tj
T*(by Hoefnagel or Savery there. )Tj
T*( Apart from these remains, a dried foot was mentioned by Carolus Clusius in )Tj
T*(1605, but is now lost. It belonged to the Dutch professor Pieter Pauw, and its )Tj
T*(provenance is unknown. It may have been collected during the Van Neck voyage. )Tj
T*( Subfossil specimens )Tj
T*( Until 1860, the only known Dodo remains were the four incomplete 17th-century )Tj
T*(specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones, which were )Tj
T*(sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. )Tj
T*(In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word that )Tj
T*(he should be informed if any Dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the )Tj
T*(government schoolmaster at Mah√©bourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil )Tj
T*(Dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a )Tj
T*(30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark )Tj
T*(explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his )Tj
T*(coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their )Tj
T*(feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered )Tj
T*(the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded )Tj
T*(the remains of over 300 Dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly )Tj
T*(because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was )Tj
T*(trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of Moa remains in New Zealand )Tj
T*(marshes. )Tj
T*( Clark's reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird. Sir Richard )Tj
T*(Owen and Alfred Newton both wanted to be first to describe the post-cranial )Tj
T*(anatomy of the Dodo, and Owen bought a shipment of Dodo bones originally meant )Tj
T*(for Newton, which led to rivalry between the two. Owen described the bones in )Tj
T*(Memoir on the Dodo in October 1866, but erroneously based his reconstruction on )Tj
T*(the Edwards' Dodo painting by Savery, making it too squat and obese. In 1869 he )Tj
T*(received more bones and corrected its stance, making it more upright. Newton )Tj
T*(moved his focus to the R√©union Solitaire instead. The remaining bones not sold )Tj
T*(to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums. )Tj
T*( In 1889, Th√©odor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the "historical )Tj
T*(souvenirs" of Mauritius and find more Dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes. He )Tj
T*(was successful, and also found remains of other extinct species. A barber named )Tj
T*(Louis Etienne Thirioux also found many Dodo remains around 1900, which are now )Tj
T*(lost. They included the first remains of a juvenile and the first articulated )Tj
T*(specimen. It is unknown exactly where he made his finds, except that some were )Tj
T*(found in a cave, which may have been located on the slopes of Le Pouce )Tj

T*( Worldwide, 26 museums have significant holdings of Dodo material, almost all )Tj
T*(found in the Mare aux Songes. The Natural History Museum, American Museum of )Tj
T*(Natural History, Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, the Senckenberg )Tj
T*(Museum, and others have almost complete specimens assembled from these )Tj
T*(dissociated subfossil remains. An egg claimed to be that of a Dodo is stored in )Tj
T*(the museum of East London, South Africa. It was donated by Marjorie )Tj
T*(Courtenay-Latimer, whose great aunt had received it from a captain who claimed )Tj
T*(to have found it in a swamp on Mauritius. In 2010, the curator of the museum )Tj
T*(proposed using genetic studies to determine its authenticity. It may instead be )Tj
T*(an aberrant ostrich egg. )Tj
T*( In October 2005, after a hundred years of neglect, a part of the Mare aux )Tj
T*(Songes swamp was excavated by an international team of researchers. To prevent )Tj
T*(malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule )Tj
T*(over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including )Tj
T*(bones of at least 17 Dodos in various stages of maturity \(though no juveniles\), )Tj
T*(and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which )Tj
T*(have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public )Tj
T*(in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in )Tj
T*(the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% )Tj
T*(belonged to Dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 )Tj
T*(years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that Dodos and other animals became )Tj
T*(mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period )Tj
T*(of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. )Tj
T*( In June 2007, adventurers exploring a cave in Mauritius discovered the most )Tj
T*(complete and best-preserved Dodo skeleton ever found. The specimen was )Tj
T*(nicknamed "Fred" after the finder. In 2011, a wooden box containing Dodo bones )Tj
T*(from the Edwardian era was rediscovered at the Grant Museum at University )Tj
T*(College London during preparations for a move. )Tj
T*( The White Dodo )Tj
T*( The supposed "White Dodo" \(or "Solitaire"\) of R√©union is now considered an )Tj
T*(erroneous conjecture based on contemporary reports of the R√©union Ibis and )Tj
T*(17th-century paintings of white, Dodo-like birds by Pieter Withoos and Pieter )Tj
T*(Holsteyn that surfaced in the 19th century. The confusion began when Willem )Tj
T*(Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe, who visited R√©union around 1619, mentioned fat, )Tj
T*(flightless birds that he referred to as "Dod-eersen" in his journal, though )Tj
T*(without mentioning their colouration. When the journal was published in 1646, )Tj
T*(it was accompanied by a copy of Savery's "Crocker Art Gallery sketch". A white, )Tj
T*(stocky, and flightless bird was first mentioned as part of the R√©union fauna by )Tj
T*(Chief Officer J. Tatton in 1625. Sporadic mentions were subsequently made by )Tj
T*(Sieur Dubois and other contemporary writers. )Tj
T*( Baron Edmund de S√©lys-Longchamps coined the name Raphus solitarius for these )Tj
T*(birds in 1848, as he believed the accounts referred to a species of Dodo. When )Tj
T*(17th-century paintings of white Dodos were discovered by 19th century )Tj
T*(naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis )Tj
T*(Oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between the paintings and the old )Tj
T*(descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was )Tj
T*(therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described )Tj
T*(were of a species similar to the Rodrigues Solitaire, as it was referred to by )Tj
T*(the same name, or even that there were white species of both Dodo and Solitaire )Tj
T*(on the island. )Tj
T*( The Pieter Withoos painting, which was discovered first, appears to be based )Tj
T*(on an earlier painting by Pieter Holsteyn, three versions of which are known to )Tj
T*(have existed. According to Hume, Cheke, and Valledor de Lozoya, it appears that )Tj
T*(all depictions of white Dodos were based on Roelant Savery's 1611 painting )Tj
T*(Landscape with Orpheus and the animals, or on copies of it. The painting shows )Tj
T*(a whitish specimen and was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in )Tj
T*(Prague; a walghvogel described as having a "dirty off-white colouring" was )Tj
T*(mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the Holy )Tj
T*(Roman Emperor Rudolf II, to whom Savery was contracted at the time \(1607‚Äì1611\). )Tj

T*(Savery's several later images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had )Tj
T*(by then seen another specimen. Cheke and Hume believe the painted specimen was )Tj
T*(white due to albinism. Valledor de Lozoya has instead suggested that the light )Tj
T*(plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, )Tj
T*(or simply artistic license. )Tj
T*( In 1987, scientists described fossils of a recently extinct species of ibis )Tj
T*(from R√©union with a relatively short beak, Borbonibis latipes, before a )Tj
T*(connection to the Solitaire reports had been made. Cheke suggested to one of )Tj
T*(the authors, Francois Moutou, that the fossils may have been of the R√©union )Tj
T*(Solitaire, and this suggestion was published in 1995. The ibis was reassigned )Tj
T*(to the genus Threskiornis, now combined with the specific epithet solitarius )Tj
T*(from the binomial R. solitarius. Birds of this genus are also white and black )Tj
T*(with slender beaks, fitting the old descriptions of the R√©union Solitaire. No )Tj
T*(fossil remains of Dodo-like birds have ever been found on the island. )Tj
T*( Cultural significance )Tj
T*( The Dodo's significance as one of the best-known extinct animals and its )Tj
T*(singular appearance led to its use in literature and popular culture as a )Tj
T*(symbol of an outdated concept or object, as in the expression "dead as a Dodo," )Tj
T*(which has come to mean unquestionably dead or obsolete. Similarly, the phrase )Tj
T*("to go the way of the Dodo" means to become extinct or obsolete, to fall out of )Tj
T*(common usage or practice, or to become a thing of the past. In 1865, the same )Tj
T*(year that George Clark started to publish reports about excavated Dodo fossils, )Tj
T*(the newly vindicated bird was featured as a character in Lewis Carroll's )Tj
T*(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It is thought that he included the Dodo )Tj
T*(because he identified with it and had adopted the name as a nickname for )Tj
T*(himself because of his stammer, which made him accidentally introduce himself )Tj
T*(as "Do-do-dodgson", his legal surname. The book's popularity made the Dodo a )Tj
T*(well-known icon of extinction. )Tj
T*( Today, the Dodo appears frequently in works of popular fiction and is used as )Tj
T*(a mascot for many kinds of products, especially in Mauritius. The Dodo appears )Tj
T*(as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius. It is also use as a watermark )Tj
T*(on all Mauritian rupee banknote. A smiling Dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries )Tj
T*(de Bourbon, a popular brewer on R√©union, whose emblem displays the white )Tj
T*(species once thought to have lived there. )Tj
T*( The Dodo is used to promote the protection of endangered species by many )Tj
T*(environmental organisations, such as the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust )Tj
T*(and the Durrell Wildlife Park. In 2011, the nephilid spider Nephilengys dodo, )Tj
T*(which inhabits the same woods as the Dodo once did, was named after the bird to )Tj
T*(raise awareness of the urgent need for protection of the Mauritius biota. The )Tj
T*(name Dodo has also been immortalized by scientists naming genetic elements, )Tj
T*(honoring the Dodo's flightless nature. A fruitfly gene within a region of a )Tj
T*(chromosome required for flying ability was named "dodo". In addition, a )Tj
T*(defective transposable element family from Phytophthora infestans was named )Tj
T*("dodo" as it contained mutations that eliminated the element's ability to jump )Tj
T*(to new locations in a chromosome. )Tj
T*( In 2009, a previously unpublished 17th-century Dutch illustration of a Dodo )Tj
T*(went for sale at Christie's and was expected to sell for ¬£6,000. It is unknown )Tj
T*(whether the illustration was based on a specimen or on a previous image. It )Tj
T*(sold for ¬£44,450. )Tj
T*( The poet Hilaire Belloc included the following poem about the Dodo in his Bad )Tj
T*(Child's Book of Beasts from 1896: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The Dodo used to walk around,)Tj
T*(And take the sun and air.)Tj
T*(The sun yet warms his native ground ‚Äì)Tj

T*( In 2000, James Patton, Maria da Silva, and Jay Malcolm reported on mammals )Tj
T*(collected at the Rio Juru√° in western Brazil. In this report, they provided )Tj
T*(further information on the Oryzomys species reviewed by Musser and colleagues, )Tj
T*(including sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Their )Tj
T*(analysis reaffirmed that O.¬†emmonsae was a distinct species and found that it )Tj
T*(was closest to O.¬†macconnelli and O.¬†russatus, differing from both by about 12% )Tj
T*(in the cytochrome b sequence; O.¬†nitidus was more distantly related, differing )Tj
T*(by 14.7%. The average sequence difference between the three O.¬†emmonsae studied )Tj
T*(was 0.8%.[8] )Tj
T*( In 2006, an extensive morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis by )Tj
T*(Marcelo Weksler showed that species then placed in the genus Oryzomys did not )Tj
T*(form a single, cohesive \(monophyletic\) group; for example, O.¬†macconnelli, O.¬†)Tj
T*(lamia \(placed under O.¬†russatus by Musser and colleagues\) and O.¬†russatus )Tj
T*(clustered together in a single natural group \(clade\), but were not closely )Tj
T*(related to the type species of Oryzomys, the marsh rice rat \(O.¬†palustris\).[9] )Tj
T*(Later in 2006, Weksler and colleagues described several new genera to )Tj
T*(accommodate species previously placed in Oryzomys, among which was Euryoryzomys )Tj
T*(for the "O.¬†nitidus complex", including O.¬†emmonsae.[4] )Tj
T*( Thus, the species is now known as Euryoryzomys emmonsae.[1] As a species of )Tj
T*(Euryoryzomys, it is classified within the tribe Oryzomyini \("rice rats"\), which )Tj
T*(includes over a hundred species, mainly from South and Central America.[10] )Tj
T*(Oryzomyini in turn is part of the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, )Tj
T*(along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( Euryoryzomys emmonsae is a fairly large,[12] long-tailed rice rat with long, )Tj
T*(soft fur. The hairs on the back are 8 to 10¬†mm \(0.3 to 0.4¬†in\) long.[13] It )Tj
T*(generally resembles E.¬†nitidus in these and other characters, but has a longer )Tj
T*(tail.[3]E.¬†macconnelli is slightly larger and has longer and duller fur. In E.¬†)Tj
T*(emmonsae, the upperparts are tawny brown, but a bit darker on the head because )Tj
T*(many hairs have black tips. The hairs of the underparts are gray at the bases )Tj
T*(and white at the tips; overall, the fur appears mostly white. In most )Tj
T*(specimens, there is a patch on the chest where the gray bases are absent. The )Tj
T*(longest of the vibrissae \(whiskers\) of the face extend slightly beyond the )Tj
T*(ears. The eyelids are black. The ears are covered with small, yellowish brown )Tj
T*(hairs and appear dark brown overall. The feet are covered with white hairs )Tj
T*(above and brown below. There are six pads on the plantar surface, but the )Tj
T*(hypothenar is reduced. The ungual tufts, tufts of hair which surround the bases )Tj
T*(of the claws, are well-developed. The tail is like the body in color above, and )Tj
T*(mostly white below, but in the 10¬†mm \(0.4¬†in\) nearest the tail tip it is brown )Tj
T*(below.[13] )Tj
T*( Compared to E.¬†nitidus[3] and E.¬†macconnelli, the skull is relatively small )Tj
T*(and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina \(perforations of the )Tj
T*(palate between the incisors and the molars\) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities )Tj
T*(which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate. )Tj
T*(The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the )Tj
T*(arteries of the head.[13] The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the )Tj
T*(alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina \(openings\) in the skull \(the )Tj
T*(masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorius\) is rarely )Tj
T*(present; its presence is more frequent in E.¬†nitidus.[14] The capsular process, )Tj
T*(a raising of the bone of the mandible \(lower jaw\) behind the third molar, )Tj
T*(houses the back end of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in )Tj
T*(E.¬†emmonsae and E.¬†macconnelli.[15] Traits of the teeth are similar to those of )Tj
T*(E.¬†nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.[16] )Tj
T*( The karyotype includes 80 chromosomes with a total of 86 major arms \(2n¬†=¬†80; )Tj
T*(FN¬†=¬†86\). The X chromosome is subtelocentric \(with one pair of long arms and )Tj

T*( There is a definite seasonal pattern to editor activity, with more editors )Tj
T*(active during the North American school year than during its summer break. )Tj
T*( About 250,000 new accounts are created every month. About 300,000 editors have )Tj
T*(edited Wikipedia more than 10 times. 134,269 have performed an edit within the )Tj
T*(last 30 days.[5] )Tj
T*( The Wikipedians with the 5,000 highest edit counts are listed here. )Tj
T*( [edit] Demographics )Tj
T*( Based on a survey of over 58,000 self-selected Wikipedians by a group at )Tj
T*(UNU-Merit published in March 2010, contributors can be split into four )Tj
T*(approximately equal age-groups: those under 18, those between 18 and 22, those )Tj
T*(from 22 to 30 and the remainder between 30 and 85.[6] About 23% of contributors )Tj
T*(have completed degree-level education, 26% are undergraduates and 45% have )Tj
T*(secondary education or less. 87% are men and 13% women. The survey included )Tj
T*(users of 22 language editions in 231 countries.[6] )Tj
T*( Various information about individual Wikipedians is available on the user )Tj
T*(pages of Wikipedians who choose to create them. )Tj
T*( [edit] Personality )Tj
T*( Researchers around the world have begun to identify key personality traits in )Tj
T*(Wikipedians. According to a study published in 2008, Wikipedia members are more )Tj
T*(likely than non-members to locate their 'real me' online‚Äîthat is, to feel more )Tj
T*(comfortable expressing their "real" selves online than off.[7] This corresponds )Tj
T*(with more general findings that Internet communities tend to attract users who )Tj
T*(are introverted offline but more able to open up and feel empowered on the )Tj
T*(Web.[8][9] A gender difference was found in terms of extroversion: whereas )Tj
T*(female Wikipedia members were on average more introverted than female )Tj
T*(non-members, male members were just as extroverted as males in the control )Tj
T*(group. Wikipedians have also been found to be less agreeable, and less open, as )Tj
T*(defined by psychology‚Äôs Big Five personality traits.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Motivations for contributing )Tj
T*( A 2010 study found that although members may initially contribute to the site )Tj
T*(for pleasure, they are motivated primarily by an internal drive to feel )Tj
T*(efficacious and self-confident. Aside from potentially fueling a first-time )Tj
T*(contribution, enjoyment was found to have no significant impact on )Tj

T*( [edit] Nomenclature )Tj
T*( It has been suggested that Wikipedist would be a more appropriate name, as an )Tj
T*(encyclopedist is someone who contributes to an encyclopedia. "Wikipedian", )Tj

T*(known animal to have ever existed.[6] )Tj
T*( Long and slender, the blue whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey )Tj
T*(dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath.[7] There are at least three distinct )Tj
T*(subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. )Tj
T*(intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda \(also known as the pygmy )Tj
T*(blue whale\) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, )Tj
T*(found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen )Tj
T*(whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as )Tj
T*(krill.[8] )Tj
T*( Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the )Tj
T*(beginning of the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost )Tj
T*(to extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in )Tj
T*(1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales )Tj

T*( Taxonomy )Tj
T*( Blue whales are rorquals \(family Balaenopteridae\), a family that includes the )Tj
T*(humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke )Tj
T*(whale.[3] The family Balaenopteridae is believed to have diverged from the )Tj
T*(other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Oligocene. )Tj
T*(It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other. )Tj
T*( The blue whale is usually classified as one of eight species in the genus )Tj
T*(Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, )Tj
T*(Sibbaldus,[12] but this is not accepted elsewhere.[1]DNA sequencing analysis )Tj
T*(indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale )Tj
T*(\(Balaenoptera borealis\) and Bryde's whale \(Balaenoptera brydei\) than to other )Tj
T*(Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale \(Megaptera\) and the gray )Tj
T*(whale \(Eschrichtius\) than to the minke whales \(Balaenoptera acutorostrata and )Tj
T*(Balaenoptera bonaerensis\).[13][14] If further research confirms these )Tj
T*(relationships, it will be necessary to reclassify the rorquals. )Tj
T*( There have been at least 11 documented cases of blue/fin hybrid adults in the )Tj

T*(fin as about the same as that between a human and a gorilla.[15] Researchers )Tj
T*(working off Fiji believe they photographed a hybrid humpback/blue whale.[16] )Tj

T*( The specific name musculus is Latin and could mean "muscle", but it can also )Tj
T*(be interpreted as "little mouse".[18]Carl Linnaeus, who named the species in )Tj
T*(his seminal Systema Naturae of 1758,[19] would have known this and may have )Tj
T*(intended the ironic double meaning.[20]Herman Melville called this species )Tj
T*(sulphur-bottom in his novel Moby-Dick due to an orange-brown or yellow tinge on )Tj
T*(the underparts from diatom films on the skin. Other common names for the blue )Tj
T*(whale have included Sibbald's rorqual \(after Sibbald, who first described the )Tj

T*(now fallen into disuse. The first known usage of the term blue whale was in )Tj

T*(specifically attribute it to the species in question. The name was really )Tj
T*(derived from the Norwegian bl√•hval, coined by Svend Foyn shortly after he had )Tj
T*(perfected the harpoon gun; the Norwegian scientist G. O. Sars adopted it as the )Tj
T*(Norwegian common name in 1874.[17] )Tj
T*( Authorities classify the species into three or four subspecies: B. m. )Tj
T*(musculus, the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North )Tj
T*(Pacific populations, B. m. intermedia, the southern blue whale of the Southern )Tj
T*(Ocean, B. m. brevicauda, the pygmy blue whale found in the Indian Ocean and )Tj

T*(rorqual, which is also found in the Indian Ocean and, although described )Tj
T*(earlier, may be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda.[1] )Tj
T*( Description and behaviour )Tj
T*( The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison )Tj
T*(with the stockier build of other whales.[22] The head is flat, U-shaped and has )Tj
T*(a prominent ridge running from the blowhole to the top of the upper lip.[22] )Tj
T*(The front part of the mouth is thick with baleen plates; around 300 plates )Tj
T*(\(each around one metre \(3.2¬†ft\) long\)[22] hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5¬†)Tj
T*(m \(1.6¬†ft\) back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves \(called ventral )Tj
T*(pleats\) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist )Tj
T*(with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding \(see feeding below\). )Tj
T*( The dorsal fin is small,[22] ranging in height from 8‚Äì70 centimeters \(3.1‚Äì28¬†)Tj
T*(in\) \(usually 20‚Äì40 centimeters \(7.9‚Äì16¬†in\)\) and averaging about 28 centimetres )Tj
T*(\(11¬†in\).[23] It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located )Tj
T*(around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in )Tj
T*(shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, )Tj
T*(but others may have prominent and falcate \(sickle-shaped\) dorsals. When )Tj
T*(surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of )Tj
T*(the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei )Tj
T*(whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. )Tj
T*(Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke )Tj
T*(when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a spectacular vertical )Tj
T*(single-column spout up to 12 metres \(39¬†ft\), typically 9 metres \(30¬†ft\). Its )Tj
T*(lung capacity is 5,000 litres \(1320 U.S. gallons\). Blue whales have twin )Tj
T*(blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.[22] )Tj
T*( The flippers are 3‚Äì4 metres \(9.8‚Äì13¬†ft\) long. The upper sides are grey with a )Tj
T*(thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are )Tj
T*(generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, )Tj
T*(are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from )Tj
T*(individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others )Tj
T*(demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all )Tj
T*(tightly mottled.[3] )Tj
T*( Blue whales can reach speeds of 50 kilometres per hour \(31¬†mph\) over short )Tj
T*(bursts, usually when interacting with other whales, but 20 kilometres per hour )Tj
T*(\(12¬†mph\) is a more typical traveling speed.[3] When feeding, they slow down to )Tj
T*(5 kilometres per hour \(3.1¬†mph\). )Tj
T*( Blue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not )Tj
T*(known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a )Tj

T*(known dinosaur of the Mesozoic Era was Argentinosaurus,[24] which is estimated )Tj
T*(to have weighed up to 90 metric tons \(99¬†short tons\). )Tj
T*( Blue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. As is the case with )Tj
T*(most large whales targeted by whalers, adult blue whales have never been )Tj
T*(weighed whole, but cut up into manageable pieces first. This caused an )Tj
T*(underestimate of the total weight of the whale, due to the loss of blood and )Tj
T*(other fluids. Nevertheless, measurements between 150‚Äì170 metric tons \(170‚Äì190 )Tj
T*(short tons\) were recorded of animals up to 27 metres \(89¬†ft\) in length. The )Tj
T*(weight of an individual 30 metres \(98¬†ft\) long is believed by the American )Tj
T*(National Marine Mammal Laboratory \(NMML\) to be in excess of 180 metric tons )Tj
T*(\(200¬†short tons\). The largest blue whale accurately weighed by NMML scientists )Tj
T*(to date was a female that weighed 177 metric tons \(195¬†short tons\).[9] As a )Tj
T*(whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific appear to be smaller )Tj
T*(on average than those from sub-Antarctic waters. )Tj
T*( There is some uncertainty about the biggest blue whale ever found, as most )Tj
T*(data came from blue whales killed in Antarctic waters during the first half of )Tj
T*(the twentieth century, and was collected by whalers not well-versed in standard )Tj
T*(zoological measurement techniques. The heaviest whale ever recorded weighed in )Tj
T*(at 190 metric tons \(210¬†short tons\).[25] The longest whales ever recorded were )Tj
T*(two females measuring 33.6 metres \(110¬†ft\) and 33.3 metres \(109¬†ft\), although )Tj
T*(in neither of these cases was the piecemeal weight gathered.[26] The longest )Tj
T*(whale measured by scientists at the NMML was a 29.9 metres \(98¬†ft\),[9] female )Tj
T*(caught in the Antarctic by Japanese whalers in 1946‚Äì47. Lieut. Quentin R. )Tj
T*(Walsh, USCG, while acting as whaling inspector of the factory ship Ulysses, )Tj
T*(verified the measurement of a 30 m \(98 ft\) pregnant blue whale caught in the )Tj
T*(Antarctic in the 1937‚Äì38 season.[27] The longest reported in the North Pacific )Tj
T*(was a 27.1 metres \(89¬†ft\) female taken by Japanese whalers in 1959, and the )Tj
T*(longest reported in the North Atlantic was a 28.1 metres \(92¬†ft\) female caught )Tj
T*(in the Davis Strait.[17] )Tj
T*( Due to its large size, several organs of the blue whale are the largest in the )Tj
T*(animal kingdom. A blue whale's tongue weighs around 2.7 metric tons \(3.0¬†short )Tj
T*(tons\)[28] and, when fully expanded, its mouth is large enough to hold up to 90 )Tj
T*(metric tons \(99¬†short tons\) of food and water.[8] Despite the size of its )Tj
T*(mouth, the dimensions of its throat are such that a blue whale cannot swallow )Tj
T*(an object wider than a beach ball.[29] Its heart weighs 600 kilograms \(1,300¬†)Tj
T*(lb\) and is the largest known in any animal.[28] A blue whale's aorta is about )Tj
T*(23 centimetres \(9.1¬†in\) in diameter.[30] During the first seven months of its )Tj
T*(life, a blue whale calf drinks approximately 400 litres \(110¬†USgal\) of milk )Tj
T*(every day. Blue whale calves gain weight quickly, as much as 90 kilograms \(200¬†)Tj
T*(lb\) every 24 hours. Even at birth, they weigh up to 2,700 kilograms \(6,000¬†)Tj
T*(lb\)‚Äîthe same as a fully grown hippopotamus.[3] Blue whales have relatively )Tj
T*(small brains, only about 6.92 kilograms \(15.26¬†lb\) , about 0.007% of its body )Tj
T*(weight.[31] )Tj
T*( Feeding )Tj
T*( Blue whales feed almost exclusively on krill, though they also take small )Tj
T*(numbers of copepods.[32] The species of this zooplankton eaten by blue whales )Tj
T*(varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, )Tj
T*(Thysanoessa raschii, Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa longicaudata are the )Tj

T*(near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been )Tj

T*( Hunting era )Tj
T*( Blue whales are not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that )Tj
T*(they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead targeted sperm and right )Tj
T*(whales.[59] In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with )Tj
T*(harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales.[3] Although it was )Tj
T*(initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, Foyn perfected the harpoon )Tj
T*(gun, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of )Tj
T*(Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the )Tj
T*(last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904. )Tj
T*( Soon, blue whales were being hunted off Iceland \(1883\), the Faroe Islands )Tj
T*(\(1894\), Newfoundland \(1898\), and Spitsbergen \(1903\). In 1904‚Äì05 the first blue )Tj
T*(whales were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, with the advent of the stern )Tj
T*(slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch )Tj
T*(of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and )Tj
T*(sub-Antarctic began to increase dramatically. In the 1930‚Äì31 season, these )Tj
T*(ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of World War )Tj
T*(II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas )Tj
T*(restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were )Tj
T*(ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare )Tj
T*(species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative )Tj
T*(abundance. )Tj
T*( Arthur C. Clarke, in his 1962 book Profiles of the Future, was the first )Tj
T*(prominent intellectual to call attention to the plight of the blue whale. He )Tj
T*(mentioned its large brain and said, "we do not know the true nature of the )Tj
T*(entity we are destroying."[60] )Tj
T*( Blue whale hunting was banned in 1966 by the International Whaling )Tj
T*(Commission,[61][62] and illegal whaling by the USSR finally halted in the )Tj
T*(1970s,[63] by which time 330,000 blue whales had been caught in the Antarctic, )Tj
T*(33,000 in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and )Tj
T*(7,000 in the North Atlantic. The largest original population, in the Antarctic, )Tj
T*(had been reduced to 0.15% of their initial numbers.[11] )Tj
T*( Population and distribution today )Tj
T*( Since the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have failed to ascertain )Tj
T*(whether the conservation reliant global blue whale population is increasing or )Tj
T*(remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show a significant increase )Tj
T*(at 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at )Tj
T*(under 1% of their original levels.[11] It has also been suggested that )Tj
T*(Icelandic and Californian populations are increasing but these increases are )Tj
T*(not statistically significant. The total world population was estimated to be )Tj
T*(between 5,000 and 12,000 in 2002, although there are high levels of uncertainty )Tj
T*(in available estimates for many areas.[9] )Tj
T*( The IUCN Red List counts the blue whale as "endangered" as it has since the )Tj

T*( In the Southern Hemisphere, there appear to be two distinct subspecies, B. m. )Tj

T*(B. m. brevicauda, found in Indian Ocean waters. The most recent surveys )Tj
T*(\(midpoint 1998\) provided an estimate of 2,280 blue whales in the Antarctic[66] )Tj
T*(\(of which fewer than 1% are likely to be pygmy blue whales\).[67] Estimates from )Tj
T*(a 1996 survey show that 424 pygmy blue whales were in a small area south of )Tj
T*(Madagascar alone,[68] thus it is likely that numbers in the entire Indian Ocean )Tj
T*(are in the thousands. If this is true, the global numbers would be much higher )Tj
T*(than estimates predict.[10] )Tj
T*( A fourth subspecies, B. m. indica, was identified by Blyth in 1859 in the )Tj
T*(northern Indian Ocean, but difficulties in identifying distinguishing features )Tj
T*(for this subspecies led to it being used a synonym for B. m. brevicauda, the )Tj
T*(pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female )Tj
T*(adult size is closer to that of the Pygmy Blue than B. m. musculus, although )Tj
T*(the populations of B. m. indica and B. m. brevicauda appear to be discrete, and )Tj
T*(the breeding seasons differ by almost six months.[69] )Tj
T*( Migratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known. For example, pygmy )Tj
T*(blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean \(Oman, Maldives and )Tj
T*(Sri Lanka\), where they may form a distinct resident population.[69] In )Tj
T*(addition, the population of blue whales occurring off Chile and Peru may also )Tj
T*(be a distinct population. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South )Tj
T*(Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off )Tj
T*(Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean.[69] In Chile, the )Tj

T*(undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered )Tj
T*(feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of Chiloe Island in the Gulf )Tj

T*( Blue whales may be wounded, sometimes fatally, after colliding with ocean )Tj

T*( The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some )Tj
T*(may have evolved from plasmids¬†‚Äì pieces of DNA that can move between cells¬†‚Äì )Tj
T*(while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an )Tj
T*(important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic )Tj
T*(diversity.[7] Viruses are considered by some to be a life form, because they )Tj
T*(carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection. )Tj
T*(However they lack key characteristics \(such as cell structure\) that are )Tj
T*(generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but )Tj
T*(not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge )Tj
T*(of life".[8] )Tj
T*( Viruses spread in many ways; viruses in plants are often transmitted from )Tj
T*(plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; viruses in )Tj
T*(animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. These disease-bearing )Tj
T*(organisms are known as vectors. Influenza viruses are spread by coughing and )Tj
T*(sneezing. Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are )Tj
T*(transmitted by the faecal‚Äìoral route and are passed from person to person by )Tj
T*(contact, entering the body in food or water. HIV is one of several viruses )Tj
T*(transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. The range )Tj
T*(of host cells that a virus can infect is called its "host range". This can be )Tj
T*(narrow or, as when a virus is capable of infecting many species, broad.[9] )Tj
T*( Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates )Tj
T*(the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which )Tj
T*(confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. )Tj
T*(However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade )Tj
T*(these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics have no )Tj
T*(effect on viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed. )Tj
T*( Etymology )Tj
T*( The word is from the Latin virus referring to poison and other noxious )Tj
T*(substances, first used in English in 1392.[10]Virulent, from Latin virulentus )Tj
T*(\(poisonous\), dates to 1400.[11] A meaning of "agent that causes infectious )Tj
T*(disease" is first recorded in 1728,[10] before the discovery of viruses by )Tj
T*(Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. The plural is viruses. The adjective viral dates to )Tj
T*(1948.[12] The term virion \(plural virions\), which dates from 1959,[13] is also )Tj
T*(used to refer to a single, stable infective viral particle that is released )Tj
T*(from the cell and is fully capable of infecting other cells of the same )Tj
T*(type.[14] )Tj
T*( History )Tj
T*( Louis Pasteur was unable to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated )Tj
T*(about a pathogen too small to be detected using a microscope.[15] In 1884, the )Tj
T*(French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter \(known today as the )Tj
T*(Chamberland filter or Chamberland-Pasteur filter\) with pores smaller than )Tj
T*(bacteria. Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter )Tj
T*(and completely remove them from the solution.[16] In 1892, the Russian )Tj
T*(biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the )Tj
T*(tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from )Tj
T*(infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested )Tj
T*(the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but did not )Tj
T*(pursue the idea.[17] At the time it was thought that all infectious agents )Tj
T*(could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium¬†‚Äì this was part of )Tj
T*(the germ theory of disease.[2] In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus )Tj
T*(Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered )Tj
T*(solution contained a new form of infectious agent.[18] He observed that the )Tj
T*(agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did )Tj
T*(not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum )Tj
T*(\(soluble living germ\) and re-introduced the word virus.[17] Beijerinck )Tj
T*(maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by )Tj
T*(Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate.[17] In the same year )Tj
T*(Friedrich Loeffler and Frosch passed the first animal virus¬†‚Äì agent of )Tj
T*(foot-and-mouth disease \(aphthovirus\)¬†‚Äì through a similar filter.[14] )Tj

T*(The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, )Tj

T*( By the end of the 19th century, viruses were defined in terms of their )Tj
T*(infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their requirement for living )Tj
T*(hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross )Tj
T*(Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, )Tj
T*(E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia )Tj
T*(virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue.[21] In 1928, H. B. Maitland )Tj
T*(and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. )Tj
T*(Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown )Tj
T*(on a large scale for vaccine production.[22] )Tj
T*( Another breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest )Tj
T*(William Goodpasture grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilized )Tj
T*(chickens' eggs.[23] In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick )Tj
T*(Robbins grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to be )Tj
T*(grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Jonas Salk )Tj
T*(to make an effective polio vaccine.[24] )Tj
T*( The first images of viruses were obtained upon the invention of electron )Tj
T*(microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll.[25] In )Tj
T*(1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the )Tj
T*(tobacco mosaic virus and found it was mostly made of protein.[26] A short time )Tj
T*(later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts.[27] The tobacco )Tj
T*(mosaic virus was the first to be crystallised and its structure could therefore )Tj
T*(be elucidated in detail. The first X-ray diffraction pictures of the )Tj
T*(crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. On the basis )Tj
T*(of her pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full DNA structure of the )Tj
T*(virus in 1955.[28] In the same year, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams )Tj
T*(showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus RNA and its coat protein can assemble )Tj
T*(by themselves to form functional viruses, suggesting that this simple mechanism )Tj
T*(was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host )Tj
T*(cells.[29] )Tj
T*( The second half of the 20th century was the golden age of virus discovery and )Tj
T*(most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial )Tj
T*(viruses were discovered during these years.[30] In 1957, equine arterivirus and )Tj

T*(Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the key enzyme )Tj

T*(1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore.[32] In 1983 Luc )Tj
T*(Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the )Tj

T*( Origins )Tj
T*( Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since )Tj
T*(living cells first evolved.[34] The origin of viruses is unclear because they )Tj

T*(Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over )Tj
T*(time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia )Tj
T*(and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside )Tj
T*(host cells. They lend support to this hypothesis, as their dependence on )Tj
T*(parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to )Tj
T*(survive outside a cell. This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis,[38][39] )Tj
T*(or reduction hypothesis.[40])Tj
T*(Cellular origin hypothesis¬†)Tj
T*(Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the )Tj

T*(\(pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells\) or transposons \(molecules of )Tj

T*(in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950.[42] This is sometimes called the )Tj
T*(vagrancy hypothesis,[38][43] or the escape hypothesis.[40])Tj
T*( Coevolution hypothesis¬†)Tj
T*(This is also called the virus-first hypothesis[40] and proposes that viruses )Tj
T*(may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid at the same )Tj
T*(time as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular )Tj
T*(life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not )Tj
T*(classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have )Tj
T*(characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called )Tj
T*(subviral agents.[44] Viroids are important pathogens of plants.[45] They do not )Tj
T*(code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery )Tj
T*(for their replication.[46] The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA )Tj
T*(genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus )Tj
T*(and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus and )Tj

T*(the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan )Tj
T*(Acanthamoeba castellanii.[48] These viruses that are dependent on the presence )Tj
T*(of other virus species in the host cell are called satellites and may represent )Tj
T*(evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.[49][50])Tj
T*(  In the past, there were problems with all of these hypotheses: the regressive )Tj

T*(resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex )Tj
T*(capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis )Tj
T*(contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells.[40] )Tj
T*(Viruses are now recognised as ancient and to have origins that pre-date the )Tj
T*(divergence of life into the three domains.[51] This discovery has led modern )Tj
T*(virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.[51] )Tj
T*( The evidence for an ancestral world of RNA cells[52] and computer analysis of )Tj

T*(these hypotheses is correct.[52] However, it seems unlikely that all currently )Tj

T*(times in the past by one or more mechanisms.[53] )Tj
T*( Prions are infectious protein molecules that do not contain DNA or RNA.[54] )Tj
T*(They can cause infections such as scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform )Tj

T*(reaction where each prion protein converts many host proteins into more prions, )Tj
T*(and these new prions then go on to convert even more protein into prions; all )Tj
T*(known prion diseases are fatal. Although prions are fundamentally different )Tj
T*(from viruses and viroids, their discovery gives credence to the theory that )Tj

T*( Structure )Tj
T*( Viruses display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called morphologies. In )Tj
T*(general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Most viruses that have been )Tj
T*(studied have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres. Some filoviruses have a )Tj
T*(total length of up to 1400¬†nm; their diameters are only about 80¬†nm.[61] Most )Tj
T*(viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope so scanning and transmission )Tj
T*(electron microscopes are used to visualise virions.[62] To increase the )Tj
T*(contrast between viruses and the background, electron-dense "stains" are used. )Tj
T*(These are solutions of salts of heavy metals, such as tungsten, that scatter )Tj
T*(the electrons from regions covered with the stain. When virions are coated with )Tj
T*(stain \(positive staining\), fine detail is obscured. Negative staining overcomes )Tj
T*(this problem by staining the background only.[63] )Tj
T*( A complete virus particle, known as a virion, consists of nucleic acid )Tj
T*(surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. These are formed )Tj
T*(from identical protein subunits called capsomeres.[64] Viruses can have a lipid )Tj
T*("envelope" derived from the host cell membrane. The capsid is made from )Tj
T*(proteins encoded by the viral genome and its shape serves as the basis for )Tj
T*(morphological distinction.[65][66] Virally coded protein subunits will )Tj
T*(self-assemble to form a capsid, in general requiring the presence of the virus )Tj
T*(genome. Complex viruses code for proteins that assist in the construction of )Tj
T*(their capsid. Proteins associated with nucleic acid are known as )Tj
T*(nucleoproteins, and the association of viral capsid proteins with viral nucleic )Tj
T*(acid is called a nucleocapsid. The capsid and entire virus structure can be )Tj
T*(mechanically \(physically\) probed through atomic force microscopy.[67][68] In )Tj
T*(general, there are four main morphological virus types: )Tj
T*( Helical)Tj
T*(These viruses are composed of a single type of capsomer stacked around a )Tj
T*(central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or )Tj
T*(hollow tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: )Tj
T*(These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic )Tj
T*(material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound )Tj
T*(into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic )Tj
T*(acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical )Tj
T*(capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the )Tj
T*(diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomers. The )Tj
T*(well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.[69])Tj

T*( Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific )Tj
T*(receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host )Tj
T*(range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. )Tj
T*(This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 )Tj
T*(molecule¬†‚Äì a chemokine receptor¬†‚Äì which is most commonly found on the surface )Tj
T*(of CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect )Tj
T*(only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor )Tj
T*(can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the )Tj
T*(fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus )Tj
T*(surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.)Tj
T*(Penetration follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through )Tj
T*(receptor-mediated endocytosis or membrane fusion. This is often called viral )Tj
T*(entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal )Tj
T*(cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of )Tj
T*(chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the )Tj
T*(cell wall.[91] However, nearly all plant viruses \(such as tobacco mosaic virus\) )Tj
T*(can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded )Tj
T*(nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata.[92] Bacteria, like )Tj
T*(plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. )Tj
T*(However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell )Tj
T*(walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that )Tj
T*(inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the )Tj
T*(viral capsid remains outside.[93])Tj
T*(Uncoating is a process in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by )Tj
T*(degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the )Tj
T*(end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid.)Tj
T*(Replication of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome. )Tj
T*(Replication involves synthesis of viral messenger RNA \(mRNA\) from "early" genes )Tj

T*(  The genetic material within virus particles, and the method by which the )Tj
T*(material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses. )Tj
T*( DNA viruses¬†)Tj
T*(The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell's nucleus. )Tj
T*(If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter )Tj
T*(the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane \(e.g., )Tj
T*(herpesviruses\) or¬†‚Äì more usually¬†‚Äì by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA )Tj
T*(viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising )Tj
T*(machinery, and RNA processing machinery; however, viruses with larger genomes )Tj
T*(may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome )Tj
T*(must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in )Tj
T*(bacteria it need only enter the cell.[98])Tj
T*( RNA viruses)Tj
T*(Replication usually takes place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed )Tj
T*(into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The )Tj
T*(polarity \(whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins\) )Tj
T*(of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; )Tj
T*(the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or )Tj
T*(double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create )Tj
T*(copies of their genomes.[99])Tj
T*( Reverse transcribing viruses)Tj
T*(These have ssRNA \(Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae\) or dsDNA )Tj
T*(\(Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae\) in their particles. Reverse transcribing )Tj
T*(viruses with RNA genomes \(retroviruses\), use a DNA intermediate to replicate, )Tj
T*(whereas those with DNA genomes \(pararetroviruses\) use an RNA intermediate )Tj
T*(during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or )Tj
T*(RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. )Tj
T*(Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host )Tj
T*(genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do )Tj
T*(not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can )Tj
T*(give rise to infectious virus.[100] They are susceptible to antiviral drugs )Tj
T*(that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. )Tj
T*(An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the )Tj
T*(second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.[101])Tj
T*( Effects on the host cell )Tj
T*( The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host )Tj
T*(cell is extensive.[102] These are called cytopathic effects.[103] Most virus )Tj
T*(infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death )Tj
T*(include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and )Tj
T*(apoptosis.[104] Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal )Tj
T*(activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which )Tj
T*(are components of the virus particle.[105] )Tj
T*( Some viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell. Cells in which )Tj
T*(the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function )Tj
T*(normally.[106] This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant )Tj
T*(for many months or years. This is often the case with herpes viruses.[107][108] )Tj

T*(life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi.[3] However, different types )Tj
T*(of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are )Tj

T*(humans.[114] The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single )Tj

T*(infections by a method called phage typing.[115] )Tj
T*( Classification )Tj
T*( Classification seeks to describe the diversity of viruses by naming and )Tj
T*(grouping them on the basis of similarities. In 1962, Andr√© Lwoff, Robert Horne, )Tj
T*(and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, )Tj
T*(based on the Linnaean hierarchical system.[116] This system bases )Tj
T*(classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses )Tj
T*(were grouped according to their shared properties \(not those of their hosts\) )Tj
T*(and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes.[117] Later the )Tj
T*(International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are )Tj
T*(not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and )Tj
T*(high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond )Tj
T*(Order. As such, the Baltimore Classification is used to supplement the more )Tj
T*(traditional hierarchy. )Tj
T*( ICTV classification )Tj
T*( The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses \(ICTV\) developed the )Tj
T*(current classification system and wrote guidelines that put a greater weight on )Tj
T*(certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy \(a )Tj
T*(universal system for classifying viruses\) has been established. The 7th lCTV )Tj
T*(Report formalised for the first time the concept of the virus species as the )Tj
T*(lowest taxon \(group\) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa.[118] However, at )Tj
T*(present only a small part of the total diversity of viruses has been studied, )Tj
T*(with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus )Tj
T*(sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the )Tj
T*(environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large )Tj
T*(majority of sequences are completely novel.[119] )Tj
T*( The general taxonomic structure is as follows: )Tj
T*( Order \(-virales\))Tj
T*(Family \(-viridae\))Tj
T*(Subfamily \(-virinae\))Tj
T*(Genus \(-virus\))Tj
T*(Species \(-virus\))Tj
T*(  In the current \(2011\) ICTV taxonomy, six orders have been established, the )Tj
T*(Caudovirales, Herpesvirales, Mononegavirales, Nidovirales, Picornavirales and )Tj
T*(Tymovirales. A seventh order Ligamenvirales has also been proposed. The )Tj
T*(committee does not formally distinguish between subspecies, strains, and )Tj
T*(isolates. In total there are 6 orders, 87 families, 19 subfamilies, 349 genera, )Tj
T*(about 2,284 species and over 3,000 types yet unclassified.[120][121][122] )Tj
T*( Baltimore classification )Tj
T*( The Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore devised the Baltimore )Tj

T*(conjunction with the Baltimore classification system in modern virus )Tj

T*( As an example of viral classification, the chicken pox virus, varicella zoster )Tj
T*(\(VZV\), belongs to the order Herpesvirales, family Herpesviridae, subfamily )Tj
T*(Alphaherpesvirinae, and genus Varicellovirus. VZV is in Group I of the )Tj
T*(Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use reverse )Tj
T*(transcriptase. )Tj
T*( Role in human disease )Tj
T*( Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, )Tj
T*(influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious diseases such as ebola, )Tj
T*(AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of )Tj
T*(viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence. Other diseases are )Tj
T*(under investigation as to whether they too have a virus as the causative agent, )Tj
T*(such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 \(HHV6\) and )Tj
T*(neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue )Tj
T*(syndrome.[129] There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously )Tj
T*(thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for )Tj
T*(psychiatric illnesses in humans.[130] )Tj
T*( Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an )Tj
T*(organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the )Tj
T*(cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent )Tj
T*(death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole )Tj
T*(organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of )Tj
T*(healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly )Tj
T*(within an organism. An example would include the ability of the herpes simplex )Tj
T*(virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human )Tj
T*(body. This is called latency[131] and is a characteristic of the herpes )Tj
T*(viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and )Tj
T*(varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have )Tj
T*(been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus.[132] However, )Tj
T*(these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the )Tj
T*(virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia )Tj
T*(pestis.[133] )Tj
T*( Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections, where the viruses )Tj
T*(continue to replicate in the body despite the host's defense mechanisms.[134] )Tj
T*(This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections. People )Tj
T*(chronically infected are known as carriers, as they serve as reservoirs of )Tj
T*(infectious virus.[135] In populations with a high proportion of carriers, the )Tj
T*(disease is said to be endemic.[136] )Tj
T*( Epidemiology )Tj
T*( Viral epidemiology is the branch of medical science that deals with the )Tj
T*(transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses )Tj
T*(can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means )Tj
T*(from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B )Tj
T*(virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus.[137] )Tj
T*(Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although )Tj
T*(causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and )Tj
T*(newborn baby.[138] )Tj
T*( Horizontal transmission is the most common mechanism of spread of viruses in )Tj
T*(populations. Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during )Tj
T*(sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or )Tj
T*(needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., )Tj
T*(Epstein-Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; )Tj
T*(aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect )Tj
T*(vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host, e.g., dengue. The rate )Tj
T*(or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include )Tj
T*(population density, the number of susceptible individuals, \(i.e., those not )Tj
T*(immune\),[139] the quality of healthcare and the weather.[140] )Tj
T*( Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during )Tj

T*(the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands )Tj
T*(of cattle were slaughtered.[143] Most viral infections of humans and other )Tj
T*(animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or )Tj
T*(symptoms.[144] Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to )Tj
T*(weeks, but are known for most infections.[145] Somewhat overlapping, but mainly )Tj
T*(following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability ‚Äî a time )Tj
T*(when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another )Tj
T*(person or animal.[145] This, too, is known for many viral infections, and )Tj
T*(knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of )Tj
T*(outbreaks.[146] When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a )Tj
T*(population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks )Tj
T*(spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.[147] )Tj
T*( Epidemics and pandemics )Tj
T*( Native American populations were devastated by contagious diseases, in )Tj
T*(particular, smallpox, brought to the Americas by European colonists. It is )Tj
T*(unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the )Tj
T*(arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated to be )Tj
T*(close to 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease )Tj
T*(significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native )Tj
T*(population.[148] )Tj
T*( A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until )Tj
T*(1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and )Tj
T*(deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in )Tj
T*(contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, )Tj
T*(elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients.[149] Older estimates say it killed )Tj
T*(40‚Äì50¬†million people,[150] while more recent research suggests that it may have )Tj

T*(1918.[151] )Tj
T*( Most researchers believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the )Tj
T*(20th century;[152] it is now a pandemic, with an estimated 38.6 million people )Tj
T*(now living with the disease worldwide.[153] The Joint United Nations Programme )Tj
T*(on HIV/AIDS \(UNAIDS\) and the World Health Organization \(WHO\) estimate that AIDS )Tj
T*(has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognised on June 5, )Tj
T*(1981, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.[154] )Tj
T*(In 2007 there were 2.7 million new HIV infections and 2 million HIV-related )Tj
T*(deaths.[155] )Tj
T*( Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the Filoviridae. )Tj
T*(Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, and )Tj
T*(include the ebola and marburg viruses. The Marburg virus attracted widespread )Tj
T*(press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. Beginning in October )Tj

T*( Host defence mechanisms )Tj
T*( The body's first line of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. )Tj
T*(This comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection )Tj
T*(in a non-specific manner. This means that the cells of the innate system )Tj
T*(recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the adaptive )Tj
T*(immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the )Tj
T*(host.[166] )Tj
T*( RNA interference is an important innate defence against viruses.[167] Many )Tj
T*(viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA \(dsRNA\). )Tj
T*(When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, )Tj
T*(which immediately bind to a protein complex called dicer that cuts the RNA into )Tj
T*(smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway called the RISC complex is activated, )Tj
T*(which degrades the viral mRNA and the cell survives the infection. Rotaviruses )Tj
T*(avoid this mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell and by releasing )Tj
T*(newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. The genomic )Tj
T*(dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion.[168][169] )Tj
T*( When the adaptive immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it )Tj
T*(produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it )Tj
T*(non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are )Tj
T*(important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralizing viruses )Tj
T*(but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks. The )Tj
T*(second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood )Tj
T*(of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an )Tj
T*(infection sometime in the past.[170] IgG antibody is measured when tests for )Tj
T*(immunity are carried out.[171] )Tj
T*( Antibodies can continue to be an effective defence mechanism even after )Tj
T*(viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in )Tj
T*(cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies on the surface of the virus )Tj
T*(particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of )Tj
T*(the cell's proteosome system.[172] )Tj
T*( A second defence of vertebrates against viruses is called cell-mediated )Tj
T*(immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells )Tj
T*(constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, )Tj
T*(and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is )Tj
T*(destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells )Tj
T*(such as the macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation.[173] The )Tj
T*(production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a )Tj
T*(hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is )Tj
T*(complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the )Tj
T*(infected cell and its close neighbours.[174] )Tj
T*( Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way. HIV )Tj
T*(evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the )Tj
T*(proteins on the surface of the virion. These persistent viruses evade immune )Tj
T*(control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine )Tj
T*(resistance, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, )Tj
T*(and antigenic shift.[175] Other viruses, called neurotropic viruses, are )Tj
T*(disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach )Tj

T*(host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases )Tj
T*(are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that )Tj
T*(selectively interfere with viral replication. )Tj
T*( Vaccines )Tj
T*( Vaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses. )Tj
T*(Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the )Tj
T*(actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity )Tj
T*(\(illness\) and mortality \(death\) associated with viral infections such as polio, )Tj
T*(measles, mumps and rubella.[176] Smallpox infections have been eradicated.[177] )Tj
T*(Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of )Tj
T*(humans,[178] and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals.[179] )Tj
T*(Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins )Tj
T*(\(antigens\).[180] Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do )Tj
T*(not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are )Tj
T*(called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a )Tj
T*(weak immunity, \(who are described as immunocompromised\), because in these )Tj
T*(people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease.[181] Biotechnology )Tj
T*(and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These )Tj
T*(vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an )Tj
T*(example of this type of vaccine.[182] Subunit vaccines are safe for )Tj
T*(immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease.[183] The )Tj
T*(yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably )Tj
T*(the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.[184] )Tj
T*( Antiviral drugs )Tj
T*( Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, \(fake DNA building-blocks\), )Tj
T*(which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication. The )Tj
T*(life-cycle of the virus is then halted because the newly synthesised DNA is )Tj
T*(inactive. This is because these analogues lack the hydroxyl groups, which, )Tj
T*(along with phosphorus atoms, link together to form the strong "backbone" of the )Tj
T*(DNA molecule. This is called DNA chain termination.[185] Examples of nucleoside )Tj
T*(analogues are aciclovir for Herpes simplex virus infections and lamivudine for )Tj
T*(HIV and Hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most )Tj
T*(frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.[186] Other antiviral drugs in use target )Tj
T*(different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on a proteolytic )Tj
T*(enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for it to become fully infectious. There is a )Tj
T*(large class of drugs called protease inhibitors that inactivate this enzyme. )Tj
T*( Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease )Tj
T*(is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected for the remainder of their )Tj
T*(lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside )Tj
T*(analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon.[187] The treatment of chronic )Tj
T*(carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine )Tj
T*(has been developed.[188] )Tj
T*( Infection in other species )Tj
T*( Viruses infect all cellular life and, although viruses occur universally, each )Tj
T*(cellular species has its own specific range that often infect only that )Tj
T*(species.[189] Some viruses, called satellites, can replicate only within cells )Tj
T*(that have already been infected by another virus.[48] Viruses are important )Tj
T*(pathogens of livestock. Diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue )Tj
T*(are caused by viruses.[190] Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, )Tj
T*(if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. Canine )Tj
T*(parvovirus is caused by a small DNA virus and infections are often fatal in )Tj
T*(pups.[191] Like all invertebrates, the honey bee is susceptible to many viral )Tj
T*(infections.[192] However, most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and )Tj
T*(cause no signs or symptoms of disease.[2] )Tj
T*( Plant viruses )Tj
T*( Main article: Plant virus )Tj
T*( There are many types of plant virus, but often they cause only a loss of )Tj
T*(yield, and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses )Tj

T*(gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of )Tj
T*(cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided )Tj
T*(eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.[195] RNA )Tj
T*(interference is also an effective defence in plants.[196] When they are )Tj
T*(infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as )Tj
T*(salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.[197] )Tj
T*( Plant virus particles or virus-like particles \(VLPs\) have applications in both )Tj
T*(biotechnology and nanotechnology. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple )Tj
T*(and robust structures and can be produced in large quantities either by the )Tj
T*(infection of plants or by expression in a variety of heterologous systems. )Tj
T*(Plant virus particles can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate )Tj
T*(foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use )Tj
T*(in biotechnology.[198] )Tj
T*( Bacteria )Tj
T*( Main article: Bacteriophage )Tj
T*( Bacteriophages are a common and diverse group of viruses and are the most )Tj
T*(abundant form of biological entity in aquatic environments¬†‚Äì there are up to )Tj
T*(ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria,[199] )Tj
T*(reaching levels of 250,000,000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater.[200] )Tj
T*(These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules )Tj
T*(and then entering the cell. Within a short amount of time, in some cases just )Tj
T*(minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These )Tj
T*(proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, )Tj
T*(which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral )Tj
T*(enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, in the case of the T4 )Tj
T*(phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages )Tj
T*(could be released.[201] )Tj
T*( The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing )Tj
T*(enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction )Tj
T*(endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial )Tj
T*(cells.[202] Bacteria also contain a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain )Tj
T*(fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have come into contact )Tj
T*(with in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a )Tj
T*(form of RNA interference.[203][204] This genetic system provides bacteria with )Tj
T*(acquired immunity to infection. )Tj
T*( Archaea )Tj
T*( Some viruses replicate within archaea: these are double-stranded DNA viruses )Tj
T*(with unusual and sometimes unique shapes.[5][77] These viruses have been )Tj
T*(studied in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders )Tj
T*(Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales.[205] Defences against these viruses may )Tj
T*(involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes )Tj
T*(that are related to the genes of the viruses.[206][207] )Tj
T*( Role in aquatic ecosystems )Tj
T*( A teaspoon of seawater contains about one million viruses.[208] They are )Tj
T*(essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems.[209] Most )Tj
T*(of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. )Tj
T*(They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, )Tj
T*(comprising the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine )Tj
T*(environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the )Tj
T*(viruses stimulates fresh bacterial and algal growth.[210] )Tj
T*( Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea. It is )Tj
T*(estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that )Tj

T*(archaea. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of )Tj
T*(harmful algal blooms,[211] which often kill other marine life.[212] The number )Tj
T*(of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, )Tj
T*(where there are fewer host organisms.[213] )Tj
T*( The effects of marine viruses are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of )Tj
T*(photosynthesis in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing )Tj
T*(the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of )Tj
T*(carbon per year.[213] )Tj
T*( Like any organism, marine mammals are susceptible to viral infections. In 1988 )Tj
T*(and 2002, thousands of harbor seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper )Tj
T*(virus.[214] Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, )Tj
T*(adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations.[213] )Tj
T*( Role in evolution )Tj
T*( Viruses are an important natural means of transferring genes between different )Tj
T*(species, which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution.[7] It is )Tj
T*(thought that viruses played a central role in the early evolution, before the )Tj
T*(diversification of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and at the time of the last )Tj
T*(universal common ancestor of life on Earth.[215] Viruses are still one of the )Tj
T*(largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth.[213] )Tj
T*( Applications )Tj
T*( Life sciences and medicine )Tj
T*( Viruses are important to the study of molecular and cell biology as they )Tj
T*(provide simple systems that can be used to manipulate and investigate the )Tj
T*(functions of cells.[216] The study and use of viruses have provided valuable )Tj
T*(information about aspects of cell biology.[217] For example, viruses have been )Tj
T*(useful in the study of genetics and helped our understanding of the basic )Tj
T*(mechanisms of molecular genetics, such as DNA replication, transcription, RNA )Tj
T*(processing, translation, protein transport, and immunology. )Tj
T*( Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that )Tj
T*(they are studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign )Tj
T*(substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In )Tj
T*(similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, )Tj
T*(as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use in the )Tj
T*(treatment of cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used )Tj
T*(phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in )Tj
T*(this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance )Tj
T*(now found in some pathogenic bacteria.[218] Expression of heterologous proteins )Tj
T*(by viruses is the basis of several manufacturing processes that are currently )Tj
T*(being used for the production of various proteins such as vaccine antigens and )Tj
T*(antibodies. Industrial processes have been recently developed using viral )Tj
T*(vectors and a number of pharmaceutical proteins are currently in pre-clinical )Tj
T*(and clinical trials.[219] )Tj
T*( Materials science and nanotechnology )Tj
T*( Current trends in nanotechnology promise to make much more versatile use of )Tj
T*(viruses. From the viewpoint of a materials scientist, viruses can be regarded )Tj
T*(as organic nanoparticles. Their surface carries specific tools designed to )Tj
T*(cross the barriers of their host cells. The size and shape of viruses, and the )Tj
T*(number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely )Tj
T*(defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds )Tj
T*(for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is )Tj
T*(that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques )Tj
T*(developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches )Tj
T*(towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology )Tj
T*(and medicine.[220] )Tj
T*( Because of their size, shape, and well-defined chemical structures, viruses )Tj
T*(have been used as templates for organizing materials on the nanoscale. Recent )Tj
T*(examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., )Tj
T*(using Cowpea Mosaic Virus \(CPMV\) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray )Tj
T*(based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the )Tj
T*(fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of )Tj

T*(of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.[222] )Tj
T*( Synthetic viruses )Tj
T*( Many viruses can be synthesized de novo \("from scratch"\) and the first )Tj
T*(synthetic virus was created in 2002.[223] Although somewhat of a misconception, )Tj
T*(it is not the actual virus that is synthesized, but rather its DNA genome \(in )Tj
T*(case of a DNA virus\), or a cDNA copy of its genome \(in case of RNA viruses\). )Tj
T*(For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA \(once enzymatically )Tj
T*(converted back from the synthetic cDNA\) is infectious when introduced into a )Tj
T*(cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new )Tj
T*(viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine )Tj
T*(strategies.[224] The ability to synthesize viruses has far-reaching )Tj
T*(consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as )Tj
T*(the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are )Tj
T*(available. Currently, the full-length genome sequences of 2408 different )Tj
T*(viruses \(including smallpox\) are publicly available at an online database, )Tj
T*(maintained by the National Institutes of Health.[225] )Tj
T*( Weapons )Tj
T*( The ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has )Tj
T*(led to the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. )Tj
T*(Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 )Tj
T*(influenza virus in a laboratory.[226] The smallpox virus devastated numerous )Tj
T*(societies throughout history before its eradication. There are officially only )Tj
T*(two centers in the world that keep stocks of smallpox virus¬†‚Äì the Russian )Tj
T*(Vector laboratory, and the United States Centers for Disease Control.[227] But )Tj
T*(fears that it may be used as a weapon are not totally unfounded;[227] the )Tj
T*(vaccine for smallpox has sometimes severe side-effects¬†‚Äì during the last years )Tj
T*(before the eradication of smallpox disease more people became seriously ill as )Tj
T*(a result of vaccination than did people from smallpox[228]¬†‚Äì and smallpox )Tj
T*(vaccination is no longer universally practiced.[229] Thus, much of the modern )Tj
T*(human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox.[227] )Tj

T*( The Shackleton‚ÄìRowett Expedition \(1921‚Äì22\) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last )Tj
T*(Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic )Tj
T*(Exploration. The venture, financed by businessman John Quiller Rowett, is )Tj
T*(sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted )Tj
T*(Norwegian sealer. Shackleton's original plan had been to explore the Beaufort )Tj
T*(Sea sector of the Arctic Ocean, but this was abandoned after the Canadian )Tj
T*(government withheld financial support. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic )Tj
T*(exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was )Tj
T*(delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before )Tj
T*(the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died aboard ship, just )Tj
T*(after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. )Tj
T*( The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month )Tj
T*(cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of second-in-command )Tj
T*(Frank Wild. In these waters the shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: )Tj
T*(slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a )Tj
T*(steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20¬∞E, well )Tj
T*(short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power was insufficient for )Tj
T*(it to penetrate far into the Antarctic ice. Following several fruitless )Tj
T*(attempts to break southwards through the pack ice, Wild returned the ship to )Tj
T*(South Georgia, after a nostalgic visit to Elephant Island, where he and 21 )Tj
T*(others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during )Tj
T*(Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier. )Tj
T*( Wild had thoughts of a second, more productive season in the ice, and took the )Tj
T*(ship to Cape Town for a refit. Here he received a message from Rowett ordering )Tj
T*(the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. Although not greatly )Tj
T*(regarded in the histories of polar exploration, the Quest voyage's significance )Tj
T*(is its standing at the very end of the Heroic Age and the beginning of the )Tj
T*("Mechanical Age" that followed. Ultimately, however, the event that defined it )Tj
T*(in public memory, and overshadowed all its activities, was Shackleton's )Tj
T*(untimely death. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( [edit] After the Endurance )Tj
T*( After helping to rescue the various stranded groups of men from his Endurance )Tj
T*(expedition, Shackleton came home to Britain in late May 1917, while World War I )Tj
T*(was raging. Too old to enlist, he nevertheless sought an active role in the war )Tj
T*(effort,[1] and eventually departed for Murmansk with the temporary army rank of )Tj
T*(major, as part of a military mission to North Russia. This role was not )Tj
T*(satisfying to Shackleton, and he expressed his dissatisfaction in letters home: )Tj
T*("I feel I am no use to anyone unless I am outfacing the storm in wild )Tj
T*(lands."[2] He returned to England in February 1919 and began plans to set up a )Tj
T*(company that would, with the cooperation of the North Russian Government, )Tj
T*(develop the natural resources of the region.[3] This scheme came to nothing, as )Tj
T*(the Red Army took control of that part of Russia during the Russian Civil War, )Tj
T*(and Shackleton was forced to rely on the lecture circuit to provide him with an )Tj
T*(income. At the Philharmonic Hall in Great Portland Street, London, during the )Tj
T*(winter of 1919‚Äì20, he lectured twice a day, six days a week, for five )Tj
T*(months.[4] At the same time, despite the large debts still outstanding from the )Tj
T*(Endurance expedition, he began planning a new exploration venture.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Canadian proposal )Tj
T*( Shackleton had decided to turn away from the Antarctic, go northwards, and )Tj

T*(records, that the sea held large undiscovered land masses that "would be of the )Tj
T*(greatest scientific interest to the world, apart from the possible economic )Tj
T*(value".[5] He also hoped to reach the northern "pole of inaccessibility", the )Tj
T*(most remote point in the Arctic regions.[6] In March 1920, his plans received )Tj
T*(the general approval of the Royal Geographical Society \(RGS\) and were supported )Tj
T*(by the Canadian government. On this basis Shackleton set about acquiring the )Tj
T*(necessary funding, which he estimated at ¬£50,000 \(about ¬£1.6¬†million, 2008 )Tj
T*(value\).[5][7] Later that year, Shackleton met by chance an old school-friend, )Tj
T*(John Quiller Rowett, who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to enable )Tj
T*(Shackleton to get started. With this money Shackleton was able, in January )Tj
T*(1921, to acquire the wooden Norwegian whaler Foca I, and to proceed with the )Tj
T*(purchase of other equipment and the hiring of a crew.[5] )Tj
T*( In May 1921 the Canadian plans were abandoned. The policy of the government of )Tj
T*(Canada on the funding of expeditions changed with the advent of a new Prime )Tj
T*(Minister, Arthur Meighen, who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal .[8] )Tj
T*(Shackleton's response was not to cancel the expedition but to reorient it. In )Tj
T*(the middle of May his associate Alexander Macklin, who was in Canada )Tj
T*(negotiating the purchase of dogs, received a telegram notifying him that the )Tj
T*(destination was now to be the Antarctic; a varied programme of exploration, )Tj
T*(coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in southern )Tj
T*(waters had been substituted for the Beaufort Sea venture.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Antarctic preparation )Tj
T*( [edit] Objectives )Tj
T*( Even before his impasse with the Canadian government, Shackleton had been )Tj
T*(considering a southern expedition as a possible alternative to the Beaufort )Tj
T*(Sea. According to RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill, as early as March 1920 )Tj
T*(Shackleton had talked about two possible schemes‚Äîthe Beaufort Sea exploration )Tj
T*(and "an oceanographical expedition with the object of visiting all the )Tj
T*(little-known islands of the South Atlantic and South Pacific".[9] By June 1921, )Tj
T*(it had expanded to include a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and )Tj
T*(the mapping of around 2,000¬†miles \(3,200¬†km\) of uncharted coastline. It would )Tj
T*(also encompass a search for "lost" or wrongly charted sub-Antarctic islands )Tj
T*(\(including Dougherty Island, Tuanaki, and the Nimrod Islands\),[10][11] )Tj
T*(investigations of possible mineral resources to be exploited in these )Tj
T*(rediscovered lands, and an ambitious scientific research program.[12] This was )Tj
T*(to include soundings around Gough Island to investigate an alleged "underwater )Tj
T*(continental connection between Africa and America."[13] Shackleton biographer )Tj
T*(Margery Fisher calls the plan "diffuse", and "far too comprehensive for one )Tj
T*(small body of men to tackle within two years".[12] According to biographer )Tj
T*(Roland Huntford the expedition had no obvious goal and was "only too clearly a )Tj
T*(piece of improvisation, a pretext [for Shackleton] to get away".[14] )Tj
T*( Fisher describes the expedition as representing "the dividing line between )Tj
T*(what has become known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration and the )Tj
T*(Mechanical Age".[12] Shackleton called the voyage "pioneering", referring )Tj
T*(specifically to the aeroplane that was taken \(but ultimately not used\) on the )Tj
T*(expedition.[12] In fact this was only one of the technological "firsts" that )Tj
T*(marked the venture; there were gadgets in profusion. The ship's crow's nest was )Tj
T*(electrically heated; there were heated overalls for the lookouts, a wireless )Tj
T*(set, and a device called an odograph which could trace and chart the ship's )Tj
T*(route automatically.[12] Photography was to figure prominently, and "a large )Tj
T*(and expensive outfit of cameras, cinematographical machines and general )Tj
T*(photographic appliances [was] acquired".[15] Among the oceanographical research )Tj
T*(equipment was a Lucas deep-sea sounding machine.[16] )Tj
T*( This ample provision arose from the sponsorship of Rowett, who had extended )Tj
T*(his original gift of seed money to an undertaking to cover the costs of the )Tj
T*(entire expedition.[17] The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in )Tj
T*(an \(undated\) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated )Tj
T*(the total cost as "about ¬£100,000".[12] Whatever the total, Rowett appears to )Tj
T*(have funded the lion's share, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique )Tj

T*(outstanding debt.[18][19] According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the )Tj
T*(expedition would have been impossible: "His generous attitude is the more )Tj
T*(remarkable in that he knew there was no prospect of financial return, and what )Tj
T*(he did was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with )Tj
T*(Shackleton."[20] His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the )Tj
T*(title of the expedition.[17] Rowett was, according to Huntford, "a stodgy, )Tj
T*(prosaic looking" businessman,[21] who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal )Tj
T*(contributor to an animal nutrition research institute in Aberdeen known as the )Tj
T*(Rowett Research Institute \(now part of the University of Aberdeen\). He had also )Tj
T*(endowed dental research work at the Middlesex Hospital.[21] Rowett did not live )Tj
T*(long after the return of the expedition; in 1924, aged 50, he took his own life )Tj
T*(following an apparent downturn in his business fortunes.[22] )Tj
T*( In March 1921, Shackleton renamed his expedition vessel Quest.[14] She was a )Tj
T*(small ship, 125¬†tons according to Huntford, with sail and auxiliary engine )Tj
T*(power purportedly capable of making eight knots, but in fact rarely making more )Tj
T*(than five-and-a-half.[23][24] Huntford describes her as "straight-stemmed", )Tj
T*(with an awkward square rig, and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas.[14] Fisher )Tj
T*(reports that she was built in 1917, weighed 204¬†tons, and had a large and )Tj
T*(spacious deck.[23][25] Although she had some modern facilities, such as )Tj
T*(electric lights in the cabins,[26] she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages; )Tj
T*(Shackleton, on the first day out, observed that "in no way are we shipshape or )Tj
T*(fitted to ignore even the mildest storm".[27] Leif Mills, in his biography of )Tj
T*(Frank Wild, says that had the ship been taken to the Beaufort Sea in accordance )Tj
T*(with Shackleton's original plans, she would probably have been crushed in the )Tj
T*(Arctic pack ice.[27] On her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and )Tj
T*(breakdowns, requiring repairs at every port of call.[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Personnel )Tj
T*( The Times newspaper had reported that Shackleton planned to take a dozen men )Tj
T*(to the Arctic, "chiefly those who had accompanied him on earlier )Tj
T*(expeditions".[5] In actuality, Quest left London for the south with 20¬†men, of )Tj
T*(whom eight were old Endurance comrades; another, James Dell, was a veteran from )Tj
T*(the Discovery, 20¬†years previously.[28] Some of the Endurance hands had not )Tj
T*(been fully paid from the earlier expedition, but were prepared to join )Tj
T*(Shackleton again out of personal loyalty.[14][29] )Tj
T*( Frank Wild, on his fourth trip with Shackleton, filled the second-in-command )Tj
T*(post as he had on the Endurance expedition. Frank Worsley, Endurance's former )Tj
T*(captain, became captain of Quest. Other old comrades included the two surgeons, )Tj
T*(Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy, the meteorologist Leonard Hussey, the )Tj
T*(engineer Alexander Kerr, seaman Tom McLeod and cook Charles Green.[14] )Tj
T*(Shackleton had assumed that Tom Crean would sign up, and had assigned him )Tj
T*(duties "in charge of boats",[30] but Crean had retired from the navy to start a )Tj
T*(family back home in County Kerry, and declined Shackleton's invitation.[30] )Tj
T*( Of the newcomers, Roderick Carr, a New Zealand-born Royal Air Force pilot, was )Tj
T*(hired to fly the expedition's aeroplane, an Avro "Antarctic" Baby: an Avro Baby )Tj
T*(modified as a seaplane with an 80-horse power engine.[31][32] He had met )Tj
T*(Shackleton in North Russia, and had recently been serving as Chief of Staff to )Tj
T*(the Lithuanian air force.[33] In fact, the aeroplane was not used during the )Tj
T*(expedition due to some missing parts, and Carr therefore assisted with the )Tj
T*(scientific work.[34] The scientific staff included Australian biologist Hubert )Tj
T*(Wilkins, who had Arctic experience, and the Canadian geologist Vibert Douglas, )Tj
T*(who had initially signed for the aborted Beaufort Sea expedition.[34] The )Tj
T*(recruits who caught the most public attention were two members of the Boy )Tj
T*(Scouts' movement, Norman Mooney and James Marr. As the result of publicity )Tj
T*(organised by the Daily Mail newspaper, these two had been selected to join the )Tj
T*(expedition out of around 1,700¬†Scouts who had applied to go.[35] Mooney, who )Tj
T*(was from the Orkney Islands, soon dropped out, leaving the ship at Madeira )Tj
T*(after suffering chronic seasickness.[36] Marr, an 18-year-old from Aberdeen, )Tj
T*(remained with the expedition throughout, winning plaudits from Shackleton and )Tj
T*(Wild for his application to the tasks at hand. After being put to work in the )Tj
T*(ship's coal bunkers, according to Wild, Marr "came out of the trial very well, )Tj

T*( [edit] Expedition )Tj
T*( [edit] Voyage south )Tj
T*( Quest sailed from St Katherine's Dock, London, on 17 September 1921, after )Tj
T*(inspection by King George V.[37] Large crowds gathered on the banks of the )Tj
T*(river and on the bridges, to witness the event. Marr wrote in his diary that it )Tj
T*(was as though "all London had conspired together to bid us a heartening )Tj
T*(farewell".[23] )Tj
T*( Shackleton's original intention was to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the )Tj
T*(main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for )Tj
T*(the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore )Tj
T*(the coastline in the direction of Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At the end of )Tj
T*(the summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape )Tj
T*(Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work.[23] However, the )Tj
T*(ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. )Tj
T*(Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and )Tj
T*(further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands.[38] These delays and the )Tj
T*(slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to )Tj
T*(sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he )Tj
T*(turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a )Tj
T*(thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.[38] )Tj
T*( The engine overhaul, and the replacement of the damaged topmast,[39] delayed )Tj
T*(the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant that it was no longer practical to )Tj
T*(proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Instead, Shackleton decided that )Tj
T*(the ship would sail directly to Grytviken harbour in South Georgia.[40] )Tj
T*(Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be )Tj
T*(sacrificed, but Shackleton evidently hoped that this shortfall could be made up )Tj
T*(in South Georgia.[40] He was vague about the direction the expedition should )Tj
T*(take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, "The Boss says...quite )Tj
T*(frankly that he does not know what he will do."[41][42] )Tj
T*( [edit] Death of Shackleton )Tj
T*( On 17 December, the day before Quest was due to leave Rio, Shackleton fell )Tj
T*(ill. He may have suffered a heart attack;[43] Macklin was called, but )Tj
T*(Shackleton refused to be examined and declared himself "better" the next )Tj
T*(morning.[41][44] On the ensuing voyage to South Georgia he was, from the )Tj
T*(accounts of his shipmates, unusually subdued and listless. He also began )Tj
T*(drinking champagne each morning, "to deaden the pain", contrary to his normal )Tj
T*(rule of not allowing liquor at sea.[41] A severe storm ruined the expedition's )Tj
T*(proposed Christmas celebrations, and a new problem with the engine's steam )Tj
T*(furnace slowed progress and caused Shackleton further stress.[45] By 1 January )Tj
T*(1922, the weather had abated: "Rest and calm after the storm ‚Äì the year has )Tj
T*(begun kindly for us", wrote Shackleton in his diary.[46] On 4 January 1922, )Tj
T*(South Georgia was sighted, and late that morning Quest anchored at Grytviken. )Tj
T*( After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton returned to the )Tj
T*(ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their )Tj
T*(deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his )Tj
T*(diary.[44][47] "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. )Tj
T*("It is a strange and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening )Tj
T*(twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay."[46] Later he slept, )Tj
T*(and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his )Tj
T*(watch-keeping duty.[47] Shortly after 2¬†a.m. on the morning of 5 January, )Tj
T*(Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. )Tj
T*(According to Macklin's diary, he found Shackleton complaining of back pains and )Tj
T*(severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief )Tj
T*(discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and )Tj
T*(needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: )Tj
T*("You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?" )Tj
T*(Macklin replied "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." )Tj
T*(Immediately afterwards Shackleton "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he )Tj
T*(died".[48][49] )Tj

T*( The death certificate, signed by Macklin, gave the cause as "Atheroma of the )Tj
T*(Coronary arteries and Heart failure"‚Äîin modern terms, coronary thrombosis.[50] )Tj
T*(Later that morning Wild, now in command, gave the news to the shocked crew, and )Tj
T*(told them that the expedition would carry on.[51] The body was brought ashore )Tj
T*(for embalming before its return to England. On 19 January, Leonard Hussey )Tj
T*(accompanied the body aboard a steamer bound for Montevideo, but on arrival )Tj
T*(there he found a message from Lady Shackleton, requesting that the body be )Tj
T*(returned to South Georgia for burial.[50] Hussey accompanied the body aboard a )Tj
T*(British steamer, and returned to Grytviken.[50] Here, on 5 March, Shackleton )Tj
T*(was buried in the Norwegian cemetery; Quest had meantime sailed, so only Hussey )Tj
T*(of Shackleton's former comrades was present.[52] A rough cross marked the )Tj
T*(grave, until it was replaced by a tall granite column six years later.[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] Voyage to the ice )Tj
T*( As leader, Wild had first to decide where the expedition should now go. Kerr )Tj
T*(reported that the furnace problem was manageable, and after supplementing )Tj
T*(stores and equipment with what was available in South Georgia, Wild decided to )Tj
T*(proceed in general accordance with Shackleton's original plans. He would take )Tj
T*(the ship eastward towards Bouvet Island and then beyond, before turning south )Tj
T*(to enter the ice as close as possible to Enderby Land, and begin coastal survey )Tj
T*(work there. The expedition would also investigate an "Appearance of Land" in )Tj
T*(the mouth of the Weddell Sea, reported by Sir James Clark Ross in 1842, but not )Tj
T*(seen since. Ultimately, however, progress would depend on weather, ice )Tj
T*(conditions, and the capabilities of the ship.[54] )Tj
T*( Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading south-east towards the South )Tj
T*(Sandwich Islands. There was a heavy swell, such that the overladen ship )Tj
T*(frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with )Tj
T*(water.[56] As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, was )Tj
T*(leaking and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was )Tj
T*(slow. All these factors led him, at the end of January, to change his plan. )Tj
T*(Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought )Tj
T*(them to the edge of the pack ice on 4 February.[57] )Tj
T*( "Now the little Quest can really try her mettle", wrote Wild, as the ship )Tj
T*(entered the loose pack.[58] He noted that Quest was the smallest ship ever to )Tj
T*(attempt to penetrate the heavy Antarctic ice, and pondered on the fate of )Tj
T*(others. "Shall we escape, or will the Quest join the ships in Davy Jones's )Tj
T*(Locker?"[58][59] During the days that followed, as they moved southward in )Tj
T*(falling temperatures, the ice thickened. On 12 February they reached the most )Tj
T*(southerly latitude they would attain, 69¬∞17'S, and their most easterly )Tj
T*(longitude, 17¬∞9'E, well short of Enderby Land. Noting the state of the sea ice )Tj
T*(and fearing being frozen in, Wild "beat a hasty and energetic retreat" to the )Tj
T*(north and west.[60] Wild still hoped to tackle the heavy ice, and if possible )Tj
T*(to break through to the hidden land beyond. On 18 February he turned the ship )Tj
T*(south again for another try, but was no more successful than before.[61] On 24 )Tj
T*(February, after a series of further efforts had failed, Wild set a course )Tj
T*(westward across the mouth of the Weddell Sea. The ship would try to visit )Tj
T*(Elephant Island in the South Shetlands, before returning to South Georgia on )Tj
T*(the onset of winter.[62] )Tj
T*( For the most part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea proceeded )Tj
T*(uneventfully. Wild and Worsley were not hitting it off, according to )Tj
T*(Macklin,[63] and there was other discontent among the crew which Wild, in his )Tj
T*(own account, dealt with by the threat of "the most drastic treatment".[64] On )Tj
T*(12 March they reached 64¬∞11'S, 46¬∞4'W, which was the area where Ross had )Tj
T*(recorded an "Appearance of Land" in 1842, but there was no sign of it, and a )Tj
T*(depth sounding of over 2,300¬†fathoms \(13,800¬†ft, 4,200¬†m.\) indicated no )Tj
T*(likelihood of land nearby.[65] Between 15‚Äì21 March Quest was frozen into the )Tj
T*(ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. When the ship broke free, )Tj
T*(Wild set a course directly for Elephant Island, where he hoped that the coal )Tj
T*(supply could be supplemented by blubber from the elephant seals there.[66] On )Tj
T*(25 March the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, )Tj
T*(the site of the old Endurance expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. )Tj

T*(They viewed the site through binoculars, picking out the old landmarks, before )Tj
T*(landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals.[67] They were able to )Tj
T*(obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, with a favourable wind, )Tj
T*(they managed to reach South Georgia on 6 April.[67] )Tj
T*( [edit] Return )Tj
T*( Quest remained in South Georgia for a month, during which time Shackleton's )Tj
T*(old comrades erected a memorial cairn to their former leader, on a headland )Tj
T*(overlooking the entrance to Grytviken harbor.[68]Quest finally sailed for South )Tj
T*(Africa on 8 May. The first port of call, however, was to be Tristan da Cunha, a )Tj
T*(remote inhabited island to the west and south of Cape Town. Here, on the orders )Tj
T*(of the Chief Scout, Marr was to present a flag to the local Scout )Tj
T*(Troop.[69][70] After a rough crossing of the "Roaring Forties", Quest arrived )Tj
T*(at Tristan da Cunha on 20 May.[71] )Tj
T*( During the five-day stay, with the help of some of the islanders, the )Tj
T*(expedition made brief landings on the small Inaccessible Island, 20 miles \(32¬†)Tj
T*(km\) south-west of Tristan, and visited the even smaller Nightingale Island, )Tj
T*(collecting specimens.[72] Wild's impressions of the stay at Tristan were not )Tj
T*(altogether favourable. He noted the appalling squalor and poverty, and said of )Tj
T*(the population: "They are ignorant, shut off almost completely from the world, )Tj
T*(horribly limited in outlook."[73] Despite these reservations, the Scout parade )Tj
T*(and flag presentation took place before Quest sailed on to Gough Island, 200 )Tj
T*(miles \(320¬†km\) to the east.[70] Here members of the expedition took geological )Tj
T*(and botanical samples.[71] They arrived at Cape Town on 18 June, to be greeted )Tj
T*(by enthusiastic crowds. The South African Prime Minister, Jan Smuts, gave an )Tj
T*(official reception for them, and they were honoured at dinners and lunches by )Tj
T*(local organisations.[71] )Tj
T*( They were also met by Rowett's agent, with the message that they should return )Tj
T*(to England.[74] Wild wrote: "I should have liked one more season in the Enderby )Tj
T*(Quadrant...much might be accomplished by making Cape Town our starting point )Tj
T*(and setting out early in the season."[75] However, on 19 July they left Cape )Tj
T*(Town and sailed northwards. Their final visits were to St Helena, Ascension )Tj
T*(Island and St Vincent. On 16 September, one year after departure, they arrived )Tj
T*(at Plymouth Harbour.[76] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( [edit] Assessment )Tj
T*( According to Wild, the expedition ended "quietly", although his biographer )Tj
T*(Leif Mills writes of enthusiastic crowds in Plymouth Sound.[77][78] At the end )Tj
T*(of his account, Wild expressed the hope that the information they had brought )Tj
T*(back might "prove of value in helping to solve the great natural problems that )Tj
T*(still beset us".[77] These results were summarised in five brief appendices to )Tj
T*(Wild's book.[79] The summaries reflected the efforts of the scientific staff to )Tj
T*(collect data and specimens at each port of call,[80] and the geological and )Tj
T*(survey work carried out by Carr and Douglas on South Georgia, before the )Tj
T*(southern voyage.[81] Eventually a few scientific papers and articles were )Tj
T*(developed from this material,[82] but it was, in Leif Mills's words, "little )Tj
T*(enough to show for a year's work".[80] )Tj
T*( The lack of a clear, defined expedition objective[83][84] was aggravated by )Tj
T*(the failure to call at Cape Town on the way south, with the result that )Tj
T*(important equipment was not picked up. On South Georgia, Wild found little that )Tj
T*(could make up for this loss‚Äîthere were no dogs on the island, so no sledging )Tj
T*(work could be carried out, which eliminated Wild's preferred choice of a )Tj
T*(revised expedition goal, an exploration of Graham Land on the Antarctic )Tj
T*(peninsula.[85] The death of Shackleton before the beginning of serious work was )Tj
T*(a heavy blow, and questions were raised about the adequacy of Wild as his )Tj
T*(replacement. Some reports have Wild drinking heavily‚Äî"practically an )Tj
T*(alcoholic", according to Shackleton's biographer, Roland Huntford.[86][87] )Tj
T*(Mills suggests, however, that even if Shackleton had lived to complete the )Tj
T*(expedition, it is arguable whether, under the circumstances, it could have )Tj
T*(achieved more than it did under Wild's command.[84] On the voyage south, )Tj
T*(colleagues had been struck by the changes in Shackleton‚Äîhis listlessness, )Tj

T*(docility and vacillation.[88] )Tj
T*( As for technical innovation, the failure of the aeroplane to fly was another )Tj
T*(disappointment. Shackleton's hopes had been high that he could pioneer the use )Tj
T*(of this form of transport in Antarctic waters, and he had discussed this issue )Tj
T*(with the British Air Ministry.[89] According to Fisher's account, essential )Tj
T*(aeroplane parts had been sent on to Cape Town, but remained uncollected.[90] )Tj
T*(The long-range, 220-volt wireless equipment did not work properly and was )Tj
T*(abandoned early on. The smaller, 110-volt equipment worked only within a range )Tj
T*(of 250 miles \(400¬†km\).[20] During the Tristan visit, Wild attempted to install )Tj
T*(a new wireless apparatus with the help of a local missionary, but this was also )Tj
T*(unsuccessful.[91] )Tj
T*( [edit] End of the Heroic Age )Tj
T*( An Antarctic hiatus followed the return of Quest, there being no significant )Tj
T*(expeditions to the region for seven years.[92] The expeditions that then )Tj
T*(followed were of a different character from their predecessors, belonging to )Tj
T*(the "mechanical age" that succeeded the Heroic Age.[93] )Tj
T*( At the end of his narrative of the Quest expedition, Wild wrote of the )Tj
T*(Antarctic: "I think that my work there is done"; he never returned, closing a )Tj
T*(career which, like Shackleton's, had bracketed the Heroic Age.[76][94] None of )Tj
T*(the expedition members who were veterans from the Endurance returned to the )Tj
T*(Antarctic, although Worsley made one voyage to the Arctic in 1925.[95] Of the )Tj
T*(other crew and staff of Quest, the Australian naturalist Hubert Wilkins became )Tj
T*(a pioneer aviator in both the Arctic and Antarctic, in 1928 flying from Point )Tj
T*(Barrow, Alaska to Spitsbergen. He also made several unsuccessful attempts )Tj
T*(during the 1930s, in collaboration with the American adventurer Lincoln )Tj
T*(Ellsworth, to fly to the South Pole.[95] James Marr, the Boy Scout, also became )Tj
T*(an Antarctic regular after qualifying as a marine biologist, joining several )Tj
T*(Australian expeditions in the late 1920s and 1930s.[96] Roderick Carr, the )Tj
T*(frustrated pilot, became an Air Marshal in the Royal Air Force.[97] )Tj

T*( Unknown \(also known as Unknown Worlds\) was an American pulp fantasy fiction )Tj
T*(magazine, published from 1939 to 1943 by Street &amp; Smith, and edited by John )Tj
T*(W. Campbell. Unknown was a companion to Street &amp; Smith's science fiction )Tj
T*(pulp, Astounding Science Fiction, which was also edited by Campbell at the )Tj
T*(time; many authors and illustrators contributed to both magazines. The leading )Tj
T*(fantasy magazine in the 1930s was Weird Tales, which focused on shock and )Tj
T*(horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and )Tj
T*(humor than Weird Tales, and put his plans into action when Eric Frank Russell )Tj
T*(sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister Barrier, about aliens who own the )Tj
T*(human race. Unknown's first issue appeared in March 1939; in addition to )Tj
T*(Sinister Barrier, it included H. L. Gold's "Trouble With Water", a humorous )Tj
T*(fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome. Gold's story was the first )Tj
T*(of many in Unknown to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic. )Tj
T*( Campbell required his authors to avoid simplistic horror fiction and insisted )Tj
T*(that the fantasy elements in a story be developed logically: for example, Jack )Tj
T*(Williamson's "Darker Than You Think" describes a world in which there is a )Tj
T*(scientific explanation for the existence of werewolves. Similarly, L. Sprague )Tj
T*(de Camp and Fletcher Pratt's Harold Shea series, about a modern American who )Tj
T*(finds himself in the worlds of various mythologies, depicts a system of magic )Tj
T*(based on mathematical logic. Other notable stories included several )Tj
T*(well-received novels by L. Ron Hubbard and short stories such as Manly Wade )Tj
T*(Wellman's "When It Was Moonlight" and Fritz Leiber's "Two Sought Adventure", )Tj
T*(the first in his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series. )Tj
T*( Unknown was forced to a bimonthly schedule in 1941 by poor sales, and )Tj
T*(cancelled in 1943 when wartime paper shortages became so acute that Campbell )Tj
T*(had to choose between turning Astounding into a bimonthly or ending Unknown. )Tj
T*(The magazine is generally regarded as the finest fantasy fiction magazine ever )Tj

T*(Street &amp; Smith.[6] The title was shortened to Astounding Stories, and it )Tj
T*(became the leading magazine in the science fiction field over the next few )Tj
T*(years under the editorship of F. Orlin Tremaine.[7][8] At the end of 1937 John )Tj
T*(W. Campbell took over as editor.[8] )Tj
T*( By 1938, Campbell was planning a fantasy companion to Astounding:[9]Weird )Tj
T*(Tales was still the leader in the fantasy genre, though competitors such as )Tj
T*(Strange Stories were also being launched.[4] Campbell began acquiring stories )Tj
T*(suitable for the new magazine, without a definite launch date in mind. When )Tj
T*(Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister Barrier, )Tj
T*(Campbell decided it was time to put his plans into action. The first issue of )Tj
T*(Unknown appeared in March 1939. It was a monthly at first, but poor sales )Tj
T*(forced a switch to a bimonthly schedule beginning in February 1941.[9][10] In )Tj
T*(December 1940 the subtitle Fantasy Fiction was added, and in October 1941 the )Tj
T*(main title was changed to Unknown Worlds;[9] both changes were intended to make )Tj
T*(the genre of the magazine clearer to potential readers.[11] When wartime paper )Tj
T*(shortages became severe in late 1943, Campbell made the choice to keep )Tj
T*(Astounding monthly and cancel Unknown, rather than switch the former to a )Tj
T*(bimonthly schedule as well. The last issue was dated October 1943.[9][10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Contents and reception )Tj
T*( Campbell's plans for Unknown were laid out in the February 1939 issue of )Tj
T*(Astounding, in the announcement of the new magazine. He argued that "it has )Tj
T*(been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made )Tj
T*(the very word anathema ... [Unknown] will offer fantasy of a quality so far )Tj
T*(different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire )Tj
T*(understanding of the term".[9] The first issue, the following month, led with )Tj
T*(Russell's Sinister Barrier,[note 1] the novel that had persuaded Campbell to )Tj
T*(set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens )Tj
T*(who own the human race,[9] has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as "a )Tj
T*(strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy".[4] Campbell asked )Tj
T*(Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but )Tj
T*(still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. )Tj
T*(This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in )Tj
T*(Ashley's words, Campbell "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy".[4] )Tj
T*(The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's "Trouble with Water", a comic )Tj
T*(fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its )Tj
T*(whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic )Tj
T*(fantasy trope, "Trouble with Water" was a better indication than Sinister )Tj
T*(Barrier of the direction Unknown would take.[12] Campbell commented in a letter )Tj
T*(at the time that Sinister Barrier, "Trouble with Water", and "'Where Angels )Tj
T*(Fear ...'" by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that )Tj
T*(accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.[13][note 2] )Tj
T*( Under Campbell's editorial supervision, the fantasy element in Unknown stories )Tj
T*(had to be treated rigorously.[12] This naturally led to the appearance in )Tj
T*(Unknown of writers already comfortable with similar rigor in science fiction )Tj
T*(stories, and Campbell soon established a small group of writers as regular )Tj
T*(contributors, many of whom were also appearing in the pages of )Tj
T*(Astounding.[12]L. Ron Hubbard, Theodore Sturgeon, and L. Sprague de Camp were )Tj
T*(among the most prolific.[9][12] Hubbard contributed eight lead novels including )Tj
T*(Typewriter in the Sky, Slaves of Sleep, and Fear, described by Ashley as a )Tj
T*("classic psychological thriller";[12] sf historian and critic Thomas Clareson )Tj
T*(describes all eight as "outstanding".[9] De Camp, in collaboration with )Tj
T*(Fletcher Pratt, contributed three stories featuring Harold Shea, who finds )Tj
T*(himself in a world where magic operates by rigorous rules.[9][14] The title of )Tj
T*(one of these, "The Mathematics of Magic", is, according to sf critic John )Tj
T*(Clute, "perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention )Tj
T*(in Unknown".[15] )Tj
T*( Other Astounding writers who wrote for Unknown included Robert A. Heinlein, )Tj
T*(whose "The Devil Makes the Law" \(reprinted as "Magic, Inc."\) depicts a world )Tj
T*(where magic is a part of normal everyday life.[12] Heinlein also contributed )Tj

T*("perhaps the ultimate solipsist fantasy".[16]A.E. van Vogt, a frequent )Tj
T*(Astounding contributor, appeared in the final issue with "The Book of Ptath" )Tj
T*(\(later expanded into a novel\).[12][17]Isaac Asimov, despite multiple attempts )Tj
T*(to write for Unknown, never appeared in the magazine. On his sixth attempt, he )Tj
T*(sold "Author! Author!" to Campbell, but the magazine was cancelled before it )Tj
T*(could appear.[18] It eventually appeared in the anthology The Unknown Five.[19] )Tj
T*( In addition to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, )Tj
T*(there was a good deal of overlap between their readerships:[20] Asimov records )Tj
T*(that during the war, he read only these two magazines.[21][note 3] Sf historian )Tj
T*(Paul Carter has argued that in fact the spectrum of fantastic fiction from )Tj
T*(Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than )Tj
T*(is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such )Tj
T*(as Wonder Stories were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were )Tj
T*(tales of scientific imagination.[20] )Tj
T*( Fritz Leiber's first published story was "Two Sought Adventure", which )Tj
T*(appeared in the August 1939 issue of Unknown; this was the first story in his )Tj
T*(long-running Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series about a pair of adventurers in a )Tj
T*(sword and sorcery setting. Four more Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories )Tj
T*(appeared in Unknown in as many years, and Leiber's novel Conjure Wife, about a )Tj
T*(man who discovers that all women are secretly witches, was the lead story in )Tj
T*(the April 1943 issue. The protagonist, a university professor, "is forced to )Tj
T*(abandon scepticism and discover the underlying equations of magic, via symbolic )Tj
T*(logic", in critic David Langford's description.[22] Leiber also contributed )Tj
T*("Smoke Ghost" in October 1941, described by Ashley as "arguably the first )Tj
T*(seriously modern ghost story".[14] Another writer whose first story appeared in )Tj
T*(Unknown was James H. Schmitz, whose "Greenface" appeared in the August 1943 )Tj
T*(issue.[17][23] )Tj
T*( Other notable stories that appeared in Unknown include Jack Williamson's )Tj
T*("Darker Than You Think" \(December 1940\), which provides a scientific basis for )Tj
T*(a race of werewolves living undetected alongside human beings. Expanded into a )Tj
T*(novel in 1948, it remains Williamson's best-known fantasy, and sf historian )Tj
T*(Malcolm Edwards comments that the two protagonists' relationship is "depicted )Tj
T*(with a tortured \(and still haunting\) erotic frankness unusual in genre )Tj
T*(literature of the 1940s".[4][24] In addition to the Harold Shea pieces, de Camp )Tj
T*(published several other well-received stories, including "The Wheels of If" )Tj
T*(\(October 1940\) and "Lest Darkness Fall" \(December 1939\), an alternate history )Tj
T*(story about a time-traveler who attempts to save the Roman Empire from the )Tj
T*(coming Dark Ages; Edwards and Clute comment that the story is "the most )Tj
T*(accomplished early excursion into history in magazine sf, and is regarded as a )Tj
T*(classic".[15][25] Also highly regarded is Wellman's "When It Was Moonlight" )Tj
T*(\(December 1940\), a story about Poe.[4] )Tj
T*( The first sixteen issues of Unknown had cover paintings, but from July 1940 )Tj
T*(the cover style was changed to a table of contents, with a small ink drawing )Tj
T*(usually accompanying the summary of each story, in an attempt to make the )Tj
T*(magazine appear more dignified.[12][17] The cover art came almost entirely from )Tj
T*(artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: )Tj
T*(six of the sixteen paintings were by H. W. Scott; Manuel Islip, Modest Stein, )Tj
T*(Graves Gladney, and Edd Cartier provided the others. Cartier was the only one )Tj
T*(of these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted )Tj
T*(four of Unknown's last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.[26] )Tj
T*( [edit] Influence )Tj
T*( Unknown was, along with Weird Tales, an important early influence on the )Tj
T*(fantasy genre.[14] In the foreword to From Unknown Worlds, in 1948, Campbell )Tj
T*(commented that fantasy before Unknown had been too much infused with "gloom and )Tj
T*(terror"; his approach in Unknown had been to assume that the "creatures of )Tj
T*(mythology and folklore" could be characters in an amusing tale as easily as )Tj
T*(they could be made part of a horror story. Horror stories, he said, had a )Tj
T*(place, but "horror injected with a sharp and poisoned needle is just as )Tj
T*(effective as when applied with the blunt-instrument technique of the so-called )Tj
T*(Gothic horror tale". Campbell insisted on the same rational approach to fantasy )Tj

T*(separated itself from Weird Tales, whose fantasies still primarily aimed to )Tj
T*(produce fear or shock. The closest predecessor to Unknown was Thorne Smith, )Tj
T*(whose prohibition-era "Topper" stories also mixed fantasy with humor.[14] )Tj
T*(Before Unknown, fantasy had received little serious attention, though on )Tj
T*(occasion writers such as James Branch Cabell had achieved respectability.[14] )Tj
T*(In Ashley's opinion, Unknown created the modern genre of fantasy,[14] though )Tj
T*(commercial success for the genre had to wait until the 1970s.[27] )Tj
T*( Clareson also suggests that Unknown influenced the science fiction that )Tj
T*(appeared in Astounding after Unknown folded. According to this view, stories )Tj
T*(such as Clifford Simak's City series would not have appeared without the )Tj
T*(destruction of genre boundaries that Campbell oversaw. Clareson further )Tj
T*(proposes that Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science )Tj
T*(Fiction, two of the most important and successful science fiction and fantasy )Tj
T*(magazines, were direct descendants of Unknown.[9] )Tj
T*( Unknown is widely regarded as the finest fantasy magazine ever published:[14] )Tj
T*(Ashley says, for example, that "Unknown published without doubt the greatest )Tj
T*(collection of fantasy stories produced in one magazine."[28] Despite its lack )Tj
T*(of commercial success, Unknown is the most lamented of all science fiction and )Tj
T*(fantasy magazines; Lester del Rey describes it as having gained "a devotion )Tj
T*(from its readers that no other magazine can match".[29] Edwards comments that )Tj
T*(Unknown "appeared during Campbell's peak years as an editor; its reputation may )Tj
T*(stand as high as it does partly because it died while still at its best".[12] )Tj
T*( In a conversation with David G. Hartwell in 1962, Shirley Jackson stated she )Tj
T*(owned a complete run of Unknown and expressed strong admiration for the )Tj
T*(publication, stating "It's the best".[30] )Tj

T*(Underlining indicates that an issue was dated with the season \("Spring 1945"\))Tj
T*(rather than the month. John W. Campbell was editor throughout.[1])Tj
T*( Unknown was edited by John W. Campbell and published by Street &amp; Smith )Tj
T*(Publications throughout its run. It was pulp-sized from its launch through )Tj
T*(August 1941, and then bedsheet-sized from October 1941 to April 1943. The last )Tj
T*(three issues were pulp-sized again.[9] Street &amp; Smith had planned to switch )Tj
T*(it to digest size with the December 1943 issue, but it was cancelled before )Tj
T*(that issue appeared.[12] The price began at 20 cents and rose to 25 cents with )Tj
T*(the change to bedsheet size; it remained at 25 cents when the size changed back )Tj
T*(to pulp. It had 164 pages when pulp-sized and 130 pages while it was )Tj
T*(bedsheet-sized. It began as a monthly and switched to bimonthly from December )Tj
T*(1940 on.[9] The volume numbering was regular, with six volumes of six numbers )Tj
T*(and a final volume of three numbers.[1] )Tj
T*( The first six U.S. issues were available directly in the UK, but thereafter an )Tj
T*(abridged British reprint edition was issued by Atlas Publications, beginning in )Tj

T*( In 1948, Street &amp; Smith reprinted several stories from Unknown in a )Tj

T*(of John Campbell, but although it sold better than the original, too many )Tj

T*( The 2009 Giro d'Italia was the 92nd running of the Giro d'Italia, one of )Tj
T*(cycling's Grand Tours. It was held from 9 to 31 May 2009, and marked the 100th )Tj
T*(year since the first edition of the race. Starting in Venice and finishing in )Tj
T*(Rome,[2] 22¬†teams competed over 21¬†stages. )Tj
T*( The Giro was raced on a unique path through Italy, taking the peloton to some )Tj
T*(historic cities and towns in Italian cycling. Though the route lacked any )Tj
T*(well-known, storied climbs, the many intermediate and mountain stages in the )Tj
T*(second and third weeks of the race proved deceptively difficult.[3] The 10th )Tj
T*(and the 16th stages were both called the race's queen stage, as both contained )Tj
T*(multiple difficult mountain climbs. )Tj
T*( Riders protested during the ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest )Tj
T*(was nominally about the overall safety conditions of the stage, and was sparked )Tj
T*(by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before. In the )Tj
T*(protest, riders declined to contest the stage except for a final sprint finish, )Tj
T*(a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans. )Tj
T*( Denis Menchov won the race, having taken the lead in a long time trial in )Tj
T*(stage 12, and defended vigorously against attacks by his closest challenger, )Tj
T*(Danilo Di Luca, during the mountain stages of the final week.[4] Di Luca came )Tj
T*(in second, 41¬†seconds behind the winner, and won the mauve jersey as points )Tj
T*(classification winner. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher )Tj
T*(Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had )Tj
T*(their results stripped.[5][6] )Tj
T*( Twenty-two teams were announced for the Giro. These included fifteen ProTour )Tj
T*(teams, and seven Professional Continental teams. Three ProTour teams did not )Tj
T*(wish to participate, and were thus not invited: Cofidis, Euskaltel-Euskadi, and )Tj
T*(Fran√ßaise des Jeux.[7] Conversely, the organizers of the race originally )Tj
T*(declined to invite Fuji-Servetto,[8] but changed this decision on 23 April, )Tj
T*(inviting them as the Giro's 22nd and final team.[9] Each team sent a squad of )Tj
T*(nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198¬†cyclists.[10] )Tj
T*( The 22¬†teams that took part in the race were:[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Race previews and favorites )Tj
T*( The Astana team did not include 2008 race champion Alberto Contador, who chose )Tj

T*(recently returned from retirement.[13] Though his appearance was put in doubt )Tj
T*(after he crashed out of stage 1 of the Vuelta a Castilla y Le√≥n and broke his )Tj
T*(collarbone, Armstrong announced on 16 April that he would start the Giro )Tj
T*(despite undergoing surgery for his injury.[14] Silence-Lotto star Cadel Evans )Tj
T*(was originally announced to be taking part in the Giro,[15] but he publicly )Tj

T*(Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov.[17] Before his collarbone injury, )Tj
T*(Armstrong was considered an overall favorite, and it was also noted that three )Tj
T*(time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, )Tj
T*(might favor him.[3] Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best )Tj
T*(form, would be a rider very likely to gain from having such a long race against )Tj
T*(the clock included in the Giro.[18] )Tj
T*( Former winner Stefano Garzelli named Leipheimer as the favorite,[19] as did )Tj
T*(some American media outlets.[20][21] Armstrong considered Basso to be the )Tj
T*(favorite when speaking about the Giro in December 2008.[22] Other news outlets )Tj
T*(also referred to Basso as the pre-race favorite.[23][24] )Tj
T*( Only a small number of stages were expected to end in a sprint, barring a )Tj
T*(successful breakaway.[2] Sprinters in the event included Mark Cavendish, )Tj
T*(Alessandro Petacchi, Allan Davis, Filippo Pozzato, Robert Hunter, Robert )Tj

T*( [edit] Route and stages )Tj
T*( The first Giro d'Italia was held in 1909, and the 2009 route was designed to )Tj
T*(commemorate the 100th anniversary, though interruptions due to World War¬†I and )Tj
T*(World War¬†II meant this was only the 92nd race.[18]Milan, which had for years )Tj
T*(been the city in which the Giro concluded,[26] was the site of a ten-lap )Tj
T*(criterium on the same circuit that began the first Giro d'Italia.[18] Every )Tj
T*(city that hosted a stage start or finish in the first Giro was visited in 2009 )Tj
T*(with the exception of Genoa, although Arenzano \(in the province of Genoa\) )Tj
T*(hosted the finish to stage 11. The 11th stage also went over the Passo del )Tj
T*(Turchino, a climb used every year in the classic cycling race Milan ‚Äì San )Tj
T*(Remo.[18] )Tj
T*( The tenth stage was planned to mimic stage 17 of the 1949 Giro d'Italia, which )Tj
T*(was won by Italian cycling legend Fausto Coppi en route to the overall )Tj
T*(victory.[27] That route originally included the Col d'Izoard, a climb in France )Tj
T*(which has been featured in the Tour de France numerous times. Race organizers )Tj
T*(were forced to alter this stage to cover only the Italian side of the Alps )Tj
T*(rather than also visit France, as there were concerns over radio communication )Tj
T*(in the area, and the roads stood the risk of landslides.[28] It was )Tj
T*(subsequently made longer than first planned, with an additional, shorter climb )Tj
T*(added.[29] Stages 10 and 16, the latter of which went over Monte Petrano and )Tj
T*(two other first-category climbs, were both called the race's queen )Tj
T*(stage.[30][31] )Tj
T*( The route received a small amount of criticism for failing to include any )Tj
T*(well-known and especially difficult climbs such as the Passo del Mortirolo or )Tj
T*(Monte Zoncolan, instead including stages featuring multiple climbs with lesser )Tj
T*(ascents. Race director Angelo Zomegnan responded to the criticism by saying, "I )Tj
T*(won't follow the philosophy that the selection of climbs has to be determined )Tj
T*(by their names."[3] )Tj
T*( The 21¬†stages of the 2009 Giro d'Italia were divided into five categories: one )Tj
T*(team time trial, seven flat stages, four intermediate stages, seven mountain )Tj
T*(stages and two individual time trials.[2] The type of stage together with the )Tj
T*(average speed of the winner decided how much time each cyclist would be allowed )Tj
T*(to finish that stage before being eliminated from the race.[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Race overview )Tj
T*( The Giro began with a team time trial in Lido, a barrier island in the city of )Tj
T*(Venice. The starting order of the teams was decided by a random draw. Team )Tj
T*(Columbia-High Road, the first team to take the course, won the stage, giving )Tj
T*(their star sprinter Mark Cavendish the first pink jersey as leader of the )Tj
T*(race.[34] Cavendish was defeated in a sprint finish the following day by )Tj
T*(Italian Alessandro Petacchi, who was riding for the LPR Brakes-Farnese Vini )Tj
T*(team.[36] Petacchi became the next wearer of the pink jersey, after he won the )Tj
T*(Stage 3 sprint into Valdobbiadene.[37] Cavendish went on to win three )Tj
T*(mass-start stages,[38][39][40] but Team Columbia-High Road's success was not )Tj
T*(limited to Cavendish's victories nor the team time trial, as Edvald Boasson )Tj
T*(Hagen[41] and Kanstantsin Siutsou[42] also took stage wins. )Tj

T*(riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages )Tj
T*(16[46] and 17,[47] as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20.[48] Menchov )Tj
T*(was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior )Tj
T*(time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was )Tj
T*(able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre )Tj
T*(before the finish line.[49] )Tj
T*( Stefano Garzelli was the winner of the mountains classification, gaining )Tj
T*(points for consistent high placings on the summit stage finishes, as well as a )Tj
T*(brief breakaway on the mountainous stage 10. The points classification was won )Tj
T*(by Di Luca, after he finished in the top ten in eight of the road stages. The )Tj
T*(youth classification was won by Kevin Seeldraeyers, who remained consistent )Tj
T*(after Thomas L√∂vkvist lost nearly 25 minutes on stage 16.[46][49] L√∂vkvist had, )Tj
T*(for one day earlier in the race, led not just the youth but also the general )Tj
T*(classification.[43] )Tj
T*( Controversy arose during the ten-lap Milan criterium of the ninth stage, when )Tj
T*(the riders staged a protest over what they viewed as unsafe riding conditions )Tj
T*(in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible cause for the )Tj
T*(protest was Rabobank rider Pedro Horrillo's accident during the eighth stage; )Tj
T*(Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a )Tj
T*(barricade on the roadside while descending the Culmine di San Pietro. Horrillo )Tj
T*(fell more than 60¬†m \(200¬†ft\),[50] and nearly died as a result of his )Tj
T*(injuries.[51] After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his )Tj
T*(native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered,[52] though the day on the Culmine )Tj
T*(di San Pietro was his last as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the )Tj
T*(2010 season began.[53] )Tj
T*( The protest at first only involved the criterium being neutralized¬†‚Äì that is, )Tj
T*(the race director agreed that each rider would receive the same finishing time )Tj
T*(as the stage winner regardless of when they actually crossed the line.[54] )Tj
T*(After the riders rode a lap of the course, they decided instead not to contest )Tj
T*(the stage at all, riding the first six circuits 20¬†km/h \(12¬†mph\) slower than )Tj
T*(previous stages. After four laps, they stopped altogether as race leader Di )Tj
T*(Luca addressed the unhappy crowd to explain their actions.[55] The times for )Tj
T*(the stage did not count, and there was no aggressive riding until a final )Tj
T*(sprint finish.[55] Along with Di Luca, Lance Armstrong was considered the )Tj
T*(principal voice speaking for the peloton on this day.[56] Although the protest )Tj
T*(was referred to by some as "unanimous,"[55] cyclists such as Filippo Pozzato, )Tj
T*(who was himself bearing injuries sustained in a crash that would later force )Tj
T*(him to leave the race, said the riders had been too hasty in their decision, )Tj
T*(and that it should have been made conclusively before the stage began.[57] )Tj
T*(Armstrong apologized to the fans for the effect the protest had on what was )Tj
T*(supposed to be a grand spectacle,[58] but also contended that it was the )Tj
T*(correct decision for the peloton to make.[59] )Tj
T*( Success in stages was limited to a few teams. Though there were nearly as many )Tj
T*(stages \(21\) as teams in the event \(22\), only eight teams ultimately came away )Tj
T*(with stage victories. Six different riders won multiple stages¬†‚Äì Cavendish, )Tj
T*(Petacchi, Menchov, Di Luca,[43][60]Carlos Sastre,[46][61] and Michele )Tj

T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( About two months after the event concluded, on 22 July, it was announced that )Tj
T*(second place overall finisher and points classification winner Di Luca had )Tj
T*(given two positive tests for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator )Tj
T*(\(CERA, an erythropoietin derivative\) on 20 and 28 May, before the Cinque Terre )Tj
T*(time trial and the Mount Vesuvius stage in the race's final week.[5] He was )Tj
T*(provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the Union Cycliste )Tj
T*(Internationale \(UCI\), cycling's governing body.[5] It was announced on 8 August )Tj
T*(that the analyses of the B-samples from those controls confirmed the initial )Tj
T*(results, making it likely that Di Luca will be stripped of some or all of his )Tj
T*(results from the race.[67][68] LPR Brakes-Farnese Vini fired him on 13 )Tj
T*(August.[69] Di Luca at first maintained his innocence and claimed a conspiracy )Tj
T*(against him by the labs handling the tests.[70][71] A period of legal )Tj
T*(maneuvering between Di Luca and the Italian National Olympic Committee \(CONI\) )Tj
T*(followed. CONI officials asked their anti-doping tribunal \(TNA\) to suspend Di )Tj
T*(Luca for three years¬†‚Äì while two years is a customary ban for a doping )Tj
T*(positive,[72] CONI prosecutors sought a third year for recidivism, stemming )Tj
T*(from Di Luca's previous doping incident two years earlier. He was given a )Tj
T*(two-year suspension, retroactive to July 2009, and indicated that he would )Tj
T*(appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[73] In October 2010, Di Luca )Tj
T*(was reinstated to active status by CONI, due to his cooperation with several )Tj
T*(ongoing doping investigations, though his results were indeed stricken from the )Tj
T*(record.[74] On 10 January 2011, he signed with Team Katusha and indicated that )Tj
T*(he would return to the Giro in 2011 to support Katusha team leader Joaquim )Tj
T*(Rodr√≠guez.[75] )Tj
T*( Five days before the start of the 2010 Giro d'Italia, 2009 podium finisher )Tj
T*(Pellizotti was identified as a rider of interest to the UCI's biological )Tj
T*(passport program due to irregular blood values. He was removed from his team's )Tj
T*(start list for the Giro and provisionally suspended.[76] The UCI asked that )Tj
T*(CONI open disciplinary proceedings against him,[77] which had no resolution )Tj
T*(until after the 2010 season finished. TNA cleared him on 21 October and )Tj
T*(declared him free to race, at which time the Liquigas team intended to re-sign )Tj
T*(him.[78] The UCI decided in January 2011 to appeal his case to the CAS.[79] The )Tj
T*(hearing was held in March, and Pellizotti asked for a quick resolution, with )Tj
T*(plans to return with Movistar Team in the 2011 Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico if he were )Tj
T*(cleared. The court reached its decision after five days, upholding the UCI's )Tj
T*(appeal, handing Pellizotti a two-year ban, and stripping all his results from )Tj
T*(this Giro and the 2009 Tour de France.[80] Consequently, Pellizotti has said he )Tj
T*(is quitting the sport.[81] )Tj
T*( [edit] Classification leadership )Tj
T*( In the 2009 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the )Tj
T*(general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on )Tj
T*(each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on )Tj
T*(mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is )Tj
T*(considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is )Tj
T*(considered the winner of the Giro.[32] )Tj
T*( Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. )Tj
T*(In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 )Tj
T*(in a stage. The stage win awarded 25¬†points, second place awarded 20¬†points, )Tj
T*(third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the )Tj

T*(line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in )Tj
T*(intermediate sprints.[32] )Tj
T*( There was also a mountains classification, which awarded a green jersey. In )Tj
T*(the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a )Tj
T*(mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, )Tj
T*(second, or third category, with more points available for the )Tj
T*(higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro \(called the Cima )Tj
T*(Coppi\), which in 2009 was Sestri√®re in stage 10,[82] afforded more points than )Tj
T*(the other first-category climbs.[32] )Tj
T*( The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, which awarded a )Tj
T*(white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but )Tj
T*(only riders born after 1 January 1984 were eligible.[32] )Tj
T*( There were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast )Tj
T*(Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on )Tj
T*(each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total )Tj
T*(time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20¬†)Tj
T*(placed riders on each stage earning points \(20 for first place, 19 for second )Tj

T*( [edit] Minor classifications )Tj
T*( Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special )Tj
T*(jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned )Tj
T*(throughout the three weeks of the tour.[32][66] Each mass-start stage had one )Tj
T*(intermediate sprint, the Traguardo Volante, or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds )Tj
T*(towards the general classification, points towards the regular points )Tj
T*(classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was )Tj
T*(known in previous years as the "Intergiro" and the "Expo Milano 2015" )Tj
T*(classification.[32] It was won by Italian Giovanni Visconti, of ISD.[66] )Tj
T*( Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation )Tj
T*(of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes )Tj
T*(and stage finishes. Mountains classification winner Stefano Garzelli won this )Tj
T*(award.[32][66] The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing )Tj
T*(order, but points were only awarded for the top three finishers in each stage. )Tj
T*(It was won, like the closely associated points classification, by Danilo Di )Tj
T*(Luca.[32][66] Additionally, the Trofeo Fuga Cervelo rewarded riders who took )Tj
T*(part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or )Tj
T*(fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. )Tj
T*(Quick Step's Mauro Facci was first in this competition.[32][66] Teams were )Tj
T*(given penalty points for minor technical infringements. Silence-Lotto and Quick )Tj
T*(Step were most successful in avoiding penalties, and so shared leadership of )Tj
T*(the Fair Play classification.[32][66] )Tj
T*( [edit] World Rankings points )Tj
T*( The Giro was one of 24¬†events throughout the season that contributed points )Tj
T*(towards the 2009 UCI World Ranking. Points were awarded to the top 20¬†finishers )Tj

T*(and his Irish wife, Hannah Daly.[7] She was raised as a Roman Catholic [8] in )Tj
T*(their farmhouse in East Wickham with her older brothers, John and Paddy.[9] )Tj
T*(Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was a former Irish folk )Tj
T*(dancer, her father was an accomplished pianist, Paddy worked as a musical )Tj
T*(instrument maker and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were )Tj
T*(involved in the local folk music scene.[10] )Tj
T*( John was a karateka at Goldsmiths College karate club and Kate also trained )Tj
T*(there, becoming known as "Ee-ee" because of her squeaky kiai. One of the )Tj
T*(instructors, Dave Hazard, later noted in his autobiography that her dance moves )Tj
T*(seemed to owe something to karate.[11] )Tj
T*( Her family's musical influence inspired the young Kate to teach herself to )Tj
T*(play the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her )Tj
T*(parents' house and studied the violin.[12] She soon began writing her own tunes )Tj
T*(and eventually added lyrics to them.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career )Tj
T*( Bush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School \(later the St Joseph's campus )Tj
T*(of Bexley College\) and a Catholic girls' school on Woolwich Road in Abbey Wood, )Tj
T*(London, in the mid-1970s. During this time her family produced a demo tape with )Tj
T*(over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. David )Tj
T*(Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of )Tj
T*(Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the )Tj
T*(sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded that )Tj
T*(would be more saleable to the record companies.[14] Three tracks in total were )Tj
T*(recorded and paid for by Gilmour.[15] The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend )Tj
T*(Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums,[13] and )Tj
T*(sound engineer Geoff Emerick.[16] The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry )Tj
T*(Slater.[17] Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her.[18] The British )Tj
T*(record industry was reaching a point of stagnation.[17]Progressive rock was )Tj
T*(very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, )Tj
T*(thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental )Tj
T*(acts.[17] )Tj
T*( Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI )Tj
T*(group-repertoire division. According to Mercer he felt Bush's material was good )Tj
T*(enough to be released but felt that if the album failed it would be )Tj
T*(demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it.[19] For )Tj
T*(the first two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than )Tj
T*(making an album. She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having )Tj
T*(gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications.[20] In 2005, Bush stated in an interview )Tj
T*(with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before she )Tj
T*(was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a )Tj
T*(contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance )Tj
T*(which she used to enrol in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a )Tj
T*(former teacher of David Bowie,[21] and mime training with Adam Darius.[22] )Tj
T*( Bush also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs, a few of which today can )Tj
T*(be found on bootleg recordings and are known as the Phoenix Recordings.[23] )Tj
T*(From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses around )Tj
T*(London ‚Äì specifically at the Rose of Lee public house \(now Dirty South\) in )Tj
T*(Lewisham. The other three band members were Del Palmer \(bass\), Brian Bath )Tj
T*(\(guitar\), and Vic King \(drums\). She began recording her first album in August )Tj
T*(1977,[13] although two tracks had been recorded during the summer of 1975. )Tj
T*( [edit] The Kick Inside and Lionheart )Tj
T*( As part of her preparation for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the )Tj
T*(KT Bush Band. However, for her debut album The Kick Inside \(1978\) she was )Tj
T*(persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain )Tj
T*(even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.[24] Her brother Paddy )Tj
T*(played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play )Tj
T*(more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott )Tj
T*(played some of the drums and would become her main percussionist on subsequent )Tj
T*(albums.[25] )Tj

T*(had been written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more )Tj
T*(rock-oriented track "James and the Cold Gun" to be her debut single, but Bush )Tj
T*(insisted that it should be "Wuthering Heights". Even at this early stage of her )Tj
T*(career, she had gained a reputation for her determination to have a say in )Tj
T*(decisions affecting her work.[13] "Wuthering Heights" topped the UK and )Tj
T*(Australian charts and became an international hit.[26] Bush became the first )Tj
T*(woman to reach number one in the UK charts with a self-penned song.[27] A )Tj
T*(second single, "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", reached number six in the )Tj
T*(UK charts.[28] It also made it onto the American Billboard Hot 100 where it )Tj
T*(reached number 85 in early 1979. Bob Mercer felt that Bush's relative lack of )Tj
T*(success in the United States compared to the rest of the world was due to her )Tj
T*(music being a poor fit for American radio formats and that there were no )Tj
T*(outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal.[19] "The Man with )Tj
T*(the Child in His Eyes" went on to win her an Ivor Novello Award in 1979 for )Tj
T*(Outstanding British Lyric.[29] )Tj
T*( EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of )Tj
T*(her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with NME )Tj
T*(magazine in 1982, Bush criticised the marketing technique, stating: "People )Tj
T*(weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The )Tj
T*(media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm )Tj
T*(an artist in a female body."[13] In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly )Tj
T*(record a follow-up album, Lionheart, to take advantage of the success of The )Tj
T*(Kick Inside. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with Lionheart, feeling )Tj
T*(that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew )Tj
T*(Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most )Tj
T*(notably "Wow", it did not garner the same reception as her first album, )Tj
T*(reaching number six in the UK album charts.[30] )Tj
T*( Bush was displeased with being rushed into making the second album. She set up )Tj
T*(her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, )Tj
T*(Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, )Tj
T*(along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors.[13] )Tj
T*(Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy )Tj
T*(promotional work and an exhausting tour, the only one of her career.[31] The )Tj
T*(tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This )Tj
T*(live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake.[32] )Tj
T*(Typical of her determination to have control, she was involved in every aspect )Tj
T*(of the show's production, choreography, set design, and staff recruitment.[13] )Tj
T*(The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume )Tj
T*(changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound )Tj
T*(engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first )Tj
T*(headset mic to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group Spotnicks )Tj
T*(used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.[1][33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Never for Ever and The Dreaming )Tj
T*( Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into )Tj
T*(production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first time as a producer was on )Tj
T*(her Live On Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two )Tj
T*(albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with )Tj
T*(orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on )Tj
T*(Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker )Tj
T*("Violin" to the wistful waltz of hit single "Army Dreamers". )Tj
T*( Never for Ever was the first Kate Bush album to feature synthesisers and drum )Tj
T*(machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when )Tj
T*(providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early )Tj
T*(1980.[13] It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album )Tj
T*(charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that )Tj
T*(status,[20] and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the )Tj
T*(top.[4] The top-selling single from the album was "Babooshka", which reached )Tj
T*(number five in the UK singles chart.[34] In November 1980, she released the )Tj
T*(standalone Christmas single "December Will Be Magic Again", which reached )Tj
T*(number 29 in the UK charts. )Tj

T*( September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced )Tj
T*(by herself.[35] It was also a major departure for Bush, being initially )Tj
T*(composed on the Fairlight CMI rather than piano, with songs extensively revised )Tj
T*(and rebuilt in the studio, rather than merely arranged there.[citation needed] )Tj
T*(With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, )Tj
T*(creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known )Tj
T*(for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed )Tj
T*(critical reception in the UK, and many were baffled by the dense soundscapes )Tj
T*(Bush had created to become "less accessible",[36] with some critics suggesting )Tj
T*(that the album was over-produced.[citation needed] In a 1993 interview with Q, )Tj
T*(Bush stated: "That was my 'She's gone mad' album."[13] However, the album )Tj
T*(became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching )Tj
T*(number 157.[13] The album entered the UK album chart at number three, but is to )Tj
T*(date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc. )Tj
T*( "Sat in Your Lap" was the first single from the album to be released. It )Tj
T*(pre-dated the album by over a year and peaked at number 11 in the UK.[37] The )Tj
T*(album's title track, featuring the talents of Rolf Harris and Percy Edwards, )Tj
T*(stalled at number 48, while the third single, "There Goes a Tenner", failed to )Tj
T*(chart, despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track "Suspended in Gaffa" was )Tj
T*(released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK. )Tj
T*( Continuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own )Tj
T*(personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for )Tj
T*("There Goes a Tenner", a documentary about the war in Vietnam for "Pull Out the )Tj
T*(Pin", and the plight of Indigenous Australians for "The Dreaming". "Houdini" is )Tj
T*(about the magician's death, and "Get Out Of My House" was inspired by Stephen )Tj
T*(King's novel The Shining.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Hounds of Love and The Whole Story )Tj
T*( Hounds of Love was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio )Tj
T*(space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where )Tj
T*(she could work at her own pace.[39]Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts )Tj
T*(in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number one position.[40] )Tj
T*( The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very )Tj
T*(different sides. The first side, Hounds of Love, contains five "accessible" pop )Tj
T*(songs, including the four singles "Running Up that Hill", "Cloudbusting", )Tj
T*("Hounds of Love", and "The Big Sky". "Running Up that Hill" reached number¬†3 in )Tj
T*(the UK charts and also re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to )Tj
T*(number¬†30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1985. The second side of the )Tj
T*(album, The Ninth Wave, takes its name from Tennyson's poem, "Idylls of the )Tj
T*(King", about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is seven interconnecting )Tj
T*(songs joined in one continuous piece of music.[41] )Tj
T*( The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, )Tj
T*(Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 BRIT Awards. In the same year, Bush )Tj
T*(and Peter Gabriel had a UK top ten hit with "Don't Give Up" \(Dolly Parton, )Tj
T*(Gabriel's original choice, turned his offer down\),[42] and EMI released her )Tj
T*("greatest hits" album, The Whole Story. Bush provided a new lead vocal and )Tj
T*(refreshed backing track on "Wuthering Heights," and recorded a new single, )Tj
T*("Experiment IV," for inclusion on the compilation. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, )Tj
T*(Bush won the award for Best Female Solo Artist. )Tj
T*( [edit] The Sensual World and The Red Shoes )Tj
T*( The increasingly personal tone of her writing continued on 1989's The Sensual )Tj
T*(World, with songs about unexpressed and unrequited love \("Love and Anger" and )Tj
T*("Never Be Mine", respectively\), and the pressures on modern relationships )Tj
T*(\("Between a Man and a Woman"\).[citation needed] One of the quirkiest tracks on )Tj
T*(the album, touched by Bush's black humour, is "Heads We're Dancing", about a )Tj
T*(woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the )Tj
T*(morning that he is Adolf Hitler.[43] The title track drew its inspiration from )Tj
T*(James Joyce's novel Ulysses.[43] )Tj
T*( The Sensual World went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, )Tj
T*(receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000¬†)Tj

T*(and "And So Is Love" all reached the top¬†30.[37][48] In 1994, Bush released an )Tj
T*(accompanying short film, The Line, the Cross &amp; the Curve. Written, directed )Tj
T*(by, and starring Bush, along with English actress Miranda Richardson,[49] the )Tj
T*(film was based around the concept of The Red Shoes and featured six of the )Tj
T*(songs from the album. )Tj
T*( The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour )Tj
T*(transpired. Thus, Bush deliberately aimed for a live-band feel, with less of )Tj
T*(the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and which would )Tj
T*(have been too difficult to re-create on stage.[50] The result alienated some of )Tj
T*(her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions,[51] )Tj
T*(but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they )Tj
T*(expressed.[52] )Tj
T*( This period had been a troubled time for Bush. She had suffered a series of )Tj
T*(bereavements, including the loss of guitarist Alan Murphy, who had started )Tj
T*(working with her on The Tour Of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom )Tj
T*(she was exceptionally close.[20] Many of the people she lost are honoured in )Tj
T*(the ballad "Moments of Pleasure." However, Bush's mother was still alive when )Tj
T*("Moments of Pleasure" was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song )Tj
T*(to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying, )Tj
T*("Every old sock meets an old shoe," was hilarious and "couldn't stop )Tj
T*(laughing."[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aerial )Tj
T*( After the release of The Red Shoes, Bush dropped out of the public eye for )Tj
T*(many years, although her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours )Tj
T*(of a new album release. Bush had originally intended to take one year off but )Tj
T*(despite working on material twelve years passed before her next album )Tj
T*(release.[54] The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes )Tj
T*(drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's Great )Tj
T*(Expectations.[55] In reality, she was trying to give her young son a normal )Tj
T*(childhood, and needed a quiet place for her creative process to function.[54] )Tj
T*(In 1998, Bush had given birth to Albert, known as "Bertie", fathered by her )Tj
T*(guitarist and now-husband Danny McIntosh.[20][56] After living for many years )Tj
T*(on Court Road, Eltham, southeast London, the couple and their son moved away )Tj
T*(from the city and currently have two homes: a ¬£2.5¬†million house in East )Tj
T*(Portlemouth on the Devon coast[56] and a mansion on an islet on the Kennet and )Tj
T*(Avon Canal at Sulhamstead in West Berkshire.[57] )Tj
T*( Bush's eighth studio album, Aerial, was released on double CD and vinyl in )Tj
T*(November 2005.[20] The first single from the album was "King of the Mountain", )Tj
T*(which was played for the first time on BBC Radio 2 on 21 September 2005.[58] )Tj

T*(a set of unrelated themed songs, including "King of the Mountain"; "Bertie", a )Tj
T*(Renaissance-style ode to her son; and "Joanni", based on the story of Joan of )Tj
T*(Arc. In the song "œÄ", Bush sings the number Pi to 115 decimal places.[59][60] )Tj
T*(The second disc, subtitled A Sky of Honey, features one continuous piece of )Tj
T*(music describing the experience of being outdoors after waking at dawn, moving )Tj
T*(through afternoon, dusk, to night, then back to the following dawn of single )Tj
T*(summer's day. All the pieces in this suite refer or allude to sky and sea in )Tj
T*(their lyrical content. Bush mixed her voice with cooing woodpigeons to repeat )Tj
T*(the phrases "A sea of honey, a sky of honey," and "You're full of beauty" )Tj
T*(throughout the piece, and uses recordings of actual birdsong throughout. A Sky )Tj
T*(of Honey features Rolf Harris playing the didgeridoo on one track, and )Tj
T*(providing vocals on "The Painter's Link".[59] Other artists making guest )Tj
T*(appearances on the album include Peter Erskine, Eberhard Weber, Lol Creme, and )Tj

T*( "King of the Mountain" entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six on 17 )Tj
T*(October 2005,[62] and by 30 October it had become Bush's third-highest-charting )Tj
T*(single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. Aerial entered )Tj
T*(the UK albums chart at number 3,[63] and the US chart at number¬†48.[64] Bush )Tj
T*(herself carried out relatively little publicity for the album, only conducting )Tj
T*(a handful of magazine and radio interviews. Aerial earned Bush two nominations )Tj
T*(at the 2006 BRIT Awards, for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British )Tj
T*(Album.[65] )Tj
T*( In late 2007, Bush composed and recorded a new song, "Lyra", for the )Tj
T*(soundtrack to the fantasy film The Golden Compass.[66] )Tj
T*( [edit] Director's Cut and 50 Words for Snow )Tj
T*( On 16 May 2011, Bush released the album Director's Cut. The album, which Bush )Tj
T*(has described as an entirely new project rather than a collection of mere )Tj
T*(remixes, contains 11 tracks of substantially reworked material from her earlier )Tj
T*(albums The Sensual World and The Red Shoes, all of which have been recorded )Tj
T*(using analogue, rather than digital, equipment to create "a warmer sound". All )Tj
T*(the tracks have new lead vocals, new drums, and radically reworked )Tj
T*(instrumentation. Some of them have been transposed to a lower key to )Tj
T*(accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including "This Woman's )Tj
T*(Work", have been completely re-recorded, with lyrics often changed in )Tj
T*(places.[67] The album has been met with a wide range of reviews with most )Tj
T*(reviewers a bit confused about the concept of the album itself, while )Tj
T*(responding with varying degrees of enthusiasm about its revamped tracks. Of )Tj
T*(particular note is the warmer, more intimate tone of the songs and the richer, )Tj
T*(more mature sound of her voice.[68][69] This is the first album on her new )Tj
T*(label, Fish People, a division of EMI Records, with whom she's had a )Tj
T*(relationship since she started recording. In addition to the album Director's )Tj
T*(Cut in both its single CD form and in a box-set with The Sensual World and the )Tj
T*(analogue re-mastered The Red Shoes, Fish People will be releasing re-mastered )Tj
T*(editions of The Hounds of Love and The Dreaming.[70] The album debuted at )Tj
T*(number 2 on the United Kingdom chart.[71] )Tj
T*( The song "The Sensual World" has been renamed "Flower of the Mountain" and )Tj
T*(contains a passage of Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy from James Joyce's novel )Tj
T*(Ulysses. Bush said, "Originally when I wrote the song "The Sensual World", I )Tj
T*(had used text from the end of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the )Tj
T*(text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the )Tj
T*(song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, )Tj
T*(I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would )Tj
T*(ask for permission again and this time they said yes."[72] )Tj
T*( The first single released from the album was "Deeper Understanding" and )Tj
T*(contains a new chorus featuring computerised vocals from Bush's son, Albert. A )Tj
T*(video for the song, directed by Bush, has been released through her channel on )Tj

T*( Bush's next studio album, 50 Words for Snow, was released on 21 November 2011. )Tj
T*(The album contains seven new songs "set against a backdrop of falling snow," )Tj
T*(with a total running time of 65 minutes.[73][74] A radio edit of the first )Tj
T*(single, "Wild Man," was played on BBC Radio 2's 'Ken Bruce' show on 10 )Tj
T*(October.[75] and was released as a digital download on 11 October.[76] The )Tj
T*(album is distributed in the United States by Anti-Records. )Tj
T*( On 14 November 2011, NPR played 50 Words for Snow in its entirety for the )Tj
T*(first time.[77] Australia's ABC Radio National declared 50 Words for Snow album )Tj
T*(of the week of 12 November 2011.[78] )Tj
T*( The album's songs are built around Bush's quietly jazzy piano and Steve Gadd's )Tj
T*(drums, and utilise both sung and spoken word vocals in what Classic Rock's )Tj
T*(Stephen Dalton calls "a...supple and experimental affair, with a comtemporary )Tj
T*(chamber pop sound grounded in crisp piano, minimal percussion and light-touch )Tj
T*(electronics...billowing jazz-rock soundscapes, interwoven with fragmentary )Tj
T*(narratives delivered in a range of voices from shrill to Laurie Anderson-style )Tj
T*(cooing."[79] Bassist Danny Thompson appears on the album, which also features )Tj
T*(performances by Elton John and actor Stephen Fry. )Tj
T*( On the first track, "Snowflake," in a song written specifically to use his )Tj
T*(still high choir-boy voice,[80] Bush's son Albert \(Bertie\) sings the role of a )Tj
T*(falling snowflake in a song expressing the hope of a noisy world soon being )Tj
T*(hushed by snowfall. "Snowflake" drifts into "Lake Tahoe", where choral singer )Tj
T*(Stefan Roberts and Bush sing about a rarely seen ghost: a woman who appears in )Tj
T*(a Victorian gown to call to her dog, Snowflake. Bush explained to fellow )Tj
T*(musician Jamie Cullum in an interview on Dutch Radio[81] that she wished to )Tj
T*(explore using high male voices in contrast to her own, deeper, voice. "Misty" )Tj
T*(is about a snowman lover who melts away after a night of passion, while "Wild )Tj
T*(Man" tells the story of a group of climbers in the Himalayas who, upon finding )Tj
T*(evidence of a nearby Yeti, erase all traces of it to protect it from discovery. )Tj
T*(Elton John and Bush as eternally divided lovers trade vocals on "Snowed In at )Tj
T*(Wheeler Street", while Stephen Fry recites the "50 Words for Snow". The quiet )Tj

T*( 50 Words for Snow received general acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, )Tj
T*(which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream )Tj
T*(critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 26 reviews, which )Tj
T*(indicates "universal acclaim".[83] She was nominated for a Brit Award in the )Tj
T*("Best Female Artist" category,[84] and the album won the 2012 Best Album at the )Tj
T*(South Bank Arts Awards,[85] and was also nominated for Best Album at the Ivor )Tj
T*(Novello Awards.[86] )Tj
T*( Bush turned down an invitation by the organizers of the 2012 Summer Olympics )Tj
T*(closing ceremony to perform at the event. Instead a recording of a new remix of )Tj
T*(her 1985 hit "Running Up that Hill" was played at the end of the ceremony.[87] )Tj
T*(The remix which was released on 12 August 2012 was based on the 1985 12" single )Tj

T*(current lower vocal range. The remix entered the UK Singles Chart at number 6 )Tj
T*(the following week.[88] )Tj

T*( Bush is a soprano[89] with a range going from B2 \(sung in the 2012 version of )Tj
T*("Running Up That Hill"\) to D7 \(screamed in "The Big Sky"\).[90] Her music is )Tj
T*(eclectic, varying styles even within an album. Her songs span genres as diverse )Tj
T*(as rock, pop, alternative and art rock.[1] Even in her earliest works where the )Tj
T*(piano was a primary instrument, she wove together many diverse influences, )Tj
T*(melding classical music, rock, and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources, and )Tj
T*(this has continued throughout her career. )Tj
T*( In an interview with Melody Maker magazine in 1977, she revealed that male )Tj
T*(artists had more influence on her work than females, stating: "Every female you )Tj

T*(music‚Äînot all of it but the good stuff‚Äîreally lays it on you. It really puts )Tj

T*( The experimental nature of her music has led it to be described as a later, )Tj
T*(more technological, and more accessible manifestation of the British )Tj
T*(progressive rock movement.[2][17] Southern England was the home to the most )Tj
T*(influential and successful acts of the progressive rock movement and,[2] like )Tj
T*(other artists in this genre, Bush rejects the classic American style of making )Tj
T*(pop music, which was adopted by most UK pop artists. Bush's vocals contain )Tj
T*(elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently \(southern\) English )Tj
T*(accents and, in its utilisation of musical instruments from many periods and )Tj
T*(cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms.[2] Elements of Bush's )Tj
T*(lyrics tend to be more unusual and less clich√©d than American-style pop lyrics, )Tj
T*(often employing historical or literary references and avoiding autobiographical )Tj
T*(lyrics. She considers herself a storyteller who embodies the character singing )Tj
T*(the song and strenuously rejects efforts by others to insist that her songs are )Tj
T*(autobiographical.[2][91][92] )Tj
T*( Reviewers have used the term "surreal" to describe her music.[93] Many of her )Tj
T*(songs have a melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy )Tj
T*(categorisation.[94] It has been observed that even the more joyous pieces are )Tj
T*(often tinged with traces of melancholy, and even the most sorrowful pieces have )Tj
T*(elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress them.[95] )Tj
T*( Her lyrics have referenced a wide array of subject matter, often relatively )Tj
T*(obscure, as in G. I. Gurdjieff in the song "Them Heavy People", while "Deeper )Tj
T*(Understanding", from The Sensual World, portrays a person who stays indoors, )Tj
T*(obsessively talking to a computer and shunning human contact. "Cloudbusting" )Tj
T*(was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, "Book of Dreams", about his )Tj
T*(relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich. In a retrospective review of )Tj
T*("Cloudbusting", Allmusic journalist Amy Hanson praised the song for "the rich )Tj
T*(earth of imagery that Bush has tilled throughout her entire career, emerging )Tj
T*(both tender and brutal." Commending the song for having "a thoughtful lyric and )Tj
T*(a compulsive cello-driven melody", Hanson wrote: "Even more startling, but )Tj
T*(hardly surprising, is the ease with which Bush was able to capture the moment )Tj
T*(when a child first realizes that adults are fallible and the parental cocoon is )Tj
T*(tenuous at best."[96] )Tj
T*( Comedy is also a big influence on her and is a significant component of her )Tj
T*(work. She has cited Woody Allen,[97]Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and The Young )Tj
T*(Ones[98] as particular favourites. Horror movies are another interest of Bush's )Tj
T*(and have influenced the gothic nature of several of her songs, such as "Hounds )Tj
T*(of Love", inspired by the 1957 horror movie Night of the Demon.[99] Her songs )Tj
T*(have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as )Tj
T*(murder by poisoning in "Coffee Homeground", an alcoholic mother in "Ran Tan )Tj
T*(Waltz" and the upbeat "The Wedding List", a song inspired by Fran√ßois )Tj
T*(Truffaut's 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich's The Bride Wore Black about the death )Tj
T*(of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer.[100] )Tj
T*( In 1983 New Musical Express noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle what was )Tj
T*(described as sensitive and taboo subjects.[101] "The Kick Inside" is based on a )Tj
T*(traditional English folk song \(The Ballad of Lucy Wan\) about an incestuous )Tj
T*(pregnancy and a resulting suicide.[102] "Kashka from Baghdad" is a song about a )Tj
T*(homosexual male couple;[103]Out magazine listed two of her albums in their Top )Tj
T*(100 Greatest Gayest albums list.[104]The Infant Kiss" is a song about a )Tj
T*(haunted, unstable woman's almost pedophile infatuation with a young boy in her )Tj
T*(care \(inspired by Jack Clayton's film The Innocents \(1961\), which had been )Tj
T*(based on Henry James's famous novella The Turn of the Screw\);[105][106] and )Tj

T*( [edit] Length of time between albums and perception of perfectionism )Tj
T*( The length of time in between album releases has led to rumours in the media )Tj
T*(concerning her health or appearance.[98] In the past, stories of weight gain or )Tj
T*(mental instability have been disproved by Bush's periodic reappearance.[108] In )Tj
T*(2011 Bush told BBC Radio 4 that the amount of time between album releases is )Tj

T*( [edit] Live performances )Tj
T*( Bush's only tour took place 2 April ‚Äì 13 May 1979, after which she has given )Tj
T*(only the occasional live performance. Several reasons have been suggested as to )Tj
T*(why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control )Tj
T*(of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance, a )Tj
T*(rumour of a crippling fear of flying,[109] and the suggestion that the death of )Tj
T*(21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her. Duffield, her lighting )Tj
T*(director, was killed in an accident during her 2 April 1979 concert at Poole )Tj
T*(Arts Centre. Bush held a benefit concert on 12 May 1979, with Peter Gabriel and )Tj
T*(Steve Harley at London's Hammersmith Odeon for his family. Duffield would be )Tj
T*(honoured in two later songs: "Blow Away" on Never for Ever and "Moments of )Tj
T*(Pleasure" on The Red Shoes. Bush explained in a BBC Radio 2 interview with Mark )Tj
T*(Radcliffe that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing )Tj
T*(her subsequent records. A BBC film crew followed the preparation for the tour )Tj
T*(which was shown on the BBC Nationwide program as a 30 minute special. )Tj
T*( During the same period as her tour, she made numerous television appearances )Tj
T*(around the world, including Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom, Bios Bahnhof )Tj
T*(in Germany, and Saturday Night Live in the United States \(with Paul Shaffer on )Tj
T*(piano\).[110] On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the Kate Bush Christmas Special. )Tj
T*(It was recorded in October 1979 at the BBC Studios in Birmingham, England; )Tj
T*(choreography by Anthony Van Laast.[111] As well as playing songs from her first )Tj
T*(two albums, she played "December Will Be Magic Again", and "Violin" from her )Tj
T*(forthcoming album, Never for Ever. Peter Gabriel made a guest appearance to )Tj
T*(play "Here Comes the Flood", and a duet of Roy Harper's "Another Day" with )Tj
T*(Bush.[112] )Tj
T*( After the Tour of Life Bush desired to make two more albums before touring )Tj
T*(again. At that point she got involved with production techniques and sound )Tj
T*(experimentation that took up a lot of time and prevented her from touring. )Tj
T*(Later on there were a couple of instances where she came close to touring )Tj
T*(again.[113] )Tj
T*( In 1982, Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of The Prince's )Tj
T*(Trust alongside artists such as Madness, Midge Ure, Phil Collins, Mick Karn and )Tj
T*(Pete Townshend. On 25 April 1986 Bush performed live for British charity event )Tj

T*(a rendition of "Breathing". Later in the year on 28 June 1986, she made a guest )Tj
T*(appearance to duet with Peter Gabriel on "Don't Give Up" at Earl's Court, )Tj
T*(London as part of his "So" tour. In March 1987, Bush sang "Running Up that )Tj
T*(Hill" at The Secret Policeman's Third Ball accompanied by David Gilmour. )Tj

T*( Minnesota \(i/m…™n…®Ààso ät…ô/\)[4] is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United )Tj
T*(States. Minnesota was carved out of the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory )Tj
T*(and admitted to the Union as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858. Known as the "Land )Tj
T*(of 10,000 Lakes", the state's name comes from a Dakota word for "sky-tinted )Tj
T*(water". Those waters, together with forests, parks, and wilderness areas, offer )Tj
T*(residents and tourists a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities. )Tj
T*( Minnesota is the 12th most extensive and the 21st most populous of the U.S. )Tj
T*(states. Nearly 60% of its residents live in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul )Tj
T*(metropolitan area \(known as the "Twin Cities"\), the center of transportation, )Tj
T*(business, industry, education, government and home to an internationally known )Tj
T*(arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now )Tj
T*(given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now )Tj
T*(cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for )Tj
T*(mining, forestry, and recreation. )Tj
T*( Minnesota is known for its relatively mixed social and political orientations, )Tj
T*(and has a high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Minnesota ranks )Tj
T*(among the healthiest states, and has a highly literate population. The large )Tj
T*(majority of residents are of Scandinavian and German descent. The state is )Tj
T*(known as a center of Scandinavian American culture. Ethnic diversity has )Tj
T*(increased in recent decades. Substantial influxes of Asian, African, and Latin )Tj
T*(American immigrants have joined the descendants of European immigrants and the )Tj
T*(original Native American inhabitants. )Tj
T*( [edit] Etymology )Tj
T*( The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: )Tj
T*(Mnisota. The root mni \(also spelled mini or minne\) means, "water". Mnisota can )Tj
T*(be translated as sky-tinted water or somewhat clouded water.[4][5]Native )Tj
T*(Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water )Tj
T*(and calling it mnisota.[5] Many locations in the state have similar names, such )Tj
T*(as Minnehaha Falls \("waterfall"\), Minneiska \("white water"\), Minneota \("much )Tj
T*(water"\), Minnetonka \("big water"\), Minnetrista \("crooked water"\), and )Tj
T*(Minneapolis, which is a combination of mni and polis, the Greek word for )Tj
T*("city".[6] )Tj

T*( In more recent times, massive ice sheets at least one kilometer thick ravaged )Tj
T*(the landscape of the state and sculpted its current terrain.[10] The Wisconsin )Tj
T*(glaciation left 12,000 years ago.[10] These glaciers covered all of Minnesota )Tj
T*(except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that )Tj
T*(cut into the bedrock. This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence )Tj
T*(of glacial drift.[13] Much of the remainder of the state outside of the )Tj

T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( Before European settlement of North America, Minnesota was populated by the )Tj

T*(away from them caused migration of the Anishinaabe and other Native Americans )Tj
T*(into the Minnesota area. The first Europeans in the area were French fur )Tj
T*(traders who arrived in the 17th century. Late that century, Anishinaabe, also )Tj
T*(known as Ojibwe Indians migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with )Tj
T*(the Dakota people.[31] Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, )Tj
T*(Father Louis Hennepin, Jonathan Carver, Henry Schoolcraft, and Joseph Nicollet, )Tj
T*(among others, mapped out the state. )Tj
T*( The portion of the state east of the Mississippi River became part of the )Tj

T*(settled near the fort. In 1839, the Army forced them to move downriver and they )Tj
T*(settled in the area that became St. Paul.[34]Minnesota Territory was formed on )Tj
T*(March 3, 1849. Thousands of people had come to build farms and cut timber, and )Tj
T*(Minnesota became the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858. )Tj
T*( Treaties between European settlers and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced )Tj
T*(the natives off their lands and on to smaller reservations. As conditions )Tj
T*(deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the Dakota War of )Tj
T*(1862.[35] The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota ‚Äî the )Tj
T*(largest mass execution in United States history ‚Äî and the exile of most of the )Tj
T*(rest of the Dakota to the Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory.[32] As )Tj
T*(many as 800 white settlers died during the war.[36] )Tj
T*( Logging and farming were mainstays of Minnesota's early economy. The sawmills )Tj
T*(at Saint Anthony Falls, and logging centers like Marine on St. Croix, )Tj
T*(Stillwater, and Winona, processed high volumes of lumber. These cities were )Tj
T*(situated on rivers that were ideal for transportation.[32] Later, Saint Anthony )Tj
T*(Falls was tapped to provide power for flour mills. Innovations by Minneapolis )Tj
T*(millers led to the production of Minnesota "patent" flour, which commanded )Tj
T*(almost double the price of "bakers" or "clear" flour, which it replaced.[37] By )Tj
T*(1900, Minnesota mills, led by Pillsbury, Northwestern and the Washburn-Crosby )Tj
T*(Company \(a forerunner of General Mills\), were grinding 14.1% of the nation's )Tj
T*(grain.[38] )Tj
T*( The state's iron-mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in )Tj
T*(the Vermilion Range and the Mesabi Range in the 1880s, and in the Cuyuna Range )Tj
T*(in the early 20th century. The ore was shipped by rail to Duluth and Two )Tj
T*(Harbors, then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the Great )Tj
T*(Lakes.[32] )Tj
T*( Industrial development and the rise of manufacturing caused the population to )Tj
T*(shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. )Tj
T*(Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by )Tj
T*(the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron )Tj
T*(miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the )Tj
T*(Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some )Tj
T*(economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around )Tj
T*(the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the )Tj
T*(Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of )Tj
T*(self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and )Tj
T*(promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and )Tj
T*(native languages were no longer suppressed.[33] )Tj
T*( After World War II, industrial development quickened. New technology increased )Tj
T*(farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine )Tj
T*(milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting )Tj
T*(became more specialized with hybridization of corn and wheat, and the use of )Tj
T*(farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of )Tj
T*(Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of )Tj

T*( The state produces ethanol fuel and is the first to mandate its use, a 10% mix )Tj
T*(\(E10\).[66] In 2005 there were more than 310 service stations supplying E85 )Tj
T*(fuel, comprising 85&amp; ethanol and 15% gasoline.[67] A 2% biodiesel blend has )Tj

T*(and another 200¬†megawatts planned, much of it on the windy Buffalo Ridge in the )Tj
T*(southwest part of the state.[68] )Tj
T*( [edit] State taxes )Tj
T*( Minnesota has a progressive income tax structure; the three brackets of state )Tj
T*(income tax rates are 5.35%, 7.05% and 7.85%.[69] As of 2008, Minnesota was )Tj
T*(ranked as 12th in the nation for per capita total state and local taxes.[70] In )Tj
T*(2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2% of their income in state and local taxes, compared )Tj
T*(to the US average of 9.7% of income.[70] This ranks Minnesota 12th among the )Tj
T*(states for total state and local tax burden.[70] The state sales tax in )Tj
T*(Minnesota is 6.875%, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug )Tj
T*(medications, some services, or food items for home consumption.[71] The state )Tj
T*(legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special )Tj
T*(local taxes, such as the 0.5% supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis.[72]Excise )Tj
T*(taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use )Tj

T*(activities; the state is ranked first in the percentage of residents who engage )Tj
T*(in regular exercise.[77] )Tj
T*( Minnesotans have low rates of premature death, infant mortality, )Tj
T*(cardiovascular disease, and occupational fatalities,[78][79] long life )Tj
T*(expectancies,[80] and a high rate of health insurance.[78][81] These and other )Tj
T*(measures have led two groups to rank Minnesota as the healthiest state in the )Tj
T*(nation, but in one of these rankings Minnesota descended from first to sixth in )Tj
T*(the nation between 2005 and 2009, due to low levels of public health funding )Tj
T*(and prevalence of binge drinking.[78][82] )Tj
T*( On October 1, 2007 Minnesota became the seventeenth state to enact a statewide )Tj
T*(smoking ban in restaurants and bars with the enactment of Freedom to Breathe )Tj
T*(Act.[83] )Tj
T*( Medical care is provided by a comprehensive network of hospitals and clinics, )Tj
T*(headed by two institutions with international reputations. The University of )Tj
T*(Minnesota Medical School is a highly rated teaching institution that has made a )Tj
T*(number of breakthroughs in treatment, and its research activities contribute )Tj
T*(significantly to the state's growing biotechnology industry.[84] The Mayo )Tj
T*(Clinic, a world-renowned medical practice, is based in Rochester. Mayo and the )Tj
T*(University are partners in the Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and )Tj
T*(Medical Genomics, a state-funded program that conducts research into cancer, )Tj
T*(Alzheimer's disease, heart health, obesity, and other areas.[85] )Tj
T*( [edit] Education )Tj
T*( One of the first acts of the Minnesota Legislature when it opened in 1858 was )Tj
T*(the creation of a normal school at Winona. This commitment to education has )Tj
T*(contributed to a literate and well-educated population;[86] the state ranked )Tj
T*(13th on the 2006‚Äì2007 Morgan Quitno Smartest State Award, and is first in the )Tj
T*(percentage of residents with at least a high school diploma.[87][88] But while )Tj

T*(of African American, 30% of Asian American and more than 34% of Hispanic and )Tj
T*(Native American students dropped out of school.[89] In 2007 Minnesota students )Tj

T*(first charter school.[92] )Tj
T*( The state supports a network of public universities and colleges, including 32 )Tj
T*(institutions in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, and five )Tj
T*(major campuses of the University of Minnesota. It is also home to more than 20 )Tj

T*( [edit] Law and government )Tj
T*( As with the federal government of the United States, power in Minnesota is )Tj
T*(divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.[101] )Tj
T*( [edit] Executive )Tj
T*( The executive branch is headed by the governor. Governor Mark Dayton, a )Tj
T*(Democrat, took office on January 3, 2011, to become the first Democratic )Tj
T*(Governor to hold the seat in two decades. The governor has a cabinet consisting )Tj
T*(of the leaders of various state government agencies, called commissioners. The )Tj
T*(other elected constitutional offices are secretary of state, attorney general, )Tj
T*(and state auditor. )Tj
T*( [edit] Legislature )Tj
T*( The Minnesota Legislature is a bicameral body consisting of the Senate and the )Tj
T*(House of Representatives. The state has sixty-seven districts, each covering )Tj
T*(about sixty thousand people. Each district has one senator and two )Tj
T*(representatives \(each district being divided into A and B sections\). Senators )Tj
T*(serve for four years and representatives for two years. In the November 2010 )Tj
T*(election, the Minnesota Republican Party gained twenty-five house seats, giving )Tj
T*(them control of the House of Representatives by a 72-62 margin.[102] The 2010 )Tj
T*(election also saw Minnesota voters elect a Republican majority in the Senate )Tj
T*(for the first time since 1972. )Tj
T*( [edit] Judiciary )Tj
T*( Minnesota's court system has three levels. Most cases start in the district )Tj
T*(courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court )Tj
T*(judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and )Tj
T*(challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the Minnesota Court )Tj
T*(of Appeals, consisting of nineteen judges who typically sit in three-judge )Tj
T*(panels. The seven-justice Minnesota Supreme Court hears all appeals from the )Tj
T*(Tax Court, the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals, first-degree murder )Tj
T*(convictions, and discretionary appeals from the Court of Appeals; it also has )Tj
T*(original jurisdiction over election disputes.[103] )Tj
T*( Two specialized courts within administrative agencies have been established: )Tj
T*(the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court, which deals with )Tj
T*(non-criminal tax cases. )Tj
T*( [edit] Regional )Tj
T*( In addition to the city and county levels of government found in the United )Tj
T*(States, Minnesota has other entities that provide governmental oversight and )Tj
T*(planning. Some actions in the Twin Cities metropolitan area are coordinated by )Tj
T*(the Metropolitan Council, and many lakes and rivers are overseen by watershed )Tj

T*( [edit] Politics )Tj
T*( Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a )Tj
T*(longstanding force among the state's political parties.[107][108] Minnesota has )Tj
T*(a consistently high voter turnout \(due in part to its liberal voter )Tj
T*(registration laws\) "with virtually no evidence of unlawful voting".[109] In the )Tj
T*(2008 U.S. presidential election, 77.9% of eligible Minnesotans voted‚Äîthe )Tj
T*(highest percentage of any U.S. state‚Äîversus the national average of 61.2%.[110] )Tj
T*(Previously unregistered voters can register on election day at their polls with )Tj
T*(evidence of residency.[111] )Tj
T*( Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at )Tj
T*(the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Eugene McCarthy's anti-war stance and )Tj
T*(popularity in the 1968 New Hampshire primary likely convinced Lyndon B. Johnson )Tj
T*(to drop out of the presidential election. Minnesotans have consistently cast )Tj
T*(their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since )Tj
T*(1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation )Tj
T*(that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. )Tj
T*(Minnesota has gone to the Democratic Party in every Presidential Election since )Tj
T*(1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the )Tj
T*(Republican Party. )Tj
T*( Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major party status in )Tj
T*(Minnesota, but its state-level "Democratic" party is actually a separate party, )Tj
T*(officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party \(DFL\). Formed )Tj
T*(out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties, )Tj
T*(the DFL now serves as a de facto proxy to the federal Democratic Party, and its )Tj
T*(distinction from the Democratic Party, while still official, is now a )Tj
T*(functional technicality. )Tj
T*( The state has had active third party movements. The Reform Party, now the )Tj
T*(Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and )Tj
T*(professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The )Tj
T*(Independence Party has received enough support to keep major party status. The )Tj
T*(Green Party, while no longer having major party status, has a large presence in )Tj
T*(municipal government,[112] notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes )Tj
T*(directly with the DFL party for local offices. Official "Major party" status in )Tj
T*(Minnesota \(which grants state funding for elections\) is reserved to parties )Tj
T*(whose candidates receive 5% or more of the vote in any statewide election )Tj
T*(\(e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President\). )Tj
T*( The state's U.S. Senate seats have generally been split since the early 1990s, )Tj
T*(and in the 108th and 109th Congresses, Minnesota's congressional delegation was )Tj
T*(split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 )Tj
T*(midterm election, Democrats were elected to all state offices except for )Tj
T*(governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans Tim Pawlenty and Carol )Tj
T*(Molnau narrowly won re-election. The DFL also posted double-digit gains in both )Tj
T*(houses of the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and )Tj
T*(increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison \(DFL\) was elected )Tj
T*(as the first African American U.S. Representative from Minnesota as well as the )Tj
T*(first Muslim elected to Congress nationwide.[113] In 2008 DFLer and former )Tj
T*(comedian and radio talk show host Al Franken beat incumbent Republican Norm )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*(  Another form of this proof multiplies 1‚ÅÑ3 = 0.333‚Ä¶ by 3. )Tj
T*( [edit] Digit manipulation )Tj
T*( When a number in decimal notation is multiplied by 10, the digits do not )Tj
T*(change but each digit moves one place to the left. Thus 10¬†√ó¬†0.999... equals )Tj
T*(9.999..., which is 9 greater than the original number. To see this, consider )Tj
T*(that in subtracting 0.999... from 9.999..., each of the digits after the )Tj
T*(decimal separator cancels, i.e. the result is 9¬†‚àí¬†9¬†=¬†0 for each such digit. )Tj
T*(The final step uses algebra: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Discussion )Tj
T*( Although these proofs demonstrate that 0.999...¬†=¬†1, the extent to which they )Tj
T*(explain the equation depends on the audience. In introductory arithmetic, such )Tj
T*(proofs help explain why 0.999...¬†=¬†1 but 0.333...¬†&lt;¬†0.4. And in introductory )Tj
T*(algebra, the proofs help explain why the general method of converting between )Tj
T*(fractions and repeating decimals works. But the proofs shed little light on the )Tj
T*(fundamental relationship between decimals and the numbers they represent, which )Tj
T*(underlies the question of how two different decimals can be said to be equal at )Tj
T*(all.[1] William Byers argues that a student who agrees that 0.999...¬†=¬†1 )Tj
T*(because of the above proofs, but hasn't resolved the ambiguity, doesn't really )Tj
T*(understand the equation.[2] Fred Richman argues that the first argument "gets )Tj
T*(its force from the fact that most people have been indoctrinated to accept the )Tj
T*(first equation without thinking".[3] )Tj
T*( Once a representation scheme is defined, it can be used to justify the rules )Tj
T*(of decimal arithmetic used in the above proofs. Moreover, one can directly )Tj
T*(demonstrate that the decimals 0.999... and 1.000... both represent the same )Tj
T*(real number; it is built into the definition. This is done below. )Tj
T*( [edit] Analytic proofs )Tj
T*( Since the question of 0.999... does not affect the formal development of )Tj
T*(mathematics, it can be postponed until one proves the standard theorems of real )Tj
T*(analysis. One requirement is to characterize real numbers that can be written )Tj
T*(in decimal notation, consisting of an optional sign, a finite sequence of any )Tj
T*(number of digits forming an integer part, a decimal separator, and a sequence )Tj
T*(of digits forming a fractional part. For the purpose of discussing 0.999..., )Tj
T*(the integer part can be summarized as b0 and one can neglect negatives, so a )Tj
T*(decimal expansion has the form )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(  It should be noted that the fraction part, unlike the integer part, is not )Tj
T*(limited to a finite number of digits. This is a positional notation, so for )Tj
T*(example the 5 in 500 contributes ten times as much as the 5 in 50, and the 5 in )Tj
T*(0.05 contributes one tenth as much as the 5 in 0.5. )Tj
T*( [edit] Infinite series and sequences )Tj
T*( Perhaps the most common development of decimal expansions is to define them as )Tj
T*(sums of infinite series. In general: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(  For 0.999... one can apply the convergence theorem concerning geometric )Tj
T*(series:[4] )Tj
T*( If then )Tj

T*(the same maneuver on 0.999...[6] A 19th-century reaction against such liberal )Tj
T*(summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today: the )Tj
T*(sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums. )Tj
T*(A corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence; it can )Tj
T*(be found in any proof-based introduction to calculus or analysis.[7] )Tj
T*( A sequence \(x0, x1, x2, ...\) has a limit x if the distance |x¬†‚àí¬†xn| becomes )Tj
T*(arbitrarily small as n increases. The statement that 0.999...¬†=¬†1 can itself be )Tj
T*(interpreted and proven as a limit:[8] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(  The last step, that 1‚ÅÑ10n ‚Üí 0 as n ‚Üí ‚àû, is often justified by the Archimedean )Tj
T*(property of the real numbers. This limit-based attitude towards 0.999... is )Tj
T*(often put in more evocative but less precise terms. For example, the 1846 )Tj
T*(textbook The University Arithmetic explains, ".999 +, continued to infinity = )Tj
T*(1, because every annexation of a 9 brings the value closer to 1"; the 1895 )Tj
T*(Arithmetic for Schools says, "...when a large number of 9s is taken, the )Tj
T*(difference between 1 and .99999... becomes inconceivably small".[9] Such )Tj
T*(heuristics are often interpreted by students as implying that 0.999... itself )Tj
T*(is less than 1. )Tj
T*( [edit] Nested intervals and least upper bounds )Tj
T*( The series definition above is a simple way to define the real number named by )Tj
T*(a decimal expansion. A complementary approach is tailored to the opposite )Tj
T*(process: for a given real number, define the decimal expansion\(s\) to name it. )Tj
T*( If a real number x is known to lie in the closed interval [0, 10] \(i.e., it is )Tj
T*(greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10\), one can imagine )Tj
T*(dividing that interval into ten pieces that overlap only at their endpoints: )Tj
T*([0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], and so on up to [9, 10]. The number x must belong to )Tj
T*(one of these; if it belongs to [2, 3] then one records the digit "2" and )Tj
T*(subdivides that interval into [2, 2.1], [2.1, 2.2], ..., [2.8, 2.9], [2.9, 3]. )Tj
T*(Continuing this process yields an infinite sequence of nested intervals, )Tj
T*(labeled by an infinite sequence of digits b0, b1, b2, b3, ..., and one writes )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(  In this formalism, the identities 1¬†=¬†0.999... and 1¬†=¬†1.000... reflect, )Tj
T*(respectively, the fact that 1 lies in both [0, 1] and [1, 2], so one can choose )Tj
T*(either subinterval when finding its digits. To ensure that this notation does )Tj
T*(not abuse the "=" sign, one needs a way to reconstruct a unique real number for )Tj
T*(each decimal. This can be done with limits, but other constructions continue )Tj
T*(with the ordering theme.[10] )Tj
T*( One straightforward choice is the nested intervals theorem, which guarantees )Tj
T*(that given a sequence of nested, closed intervals whose lengths become )Tj
T*(arbitrarily small, the intervals contain exactly one real number in their )Tj
T*(intersection. So b0.b1b2b3... is defined to be the unique number contained )Tj
T*(within all the intervals [b0, b0 + 1], [b0.b1, b0.b1 + 0.1], and so on. )Tj
T*(0.999... is then the unique real number that lies in all of the intervals [0, )Tj
T*(1], [0.9, 1], [0.99, 1], and [0.99...9, 1] for every finite string of 9s. Since )Tj
T*(1 is an element of each of these intervals, 0.999... = 1.[11] )Tj
T*( The Nested Intervals Theorem is usually founded upon a more fundamental )Tj

T*(give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational )Tj
T*(numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, )Tj
T*(subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, )Tj
T*(so that one number can be compared to another and found to be less than, )Tj
T*(greater than, or equal to another number. )Tj
T*( The step from rationals to reals is a major extension. There are at least two )Tj
T*(popular ways to achieve this step, both published in 1872: Dedekind cuts and )Tj
T*(Cauchy sequences. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these )Tj
T*(constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern )Tj
T*(trend for the last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when )Tj
T*(a construction is offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of )Tj
T*(the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors )Tj
T*(express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically )Tj
T*(appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more self-contained.[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Dedekind cuts )Tj
T*( In the Dedekind cut approach, each real number x is defined as the infinite )Tj
T*(set of all rational numbers less than x.[15] In particular, the real number 1 )Tj
T*(is the set of all rational numbers that are less than 1.[16] Every positive )Tj
T*(decimal expansion easily determines a Dedekind cut: the set of rational numbers )Tj
T*(which are less than some stage of the expansion. So the real number 0.999... is )Tj
T*(the set of rational numbers r such that r &lt; 0, or r &lt; 0.9, or r &lt; )Tj
T*(0.99, or r is less than some other number of the form )Tj
T*( .[17])Tj
T*(  Every element of 0.999... is less than 1, so it is an element of the real )Tj
T*(number 1. Conversely, an element of 1 is a rational number )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(  which implies )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(  Since 0.999... and 1 contain the same rational numbers, they are the same )Tj
T*(set: 0.999... = 1. )Tj
T*( The definition of real numbers as Dedekind cuts was first published by Richard )Tj
T*(Dedekind in 1872.[18] The above approach to assigning a real number to each )Tj
T*(decimal expansion is due to an expository paper titled "Is 0.999 ... = 1?" by )Tj
T*(Fred Richman in Mathematics Magazine, which is targeted at teachers of )Tj
T*(collegiate mathematics, especially at the junior/senior level, and their )Tj
T*(students.[19] Richman notes that taking Dedekind cuts in any dense subset of )Tj
T*(the rational numbers yields the same results; in particular, he uses decimal )Tj
T*(fractions, for which the proof is more immediate. He also notes that typically )Tj
T*(the definitions allow { x¬†: x &lt; 1 } to be a cut but not { x¬†: x ‚â§ 1 } \(or )Tj
T*(vice versa\) "Why do that? Precisely to rule out the existence of distinct )Tj
T*(numbers 0.9* and 1. [...] So we see that in the traditional definition of the )Tj
T*(real numbers, the equation 0.9* = 1 is built in at the beginning."[20] A )Tj
T*(further modification of the procedure leads to a different structure where the )Tj
T*(two are not equal. Although it is consistent, many of the common rules of )Tj
T*(decimal arithmetic no longer hold, for example the fraction 1/3 has no )Tj
T*(representation; see "Alternative number systems" below. )Tj
T*( [edit] Cauchy sequences )Tj
T*( Another approach is to define a real number as the limit of a Cauchy sequence )Tj
T*(of rational numbers. This construction of the real numbers uses the ordering of )Tj
T*(rationals less directly. First, the distance between x and y is defined as the )Tj
T*(absolute value |x¬†‚àí¬†y|, where the absolute value |z| is defined as the maximum )Tj
T*(of z and ‚àíz, thus never negative. Then the reals are defined to be the )Tj
T*(sequences of rationals that have the Cauchy sequence property using this )Tj

T*( [edit] Generalizations )Tj
T*( The result that 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every )Tj
T*(nonzero number with a finite decimal notation \(equivalently, endless trailing )Tj
T*(0s\) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, )Tj
T*(exactly as in the special case considered. These numbers are exactly the )Tj
T*(decimal fractions, and they are dense.[25] )Tj
T*( Second, a comparable theorem applies in each radix or base. For example, in )Tj
T*(base 2 \(the binary numeral system\) 0.111... equals 1, and in base 3 \(the )Tj
T*(ternary numeral system\) 0.222... equals 1. Textbooks of real analysis are )Tj
T*(likely to skip the example of 0.999... and present one or both of these )Tj
T*(generalizations from the start.[26] )Tj
T*( Alternative representations of 1 also occur in non-integer bases. For example, )Tj
T*(in the golden ratio base, the two standard representations are 1.000... and )Tj
T*(0.101010..., and there are infinitely many more representations that include )Tj
T*(adjacent 1s. Generally, for almost all q between 1 and 2, there are uncountably )Tj
T*(many base-q expansions of 1. On the other hand, there are still uncountably )Tj
T*(many q \(including all natural numbers greater than 1\) for which there is only )Tj
T*(one base-q expansion of 1, other than the trivial 1.000.... This result was )Tj
T*(first obtained by Paul Erd≈ës, Miklos Horv√°th, and Istv√°n Jo√≥ around 1990. In )Tj

T*( A more far-reaching generalization addresses the most general positional )Tj

T*(number theory. In 1802, H. Goodwin published an observation on the appearance )Tj
T*(of 9s in the repeating-decimal representations of fractions whose denominators )Tj
T*(are certain prime numbers. Examples include: )Tj
T*( 1/7 = 0.142857142857... and 142 + 857 = 999.)Tj
T*(1/73 = 0.0136986301369863... and 0136 + 9863 = 9999.)Tj
T*(  E. Midy proved a general result about such fractions, now called Midy's )Tj
T*(theorem, in 1836. The publication was obscure, and it is unclear if his proof )Tj
T*(directly involved 0.999..., but at least one modern proof by W. G. Leavitt )Tj
T*(does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive )Tj
T*(integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the )Tj
T*(theorem.[30] Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as )Tj
T*(greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group )Tj
T*(elements, and quadratic reciprocity.[31] )Tj

T*(different decimals representing the same number appears to be a paradox, which )Tj
T*(is amplified by the appearance of the seemingly well-understood number 1.[35])Tj
T*(Some students interpret "0.999..." \(or similar notation\) as a large but finite )Tj
T*(string of 9s, possibly with a variable, unspecified length. If they accept an )Tj
T*(infinite string of nines, they may still expect a last 9 "at infinity".[36])Tj
T*(Intuition and ambiguous teaching lead students to think of the limit of a )Tj

T*(sequence need not reach its limit. Where students accept the difference between )Tj

T*( Another manner in which the proofs might be undermined is if 1¬†‚àí¬†0.999... )Tj
T*(simply does not exist, because subtraction is not always possible. Mathematical )Tj
T*(structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include )Tj
T*(commutative semigroups, commutative monoids and semirings. Richman considers )Tj
T*(two such systems, designed so that 0.999... &lt; 1. )Tj
T*( First, Richman defines a nonnegative decimal number to be a literal decimal )Tj
T*(expansion. He defines the lexicographical order and an addition operation, )Tj
T*(noting that 0.999...¬†&lt;¬†1 simply because 0¬†&lt;¬†1 in the ones place, but for )Tj
T*(any nonterminating x, one has 0.999...¬†+¬†x¬†=¬†1¬†+¬†x. So one peculiarity of the )Tj
T*(decimal numbers is that addition cannot always be cancelled; another is that no )Tj
T*(decimal number corresponds to 1‚ÅÑ3. After defining multiplication, the decimal )Tj
T*(numbers form a positive, totally ordered, commutative semiring.[57] )Tj
T*( In the process of defining multiplication, Richman also defines another system )Tj
T*(he calls "cut D", which is the set of Dedekind cuts of decimal fractions. )Tj
T*(Ordinarily this definition leads to the real numbers, but for a decimal )Tj
T*(fraction d he allows both the cut \(‚àí‚àû,¬†d¬†\) and the "principal cut" \(‚àí‚àû,¬†d¬†]. )Tj
T*(The result is that the real numbers are "living uneasily together with" the )Tj
T*(decimal fractions. Again 0.999...¬†&lt;¬†1. There are no positive infinitesimals )Tj
T*(in cut D, but there is "a sort of negative infinitesimal," 0‚àí, which has no )Tj
T*(decimal expansion. He concludes that 0.999...¬†=¬†1¬†+¬†0‚àí, while the equation )Tj
T*("0.999... + x = 1" has no solution.[58] )Tj
T*( [edit] p-adic numbers )Tj
T*( Main article: p-adic number )Tj
T*( When asked about 0.999..., novices often believe there should be a "final 9," )Tj
T*(believing 1¬†‚àí¬†0.999... to be a positive number which they write as "0.000...1". )Tj
T*(Whether or not that makes sense, the intuitive goal is clear: adding a 1 to the )Tj
T*(last 9 in 0.999... would carry all the 9s into 0s and leave a 1 in the ones )Tj
T*(place. Among other reasons, this idea fails because there is no "last 9" in )Tj
T*(0.999....[59] However, there is a system that contains an infinite string of 9s )Tj
T*(including a last 9. )Tj
T*( The p-adic numbers are an alternative number system of interest in number )Tj
T*(theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the )Tj
T*(rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric )Tj
T*(in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, than it is to 1. The p-adic )Tj
T*(numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So )Tj
T*(arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals. )Tj
T*( In the 10-adic numbers, the analogues of decimal expansions run to the left. )Tj
T*(The 10-adic expansion ...999 does have a last 9, and it does not have a first )Tj
T*(9. One can add 1 to the ones place, and it leaves behind only 0s after carrying )Tj
T*(through: 1¬†+¬†...999¬†=¬†...000¬†=¬†0, and so ...999¬†=¬†‚àí1.[60] Another derivation )Tj
T*(uses a geometric series. The infinite series implied by "...999" does not )Tj
T*(converge in the real numbers, but it converges in the 10-adics, and so one can )Tj
T*(re-use the familiar formula: )Tj
T*( [61])Tj
T*(  \(Compare with the series above.\) A third derivation was invented by a )Tj
T*(seventh-grader who was doubtful over her teacher's limiting argument that )Tj
T*(0.999...¬†=¬†1 but was inspired to take the multiply-by-10 proof above in the )Tj
T*(opposite direction: if x¬†=¬†...999 then 10x¬†=¬† ...990, so 10x¬†=¬†x¬†‚àí¬†9, hence x¬†=¬†)Tj
T*(‚àí1 again.[60] )Tj
T*( As a final extension, since 0.999... = 1 \(in the reals\) and ...999 = ‚àí1 \(in )Tj
T*(the 10-adics\), then by "blind faith and unabashed juggling of symbols"[62] one )Tj
T*(may add the two equations and arrive at ...999.999... = 0. This equation does )Tj
T*(not make sense either as a 10-adic expansion or an ordinary decimal expansion, )Tj
T*(but it turns out to be meaningful and true if one develops a theory of )Tj
T*("double-decimals" with eventually repeating left ends to represent a familiar )Tj

T*( [edit] Related questions )Tj
T*( Zeno's paradoxes, particularly the paradox of the runner, are reminiscent of )Tj

T*(mathematically modelled and then, like 0.999..., resolved using a geometric )Tj

T*(Division by zero occurs in some popular discussions of 0.999..., and it also )Tj
T*(stirs up contention. While most authors choose to define 0.999..., almost all )Tj
T*(modern treatments leave division by zero undefined, as it can be given no )Tj
T*(meaning in the standard real numbers. However, division by zero is defined in )Tj
T*(some other systems, such as complex analysis, where the extended complex plane, )Tj
T*(i.e. the Riemann sphere, has a "point at infinity". Here, it makes sense to )Tj
T*(define 1/0 to be infinity;[65] and, in fact, the results are profound and )Tj
T*(applicable to many problems in engineering and physics. Some prominent )Tj
T*(mathematicians argued for such a definition long before either number system )Tj
T*(was developed.[66])Tj
T*(Negative zero is another redundant feature of many ways of writing numbers. In )Tj
T*(number systems, such as the real numbers, where "0" denotes the additive )Tj
T*(identity and is neither positive nor negative, the usual interpretation of "‚àí0" )Tj

T*("United we stand, divided we fall". )Tj
T*( Shelby's military service began when he served as second-in-command to his )Tj
T*(father at the Battle of Point Pleasant, the only major battle of Lord Dunmore's )Tj
T*(War. He gained the reputation of an expert woodsman and surveyor, and spent the )Tj
T*(early part of the Revolutionary War gathering supplies for the Continental )Tj
T*(Army. Later in the war, he and John Sevier led expeditions over the Appalachian )Tj
T*(Mountains against the British forces in North Carolina. He played a pivotal )Tj
T*(role in the British defeat at the Battle of King's Mountain. For his service, )Tj
T*(he was presented with a ceremonial sword and a pair of pistols by the North )Tj
T*(Carolina legislature, and the nickname "Old King's Mountain" followed him the )Tj
T*(rest of his life. )Tj
T*( Following the war, Shelby relocated to Kentucky on lands awarded to him for )Tj
T*(his military service and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county )Tj
T*(of Virginia to an independent state. His heroism made him popular with the )Tj
T*(citizens of the state, and the state electoral college unanimously elected him )Tj
T*(governor in 1792. He secured the state from Indian attacks and organized its )Tj
T*(first government. He leveraged the Citizen Genet affair to convince the )Tj
T*(Washington administration to make an agreement with the Spanish for free trade )Tj
T*(on the Mississippi River. )Tj
T*( At the end of his gubernatorial term, Shelby retired from public life, but he )Tj
T*(was called back into politics by the impending War of 1812. Kentuckians urged )Tj
T*(Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated )Tj
T*(conflict. He was elected easily, and at the request of General William Henry )Tj
T*(Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. At the )Tj
T*(conclusion of the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become )Tj
T*(Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, he and Andrew Jackson )Tj
T*(acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw )Tj
T*(Indian tribe. Shelby died at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky, on July )Tj
T*(18, 1826. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Isaac Shelby was born in the Province of Maryland on December 11, 1750, near )Tj
T*(Hagerstown in Frederick \(now Washington\) County.[1][2] He was the third child )Tj
T*(and second son of Evan and Letitia \(Cox\) Shelby, who immigrated from Tregaron, )Tj
T*(Wales, in 1735.[3] Though the family had historically been loyal to the Church )Tj
T*(of England, they became Presbyterians after coming to British America; this was )Tj
T*(the denomination Isaac Shelby embraced during his life.[3] )Tj
T*( Shelby was educated at the local schools in his native colony.[4] He worked on )Tj
T*(his father's plantation, and occasionally found work as a surveyor.[2] At age )Tj
T*(eighteen, he was appointed deputy sheriff of Frederick County.[3][5] Shelby's )Tj
T*(father lost a great deal of money when Pontiac's Rebellion disrupted his )Tj
T*(lucrative fur trade business, and two years later, the business' records were )Tj
T*(destroyed in a house fire.[6] Consequently in December 1770, the family moved )Tj
T*(to the area near Bristol, Tennessee, where they built a fort and a trading )Tj
T*(post.[7] Here, Shelby and his father worked for three years herding cattle.[5] )Tj
T*( During Lord Dunmore's War, a border conflict between colonists and American )Tj
T*(Indians, Shelby was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Virginia militia by )Tj
T*(Colonel William Preston.[8] As second-in-command of his father's Fincastle )Tj
T*(County company, he participated in the decisive Battle of Point Pleasant on )Tj
T*(October 10, 1774.[8] The younger Shelby earned commendation for his skill and )Tj
T*(gallantry in this battle.[2] The victorious militiamen erected Fort Blair on )Tj

T*(second-in-command, until July 1775 when Lord Dunmore ordered the fort )Tj
T*(destroyed, fearing it might become useful to colonial rebels in the growing )Tj
T*(American Revolution.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Revolutionary War )Tj
T*( After his unit was disbanded, Shelby surveyed for the Transylvania Company, a )Tj
T*(land company that had purchased much of present-day Kentucky from the Cherokees )Tj
T*(in a deal that was later invalidated by the government of Virginia.[2] After )Tj
T*(fulfilling his duties with the Transylvania Company, he rejoined his family in )Tj
T*(Virginia, but returned to Kentucky the following year to claim and improve land )Tj
T*(there for himself.[2] While there, he fell ill, and went home to recover in )Tj
T*(July 1776.[9] Back in Virginia, fighting in the American Revolutionary War was )Tj
T*(underway, and Shelby found a commission from the Virginia Committee of Safety )Tj
T*(appointing him captain of a company of Minutemen.[9] In 1777, Virginia governor )Tj
T*(Patrick Henry appointed Shelby to a position securing provisions for the army )Tj
T*(on the frontier.[9] He served a similar role for units in the Continental Army )Tj
T*(in 1778 and 1779.[9] With his own money, Shelby purchased provisions for John )Tj
T*(Sevier's 1779 expedition against the Chickamauga, a band of Cherokees who were )Tj
T*(resisting colonial expansion.[5] )Tj
T*( Shelby was elected to represent Washington County in the Virginia House of )Tj
T*(Delegates in 1779.[9] Later that year, he was commissioned a major by Governor )Tj
T*(Thomas Jefferson and charged with escorting a group of commissioners to )Tj
T*(establish a frontier boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina.[9] )Tj
T*(Shortly after his arrival in the region, North Carolina Governor Richard )Tj
T*(Caswell elevated him to the rank of colonel and made him magistrate of )Tj
T*(newly-formed Sullivan County.[10] )Tj
T*( Shelby was surveying lands in Kentucky in 1780 when he heard of the colonists' )Tj
T*(defeat at Charleston.[3] He hurried to North Carolina, where he found a request )Tj
T*(for aid from General Charles McDowell to defend the borders of North Carolina )Tj
T*(from the British.[3] Shelby assembled three hundred militiamen and joined )Tj
T*(McDowell at Cherokee Ford in South Carolina.[3] On the morning of July 31, )Tj
T*(1780, he surrounded the British stronghold at Thickety Fort on the Pacolet )Tj
T*(River with 600 men.[11] He immediately demanded a surrender, but the British )Tj
T*(refused.[12] Shelby brought his men within musket range and again demanded )Tj
T*(surrender.[12] Though the fort likely would have withstood the attack, the )Tj
T*(British commander lost his nerve and capitulated.[12] Without firing a shot, )Tj
T*(Shelby's men captured 94 prisoners.[12] )Tj
T*( Following the surrender of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans )Tj
T*(under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick )Tj
T*(Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering )Tj
T*(peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a )Tj
T*(reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back )Tj
T*(the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the )Tj
T*(colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and )Tj
T*(gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the )Tj
T*(battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they )Tj
T*(retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now )Tj
T*(safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. )Tj
T*(Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.[13] )Tj
T*( General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a )Tj
T*(British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode all night with two hundred )Tj
T*(men, reaching their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had )Tj
T*(estimated that the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout )Tj
T*(brought word that there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who )Tj
T*(were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat )Tj
T*(and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a )Tj
T*(breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift )Tj
T*(fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the )Tj
T*(British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued them back to the main )Tj
T*(colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British )Tj

T*( [edit] Battle of King's Mountain )Tj
T*( Shelby and Clarke elected not to pursue the British fleeing the Battle of )Tj
T*(Musgrove Mill.[15] Instead, they set their sights on a British fort at Ninety )Tj
T*(Six, South Carolina, where they were sure they would find Ferguson.[15] )Tj
T*(However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General )Tj
T*(Horatio Gates' defeat at the Battle of Camden.[15] With the backing of General )Tj
T*(Cornwallis, Ferguson could ride to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby )Tj
T*(retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.[16] )Tj
T*( Following the colonists' retreat, an emboldened Ferguson dispatched a paroled )Tj
T*(prisoner across the mountains to warn the colonists to cease their opposition )Tj
T*(or Ferguson would lay waste to the countryside.[17] Angered by this act, Shelby )Tj
T*(and John Sevier began to plan another raid on the British.[17] Shelby and )Tj
T*(Sevier raised 240 men each, and were joined by William Campbell with 400 from )Tj
T*(Washington County, Virginia and Charles McDowell with 160 men from Burke and )Tj
T*(Rutherford counties in North Carolina.[18] The forces mustered at Sycamore )Tj
T*(Shoals on September 25, 1780.[18] The troops crossed the difficult terrain of )Tj
T*(the Blue Ridge Mountains and arrived at McDowell's estate near Morganton, North )Tj
T*(Carolina, on September 30, 1780.[19] Here, they were joined by Colonel Benjamin )Tj
T*(Cleveland and Major Joseph Winston with 350 men from Surry and Wilkes )Tj
T*(counties.[19] )Tj
T*( The combined force pursued Ferguson to King's Mountain, where he had fortified )Tj
T*(himself, declaring that "God Almighty and all the rebels out of hell" could not )Tj
T*(move him from it.[20] The Battle of Kings Mountain commenced October 7, 1780. )Tj
T*(Shelby had ordered his men to advance from tree to tree, firing from behind )Tj
T*(each one; he called this technique "Indian play" because he had seen the )Tj
T*(Indians use it in his previous battles with them. Ferguson ordered bayonet )Tj
T*(charges that forced Shelby's men to fall back on three separate occasions, but )Tj
T*(eventually the colonists dislodged Ferguson's men from their position. Seeing )Tj
T*(the battle was lost, Ferguson and his key officers attempted a retreat. The )Tj
T*(colonists were instructed to kill Ferguson. Simultaneous shots by Sevier's men )Tj
T*(broke both Ferguson's arms, fatally pierced his skull, and knocked him from his )Tj
T*(mount. Seeing their commander dead, the remaining British soldiers waved white )Tj
T*(flags of surrender.[21] )Tj
T*( King's Mountain was the high point of Shelby's military service, and from that )Tj
T*(point forward his men dubbed him "Old King's Mountain".[17] The North Carolina )Tj
T*(legislature passed a vote of thanks to Shelby and Sevier for their service and )Tj
T*(ordered that each be presented a pair of pistols and a ceremonial sword.[22] )Tj
T*(\(Shelby did not receive these items until he requested them from the )Tj
T*(legislature in 1813.\)[23] )Tj
T*( As the colonists and their prisoners began the march from King's Mountain, )Tj
T*(they learned that nine colonial prisoners had been hanged by the British at )Tj
T*(Fort Ninety-Six. This was not the first such incident in the region, and the )Tj
T*(enraged colonists vowed that they would now put a stop to the hangings in the )Tj
T*(Carolinas. Summoning a jury from their number¬†‚Äì which was legal because two )Tj
T*(North Carolina magistrates were present¬†‚Äì the colonists selected random )Tj
T*(prisoners and charged them with crimes ranging from theft to arson to murder. )Tj
T*(By evening, the jury had convicted thirty-six prisoners and sentenced them to )Tj
T*(hang. After the first nine hangings, however, Shelby ordered them stopped. He )Tj
T*(never gave a reason for this action, but his order was obeyed nonetheless, and )Tj
T*(the remaining "convicts" rejoined their fellow prisoners.[24] )Tj
T*( The King's Mountain victors and their prisoners returned to McDowell's estate )Tj
T*(early on the morning of October 10, 1780. From there, the various commanders )Tj
T*(and their men went their separate ways. Shelby and his men joined General )Tj
T*(Daniel Morgan at New Providence, South Carolina. While there, Shelby advised )Tj
T*(Morgan to take Fort Ninety-Six and Augusta because he believed the British )Tj
T*(forces there were supplying the Cherokee with weapons for their raids against )Tj
T*(colonial settlers. Morgan agreed to the plan, as did General Horatio Gates, the )Tj

T*(Banastre Tarleton and gained a decisive victory over him at the Battle of )Tj
T*(Cowpens. Shelby later lamented the fact that General Nathanael Greene, who )Tj
T*(relieved Gates only days after Shelby departed for home, claimed the lion's )Tj
T*(share of the credit for Cowpens when it was Shelby's plan that had put Morgan )Tj
T*(in the position to begin with.[25] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later wartime service and settlement in Kentucky )Tj
T*( Upon his return home, Shelby and his father were named commissioners to )Tj
T*(negotiate a treaty between colonial settlers and the Chickamauga.[26] This )Tj
T*(service delayed his return to Greene, but in October 1781 he and Sevier led 600 )Tj
T*(riflemen to join Greene in South Carolina.[27] Greene had thought to use )Tj
T*(Shelby's and Sevier's men to prevent Cornwallis from returning to Charleston. )Tj
T*(However, Cornwallis was defeated at the Siege of Yorktown shortly after Shelby )Tj
T*(and Sevier arrived, and Greene sent them on to join General Francis Marion on )Tj
T*(the Pee Dee River.[27] On Marion's orders, Shelby and Colonel Hezekiah Maham )Tj
T*(captured a British fort at Fair Lawn near Moncks Corner on November 27, )Tj
T*(1781.[27] )Tj
T*( While still in the field, Shelby was elected to the North Carolina General )Tj
T*(Assembly.[27] He requested and was granted a leave of absence from the Army to )Tj
T*(attend the legislative session of December 1781.[27] He was re-elected in 1782 )Tj
T*(and attended the April session of the legislature that year.[27] In early 1783 )Tj
T*(he was chosen as a commissioner to survey preemption claims of soldiers along )Tj
T*(the Cumberland River.[28] )Tj
T*( Shelby returned to Kentucky in April 1783, settling at Boonesborough.[27] He )Tj
T*(married Susannah Hart on April 19, 1783; the couple had eleven children.[2] )Tj
T*(Their eldest daughter, Sarah, married Dr. Ephraim McDowell, and the youngest )Tj
T*(daughter, Letitia, married future Kentucky secretary of state Charles Stewart )Tj
T*(Todd.[2][29] On November 1, 1783, the family moved to Lincoln County, near Knob )Tj
T*(Lick, and occupied land awarded to Shelby for his military service.[17] Shelby )Tj
T*(was named one of the first trustees of Transylvania Seminary \(later )Tj
T*(Transylvania University\) in 1783, and on December 1, 1787, founded the Kentucky )Tj
T*(Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge.[27] )Tj
T*( Shelby began working to secure Kentucky's separation from Virginia as early as )Tj
T*(1784.[30] That year, he attended a convention to consider leading an expedition )Tj
T*(against the Indians and separating Kentucky from Virginia.[2] He was a delegate )Tj
T*(to subsequent conventions in 1787, 1788, and 1789 that worked toward a )Tj
T*(constitution for Kentucky.[2] During these conventions he helped thwart James )Tj
T*(Wilkinson's scheme to align Kentucky with the Spanish.[22] In 1791 Shelby, )Tj
T*(Charles Scott and Benjamin Logan were among those chosen by the Virginia )Tj
T*(legislature to serve on the Board of War for the district of Kentucky.[9] )Tj
T*(Shelby was also made High Sheriff on Lincoln County.[9] In 1792 he was a )Tj
T*(delegate to the final convention that framed the first Kentucky )Tj
T*(Constitution.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] First term as governor )Tj
T*( Under the new constitution, the voters chose electors who then elected the )Tj
T*(governor and members of the Kentucky Senate.[17] Though there is no indication )Tj
T*(that Shelby actively sought the office of governor, he was elected unanimously )Tj
T*(to that post by the electors on May 17, 1791.[17] He took office on June 4, )Tj
T*(1792, the day the state was admitted to the Union.[30] Though not actively )Tj
T*(partisan, he identified with the Democratic-Republicans.[31] Much of his term )Tj
T*(was devoted to establishing basic laws, military divisions and a tax )Tj
T*(structure.[30] )Tj
T*( One of Shelby's chief concerns was securing federal aid to defend the )Tj
T*(frontier.[1] Although Kentuckians were engaged in an undeclared war with )Tj
T*(American Indians north of the Ohio River, Shelby had been ordered by Secretary )Tj
T*(of War Henry Knox not to conduct offensive military actions against the )Tj
T*(Indians.[32] Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted )Tj
T*(the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was too short to be )Tj
T*(effective.[32] With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only )Tj
T*(able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack.[31] Meanwhile, )Tj

T*(Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by )Tj
T*(the British.[33] )Tj
T*( Shelby appealed to President Washington for help; Washington responded by )Tj
T*(appointing General "Mad" Anthony Wayne to the area with orders to push the )Tj
T*(Indians out of the Northwest Territory. Wayne arrived at Fort Washington )Tj
T*(\(present-day Cincinnati, Ohio\) in May 1793, but was prevented from taking any )Tj
T*(immediate action because federal commissioners were still attempting to )Tj
T*(negotiate a treaty with the Indians. He called for 1,000 volunteer troops from )Tj
T*(Kentucky, but few heeded the call and Shelby resorted to conscription. By the )Tj
T*(time the soldiers arrived, winter had set in. He ordered the men to go home and )Tj
T*(return in the spring.[34] )Tj
T*( After a winter filled with Indian attacks, including one which claimed the )Tj
T*(life of Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won )Tj
T*(some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794.[35] In spring the response )Tj
T*(to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at )Tj
T*(Fort Greenville and were hastily trained.[36] By August, 1794, Wayne was on the )Tj
T*(offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, )Tj
T*(1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers.[36] This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of )Tj
T*(Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby did not agree with some )Tj
T*(of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by )Tj
T*(its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.[37] )Tj
T*( Another major concern of the Shelby administration was free navigation on the )Tj
T*(Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For )Tj
T*(political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the )Tj
T*(Americans. This would have been the natural market for the tobacco, flour and )Tj
T*(hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be )Tj
T*(profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration )Tj
T*(to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the )Tj
T*(federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this )Tj
T*(situation.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Citizen Gen√™t affair )Tj
T*( While Kentuckians despised the British and Spanish, they had a strong affinity )Tj
T*(for the French. They admired the republican government that had arisen from the )Tj
T*(French Revolution, and they had not forgotten France's aid during the )Tj
T*(Revolutionary War. When French Ambassador Edmond-Charles Gen√™t, popularly known )Tj
T*(as Citizen Gen√™t, arrived in the United States in April 1793, George Rogers )Tj
T*(Clark was already considering an expedition to capture Spanish lands in the )Tj
T*(west. Gen√™t's agent, Andr√© Michaux, was dispatched to Kentucky to assess the )Tj
T*(support of Kentuckians toward Clark's expedition. When he gained an audience )Tj
T*(with Governor Shelby, he did so with letters of introduction from Secretary of )Tj
T*(State Thomas Jefferson and Kentucky Senator John Brown.[39] )Tj
T*( Jefferson had written a separate letter to Shelby warning him against aiding )Tj
T*(the French schemes and informing him that negotiations were under way with the )Tj
T*(Spanish regarding trade on the Mississippi. When the letter was sent on August )Tj
T*(29, 1793, it was Jefferson's intent that it reach Shelby before Michaux did, )Tj
T*(but Shelby did not receive it until October 1793. On September 13, 1793, )Tj
T*(Michaux met with Shelby, but there is no evidence that Shelby agreed to help )Tj
T*(him. In his response to Jefferson's delayed letter, Shelby assured Jefferson )Tj
T*(that Kentuckians "possess too just a sense of the obligation they owe the )Tj
T*(General Government, to embark in any enterprise that would be so injurious to )Tj
T*(the United States".[40] )Tj
T*( In November 1793, Shelby received a letter from another of Gen√™t's agents, )Tj
T*(Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies )Tj
T*(for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had )Tj
T*(been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days )Tj
T*(later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding )Tj
T*(the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Gen√™t's scheme, )Tj
T*(both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson )Tj
T*(provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky )Tj
T*(and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky )Tj

T*(would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, )Tj
T*(should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that )Tj
T*(his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the )Tj
T*(American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with )Tj
T*(Gen√™t.[41] )Tj
T*( In his response to Jefferson, Shelby questioned whether he had the legal )Tj
T*(authority to intervene with force against his constituency and expressed his )Tj
T*(personal aversion to doing so. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I shall upon all occasions be averse to the exercise of any power which I do )Tj
T*(not consider myself as being clearly and explicitly invested with, much less )Tj
T*(would I assume power to exercise it against men whom I consider as friends and )Tj
T*(brethren, in favor of a man whom I view as an enemy and a tyrant [the king of )Tj
T*(Spain]. I shall also feel but little inclination to take an active part in )Tj
T*(punishing or restraining any of my fellow-citizens for a supposed intention )Tj
T*(only to gratify or remove the fears of the ministers of a foreign prince, who )Tj
T*(openly withholds from us an invaluable right [navigation of the Mississippi] )Tj
T*(and who secretly instigates against us a most savage and cruel enemy.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Shelby tempered this lukewarm commitment by assuring Jefferson that "I shall, )Tj
T*(at all times, hold it my duty to perform whatever may be constitutionally )Tj
T*(required of me, as Governor of Kentucky, by the President of the United )Tj
T*(States."[42] )Tj
T*( In March 1794, perhaps in response to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a )Tj
T*(measure granting the government additional powers in the event of an invasion )Tj
T*(or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received )Tj
T*(Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, )Tj
T*(and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Gen√™t. Two months )Tj
T*(later Gen√™t's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential )Tj
T*(crisis was averted.[43] In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement )Tj
T*(with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.[44] )Tj
T*( Having successfully dealt with the major challenges and issues involved in )Tj
T*(forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially )Tj
T*(sound.[44] Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving )Tj
T*(consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County )Tj
T*(estate, at the conclusion of his term in 1796.[9] For the next 15 years he )Tj
T*(tended to affairs on his farm.[2] He was selected as a presidential elector in )Tj
T*(six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life )Tj
T*(during this period.[45] )Tj
T*( [edit] Second term as governor )Tj
T*( Gabriel Slaughter was the favorite choice for governor of Kentucky in 1812. )Tj
T*(Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions )Tj
T*(between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into )Tj
T*(open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as )Tj
T*(a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited )Tj
T*(him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured him that he had no desire to )Tj
T*(do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. )Tj
T*(Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.[46] )Tj
T*( The situation with the European powers grew worse, and on June 18, 1812 the )Tj
T*(United States declared war on Great Britain, beginning the War of 1812. Cries )Tj
T*(grew louder for Shelby to return as Kentucky's chief executive. On July 18, )Tj
T*(1812, less than a month before the election, Shelby acquiesced and announced )Tj
T*(his candidacy.[47] )Tj
T*( During the campaign Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, )Tj
T*(criticized his response to Jefferson's second letter regarding the Gen√™t affair )Tj
T*(and questioned his loyalty to the United States.[48] Shelby contended that his )Tj
T*(noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's )Tj
T*(attention to the situation in the west.[48] He cited the agreement between )Tj

T*( Slaughter's supporters mocked Shelby's advanced age \(he was almost 62\), )Tj
T*(calling him "Old Daddy Shelby". One Kentucky paper even printed an anonymous )Tj
T*(charge that Shelby had run from the Battle of King's Mountain. Though few even )Tj
T*(among Shelby's enemies believed the story, his supporters and Shelby himself )Tj
T*(responded through missives in the state's newspapers. One supporter typified )Tj
T*(these responses, writing "It is reported that Colonel Shelby 'run [sic] at )Tj
T*(King's Mountain.' True he did. He first run [sic] up to the enemy... then after )Tj
T*(an action of about forty-seven minutes, he run [sic] again with 900 )Tj
T*(prisoners."[49] )Tj
T*( As the canvass stretched into August, Shelby grew more confident of victory )Tj
T*(and began preparations to return to the state house. He predicted a victory of )Tj
T*(10,000 votes; the final margin was more than 17,000.[50] When he took the oath )Tj
T*(of office, Shelby became the first Kentucky governor to serve non-consecutive )Tj
T*(terms. \(James Garrard had been permitted to serve consecutive terms in 1796 and )Tj
T*(1800 by special legislative exemption.\) )Tj
T*( Preparations for the war dominated Shelby's second term. Two days before his )Tj
T*(inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to )Tj
T*(appoint William Henry Harrison commander of the Kentucky militia. This was done )Tj
T*(in violation of a constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native )Tj
T*(Kentuckian. Already commander of the militias of Indiana and Illinois, Harrison )Tj
T*(picked up Kentucky volunteers at Newport before hurrying to the defense of Fort )Tj
T*(Wayne.[51] )Tj
T*( Shelby pressured President James Madison to give Harrison command of all )Tj
T*(military forces in the Northwest.[44] Madison acceded, rescinding his earlier )Tj
T*(appointment of James Winchester.[51] On the state level, Shelby revised militia )Tj
T*(laws to make every male between the ages of 18 and 45 eligible for military )Tj
T*(service; ministers were excluded from the provision.[44] Seven thousand )Tj
T*(volunteers enlisted, and many more had to be turned away.[52] Shelby encouraged )Tj
T*(the state's women to sew and knit items for Kentucky's troops.[44] )Tj
T*( Shelby's confidence in the federal government's war planning was shaken by the )Tj
T*(disastrous Battle of Frenchtown in which a number of Kentucky soldiers )Tj
T*(died.[44] He vowed to personally act to aid the war effort should the )Tj
T*(opportunity arise, and was authorized by the legislature to do so.[44] In March )Tj
T*(1813, Harrison requested another 1,200 Kentuckians to join him at Fort )Tj
T*(Meigs.[53] Shelby dispatched the requested number, among whom was his oldest )Tj
T*(son James, under General Green Clay.[54][54] The reinforcements arrived to find )Tj
T*(Fort Meigs under siege by a combined force of British and Indians.[54] Clay's )Tj
T*(force was able to stop the siege, but a large number of them were captured and )Tj
T*(massacred by Indians.[55] Initial reports put James Shelby among the dead, but )Tj
T*(he was later discovered to have been captured and released in a prisoner )Tj
T*(exchange.[55] )Tj
T*( On July 30, 1813, General Harrison again wrote Shelby requesting volunteers, )Tj
T*(and this time he asked that Shelby lead them personally.[44] Shelby raised a )Tj
T*(force of 3,500 volunteers, double the number Harrison requested.[1] Future )Tj
T*(governor John J. Crittenden served as Shelby's aide-de-camp.[56] Now a Major )Tj
T*(General, Shelby led the volunteers to join Harrison in a campaign that )Tj
T*(culminated in the American victory at the Battle of the Thames.[1] )Tj
T*( In Harrison's report of the battle to Secretary of War John Armstrong, Jr., he )Tj
T*(said of Shelby, "I am at a loss to how to mention [the service] of Governor )Tj
T*(Shelby, being convinced that no eulogism of mine can reach his merit."[57] In )Tj
T*(1817, Shelby received the thanks of Congress and was awarded the Congressional )Tj
T*(Gold Medal for his service in the war.[45] Friends of Shelby suggested he run )Tj
T*(for Vice President, but Shelby quickly and emphatically declined.[58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later life and death )Tj
T*( Upon Shelby's leaving office in 1816, President Monroe offered him the post of )Tj
T*(Secretary of War, but he declined because of his age.[2] Already a founding )Tj
T*(member of the Kentucky Bible Society, Shelby consented to serve as )Tj
T*(vice-president of the New American Bible Society in 1816.[59] He was a faithful )Tj

T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Shelby's patriotism is believed to have inspired the Kentucky state motto: )Tj
T*("United we stand, divided we fall". He was fond of The Liberty Song, a 1768 )Tj
T*(composition by John Dickinson, which contains the line "They join in hand, )Tj
T*(brave Americans all, By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall."[61] Though he )Tj
T*(is sometimes credited with designing the state seal, his public papers show )Tj
T*(that the design was suggested by James Wilkinson.[62] )Tj
T*( Centre College began awarding the Isaac Shelby Medallion in 1972, and since )Tj
T*(then, it has become the College's most prestigious honor. Those awarded the )Tj
T*(Medallion exemplify the ideals of service to Centre and dedication to the )Tj

T*( On April 3, 1848, the Board of Trade opened for business at 101 South Water )Tj
T*(Street. When 122 members were added in 1856, it was moved to the corner of )Tj
T*(South Water and LaSalle Streets. After another temporary relocation west on )Tj
T*(South Water Street in 1860, the first permanent home was established within the )Tj
T*(Chamber of Commerce Building on the corner of LaSalle and Washington Streets in )Tj
T*(1865. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed this building. The exchange )Tj
T*(temporarily reopened two weeks after the fire in a 90 feet \(27¬†m\) wooden )Tj

T*( [edit] Permanent home )Tj
T*( In 1882, construction began of the CBOT's new home, which opened at the )Tj
T*(current location on May 1, 1885. It was designed by William W. Boyington, known )Tj
T*(previously for his work on the Chicago Water Tower. Built from structural steel )Tj
T*(and Maine granite, with a rear of enameled brick, it was 10¬†stories tall and )Tj
T*(featured a tower 320¬†ft \(98¬†m\) tall containing a large clock and 4,500 pounds )Tj
T*(\(2,000¬†kg; 320¬†st\) bell, topped by a 9 feet \(2.7¬†m\) copper weather vane in the )Tj

T*(terms\). With four elevators and a great hall 80¬†ft \(24¬†m\) high decorated by a )Tj
T*(stained-glass skylight and ornate stone balusters,[8] it was the first )Tj
T*(commercial building in Chicago to have electric lighting.[9] It was also the )Tj

T*(was the tallest building in Chicago. )Tj
T*( The building attracted tourists, visitors, and protesters. Viewing galleries )Tj
T*(were opened to the public for the first time in honor of the 1893 World's )Tj

T*( [edit] Trading floor )Tj
T*( According to the June 16, 1930 issue of Time magazine, visitors carrying )Tj
T*(ripened wheat heads stared in curiosity at the six-story tall trading room )Tj
T*(directly above the lobby and behind the large windows below the clock facing )Tj
T*(LaSalle Street. At the center of the room, Time reported on the items being )Tj
T*(traded in "pits" organized based on commodities type with pits names such as )Tj
T*(the corn pit, soybean pit or wheat pit. The individual pits are raised )Tj
T*(octagonal structures where open outcry trading occurs. Steps up the outside of )Tj
T*(each octagon provide an amphitheater atmosphere, and enable a large number of )Tj
T*(traders to see each other and communicate during trading hours. With early )Tj
T*(versions dating back to 1870, this type of trading pit was patented in 1878.[7] )Tj
T*( The trading area is surrounded by desks allowing workers to support )Tj
T*(transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the )Tj
T*(pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began )Tj
T*(to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later )Tj
T*(replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards )Tj
T*(lined the walls of the trading hall and the advent of electronic trading )Tj
T*(resulted in computers being placed on desktops. )Tj
T*( Subsequent additions to the Board of Trade Building moved the agricultural and )Tj
T*(financial trading floors out of the original trading room and into new spaces )Tj
T*(in the additions to the building's rear in the 1980s. In 2004 the historic 1930 )Tj
T*(trading floor, already substantially altered \(and unused for more than two )Tj
T*(years\), was demolished and its pits filled with concrete. It was renovated in a )Tj
T*(modern style and now is leased to a privately owned options trading firm.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Expansion )Tj
T*( In 1980, the owners added a 275¬†ft \(84¬†m\) 23-story expansion to the south side )Tj
T*(of the building.[30] It was topped by an octagonal ornament shaped similarly to )Tj
T*(the terraced trading pits and was designed in a postmodern style by Helmut )Tj
T*(Jahn. Colored black and silver, with a sunlit atrium on the 12th floor facing )Tj
T*(the south wall of the older structure, the annex provided a four-story granite )Tj
T*(lined agricultural trading floor, then the world's largest at 32,000 square )Tj
T*(feet \(2,970¬†m2\).[7] Even as the Sydney Futures Exchange and other markets were )Tj
T*(ceasing outcry trading, Mayor Richard M. Daley led the groundbreaking on )Tj
T*(January 17, 1995, for additional expansion into a five-story building to the )Tj
T*(east designed by architects Fujikawa Johnson and structural engineers TT-CBM. )Tj
T*(When opened in 1997, the $175¬†million structure would add 60,000 square feet )Tj
T*(\(5,570¬†m2\) of trading space and for a period again would house the world's )Tj
T*(largest trading floor.[7][16][31] It was nicknamed the "Arboretum" by some in )Tj
T*(reference to expansion supporter CBOT Chairman Patrick H. Arbor.[16] The )Tj
T*(expansion included price boards 600 feet \(183¬†m\) long and supported 12,000 )Tj
T*(computers, 6,000 voice devices, and 2,000 video devices requiring 27,000 miles )Tj
T*(\(43,500¬†km\) of cable.[32] Collectively, the trading floors now encompass )Tj
T*(approximately 115,150 square feet \(10,700¬†m2\).[33] The logo of the CBOT )Tj
T*(represents a trading pit, and appears prominently on stonework facing Clark )Tj
T*(Street and on street-level barriers at the service entrance on Van Buren )Tj
T*(Street. The addition has a twelve-story atrium and melds historical and )Tj
T*(contemporary design with art deco references such as setbacks, central tower, )Tj
T*(symmetrical projecting wings, pyramidal roof and abstract cascade and scallop )Tj
T*(lobby design.[34] Between the original and new buildings, where there was )Tj

T*( George Percy Aldridge Grainger \(8 July 1882¬†‚Äì 20 February 1961\), known as )Tj
T*(Percy Grainger, was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist. In the )Tj
T*(course of a long and innovative career he played a prominent role in the )Tj
T*(revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th )Tj
T*(century. He also made many adaptations of other composers' works. Although much )Tj
T*(of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most )Tj
T*(generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune "Country )Tj
T*(Gardens". )Tj
T*( Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in )Tj
T*(Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established )Tj
T*(himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer )Tj
T*(and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of )Tj
T*(the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with )Tj
T*(Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and )Tj
T*(culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters. )Tj
T*( In 1914 Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of )Tj
T*(his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australasia. He served )Tj
T*(briefly as a bandsman in the US Army during 1917‚Äì18, and took US citizenship in )Tj

T*(supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in )Tj
T*(Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works and as a future )Tj
T*(research archive. As he grew older he continued to give concerts and to revise )Tj
T*(and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the )Tj
T*(Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity, and he considered )Tj
T*(his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before )Tj
T*(his death. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( [edit] Family background )Tj
T*( Percy Grainger's father, John Grainger \(1854‚Äì1917\),[n 1] was a British-born )Tj
T*(architect who emigrated to Australia in 1877. He won professional recognition )Tj
T*(for his design of the Princes Bridge across the Yarra River in Melbourne.[2] In )Tj
T*(October 1880 he married Rose Annie Aldridge, daughter of Adelaide hotelier )Tj
T*(George Aldridge; the couple settled in New St, Brighton, a suburb of Melbourne, )Tj
T*(where their only son, christened George Percy Grainger, was born on 8 July )Tj
T*(1882.[3] The Grainger house at 305 New St, Brighton has recently been )Tj
T*(redeveloped, with the original structure intact. )Tj
T*( John Grainger was an accomplished artist, with broad cultural interests and a )Tj
T*(wide circle of friends.[4] These included David Mitchell, whose daughter Helen )Tj
T*(later gained worldwide fame as an operatic soprano under the name Nellie Melba. )Tj
T*(John's claims to have "discovered" her are unfounded, although he may have )Tj
T*(offered her encouragement.[5] John was a heavy drinker and a womaniser who, )Tj
T*(Rose learned after the marriage, had fathered a child in England before coming )Tj
T*(to Australia. His promiscuous lifestyle placed heavy strains upon the )Tj
T*(relationship, particularly when Rose discovered shortly after Percy's birth )Tj
T*(that she had contracted a form of syphilis from her husband.[3][4] Despite )Tj
T*(this, the Graingers stayed together until 1890, when John went to England for )Tj
T*(medical treatment. After his return to Australia they lived apart; the burden )Tj
T*(of raising Percy fell to Rose,[6] while John pursued his career as chief )Tj
T*(architect to the Western Australian Department of Public Works. He also )Tj
T*(designed Nellie Melba's home, Coombe Cottage, at Coldstream.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Childhood )Tj
T*( Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he )Tj
T*(was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.[4] )Tj
T*(Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and )Tj
T*(literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From )Tj
T*(his earliest lessons Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic )Tj
T*(culture; writing late in life he maintained that the Icelandic "Saga of Grettir )Tj
T*(the Strong" was "the strongest single artistic influence on my life".[7][8][9] )Tj
T*(As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early )Tj
T*(gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie )Tj
T*(in art rather than music.[10] At the age of 10 he began studying piano under )Tj
T*(Louis Pabst, a German emigr√© then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano )Tj
T*(teacher. Grainger's first known composition, "A Birthday Gift to Mother", is )Tj
T*(dated 1893.[2] Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at )Tj
T*(Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by )Tj
T*(Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the )Tj
T*(Melbourne press.[11] )Tj
T*( After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano )Tj
T*(tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts )Tj
T*(in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this )Tj
T*(enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance )Tj
T*(delighted the Melbourne critics who dubbed him "the flaxen-haired phenomenon )Tj
T*(who plays like a master".[12] This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that )Tj
T*(her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt am )Tj
T*(Main, Germany ‚Äì she had been recommended to this institution by William Laver, )Tj
T*(head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial )Tj
T*(assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and )Tj
T*(a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for )Tj
T*(Europe on 29 May 1895.[13] Although he never returned permanently to Australia, )Tj

T*(Grainger maintained considerable patriotic feelings for his native land,[14] )Tj
T*(and was proud of his Australian heritage.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Frankfurt )Tj
T*( In Frankfurt, Rose established herself as a teacher of English; her earnings )Tj
T*(were supplemented by contributions from John Grainger, who had settled in )Tj
T*(Perth. The Hoch Conservatory's reputation for piano teaching had been enhanced )Tj
T*(by the tenure, until 1892, of Clara Schumann as head of piano studies. )Tj
T*(Grainger's piano tutor was James Kwast, who developed his young pupil's skills )Tj
T*(to the extent that, within a year, Grainger was being lauded as a prodigy.[15] )Tj
T*(Grainger had difficult relations with his original composition teacher, Iwan )Tj
T*(Knorr;[4] he withdrew from Knorr's classes to study composition privately with )Tj
T*(an amateur composer and folk-music enthusiast, Karl Klimsch, whom he would )Tj
T*(later honour as "my only composition teacher".[2] )Tj
T*( Together with a group of slightly older British students ‚Äì Roger Quilter, )Tj
T*(Balfour Gardiner, Cyril Scott and Norman O'Neill, all of whom became his )Tj
T*(friends ‚Äì Grainger helped form the "Frankfurt Group", whose long-term objective )Tj
T*(was to rescue British and Scandinavian music from what they considered the )Tj
T*(negative influences of central European music.[4] Encouraged by Klimsch, )Tj
T*(Grainger turned away from composing classical pastiches reminiscent of Handel, )Tj
T*(Haydn and Mozart,[16] and developed a personal compositional style the )Tj
T*(originality and maturity of which quickly impressed and astonished his )Tj
T*(friends.[14] At this time Grainger discovered the poetry of Rudyard Kipling and )Tj
T*(began setting it to music; according to Scott, "No poet and composer have been )Tj
T*(so suitably wedded since Heine &amp; Schumann".[14] )Tj
T*( After accompanying her son on an extended European tour in the summer of 1900 )Tj
T*(Rose, whose health had been poor for some time, suffered a nervous collapse and )Tj
T*(could no longer work.[17] To replace lost income Grainger began giving piano )Tj
T*(lessons and public performances; his first solo recital was in Frankfurt on 6 )Tj
T*(December 1900.[2] Meanwhile he continued his studies with Kwast, and increased )Tj
T*(his repertoire until he was confident he could maintain himself and his mother )Tj
T*(as a concert pianist. Having chosen London as his future base, in May 1901 )Tj
T*(Grainger abandoned his studies and, with Rose, left Frankfurt for England.[17] )Tj
T*( Before leaving Frankfurt, Grainger had fallen in love with Kwast's daughter )Tj
T*(Mimi;[17] in an autobiographical essay dated 1947 he admits to being "already )Tj
T*(sex-crazy" at this time.[18] \(Mimi Kwast, who was the grand-daughter of )Tj
T*(Ferdinand Hiller, married another of her father's pupils, Hans Pfitzner.\) John )Tj
T*(Bird, Grainger's biographer, also records that during his Frankfurt years )Tj
T*(Grainger began to develop sexual appetites that were "distinctly abnormal"; by )Tj
T*(the age of 16 he had started to experiment in flagellation and other )Tj
T*(sado-masochistic practices, which he continued to pursue through most of his )Tj
T*(adult life. Bird surmises that Grainger's fascination with themes of punishment )Tj
T*(and pain derived from the harsh discipline to which Rose had subjected him as a )Tj
T*(child.[18] )Tj

T*(the local Australian community\) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a )Tj
T*(pianist by wealthy patrons, and was soon performing in concerts in private )Tj
T*(homes. The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger's )Tj
T*(playing "revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight".[19] )Tj
T*(In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, )Tj
T*(who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals.[20] Lowrey, 20 years )Tj
T*(Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours ‚Äì he termed )Tj
T*(the relationship a "love-serve job".[8] She was the first woman with whom he )Tj

T*(Orchestra. In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with )Tj
T*(Adelina Patti, the Italian-born opera singer. Patti was greatly taken by the )Tj
T*(young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him.[22] The following year )Tj
T*(he met the German-Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni. Initially the )Tj
T*(two men were on cordial terms \(Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of )Tj
T*(charge\) and as a result, Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as )Tj
T*(Busoni's pupil.[2] However, the visit was not a success; as Bird notes, Busoni )Tj
T*(had expected "a willing slave and adoring disciple", a role Grainger was not )Tj
T*(willing to fulfil.[23] Grainger returned to London in July 1903; almost )Tj
T*(immediately he departed with Rose on a 10-month tour of Australia, New Zealand )Tj
T*(and South Africa, as a member of a party organised by the Australian contralto )Tj
T*(Ada Crossley.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Emergent composer )Tj
T*( Before going to London Grainger had composed numerous Kipling settings, and )Tj
T*(his first mature orchestral pieces.[25] In London, when he found time he )Tj
T*(continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates )Tj
T*(that he was working on his Marching Song of Democracy \(a Walt Whitman setting\), )Tj
T*(and had made good progress with the experimental works Train Music and Charging )Tj
T*(Irishrey.[26] In his early London years he also composed Hill Song Number 1 )Tj
T*(\(1902\), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.[25][27] )Tj
T*( In 1905, inspired by a lecture given by the pioneer folksong historian Lucy )Tj
T*(Broadwood, Grainger began to collect original folksongs. Starting at Brigg in )Tj
T*(Lincolnshire, over the next five years he gathered and transcribed more than )Tj
T*(300 songs from all over the country, including much material that had never )Tj
T*(been written down before. From 1906 Grainger used a phonograph, one of the )Tj
T*(first collectors to do so, and by this means he assembled more than 200 Edison )Tj
T*(cylinder recordings of native folk singers.[28][29] These activities coincided )Tj
T*(with what Bird calls "the halcyon days of the 'First English Folksong )Tj
T*(Revival'".[30] )Tj
T*( As his stature in the music world increased, Grainger became acquainted with )Tj
T*(many of its leading figures, including Vaughan Williams, Elgar, Richard Strauss )Tj
T*(and Debussy.[28] In 1907 he met Frederick Delius, with whom he achieved an )Tj
T*(immediate rapport ‚Äì the two musicians had similar ideas about composition and )Tj
T*(harmony, and shared a dislike for the classical German masters.[31] Both were )Tj
T*(inspired by folk music;[32] Grainger gave Delius his setting of the folksong )Tj
T*(Brigg Fair, which the older composer developed into his famous orchestral )Tj
T*(rhapsody, dedicated to Grainger.[31] The two remained close friends until )Tj
T*(Delius's death in 1934.[33] )Tj
T*( Grainger first met Grieg at the home of the London financier Sir Edgar Speyer, )Tj
T*(in May 1906.[34] As a student Grainger had learned to appreciate the )Tj
T*(Norwegian's harmonic originality, and by 1906 had several Grieg pieces in his )Tj
T*(concert repertoire, including the piano concerto.[35] Grieg was greatly )Tj
T*(impressed with Grainger's playing, and wrote that the Australian was "a genius )Tj
T*(that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love."[36] Through 1906‚Äì7 the two )Tj
T*(maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence, which culminated in )Tj
T*(Grainger's ten-day visit in July 1907 to the composer's Norwegian home, )Tj
T*("Troldhaugen" near Bergen. Here the two spent much time revising and rehearsing )Tj
T*(the piano concerto in preparation for that year's Leeds Festival. Their plans )Tj
T*(for a long-term working relationship were thwarted by Grieg's sudden death in )Tj
T*(September 1907; this relatively brief acquaintance had a considerable impact on )Tj
T*(Grainger, and he championed Grieg's music for the rest of his life.[35] )Tj
T*( After fulfilling a hectic schedule of concert engagements in Britain and )Tj
T*(continental Europe, in August 1908 Grainger accompanied Ada Crossley on a )Tj
T*(second Australasian tour, during which he added several cylinders of Maori and )Tj
T*(Polynesian music to his collection of recordings.[28] He had resolved to )Tj
T*(establish himself as a top-ranking pianist before promoting himself as a )Tj
T*(composer,[9] though he continued to compose both original works and folksong )Tj
T*(settings. Some of his most successful and most characteristic pieces, such as )Tj
T*("Mock Morris", "Handel in the Strand", "Shepherd's Hey" and "Molly on the )Tj
T*(Shore" date from this period. In 1908 he obtained the tune of "Country Gardens" )Tj

T*(from the folk music specialist Cecil Sharp, though he did not fashion it into a )Tj
T*(performable piece for another ten years.[37][38] In 1911 Grainger finally felt )Tj
T*(confident enough of his standing as a pianist to begin large-scale publishing )Tj
T*(of his compositions, at the same time adopting the professional name of "Percy )Tj
T*(Aldridge Grainger".[8][39] )Tj
T*( In a series of concerts arranged by Balfour Gardiner at London's Queen's Hall )Tj
T*(in March 1912, five of Grainger's works were performed to great public acclaim; )Tj
T*(the band of thirty guitars and mandolins for the performance of "Fathers and )Tj
T*(Daughters" created a particular impression.[40] On 21 May 1912 Grainger )Tj
T*(presented the first concert devoted entirely to his own compositions, at the )Tj
T*(Aeolian Hall, London;[9] the concert was, he reported, "a sensational )Tj
T*(success".[41] A similarly enthusiastic reception was given to Grainger's music )Tj
T*(at a second series of Gardiner concerts the following year.[42] )Tj
T*( In 1905 Grainger began a close friendship with Karen Holten, a Danish music )Tj
T*(student who had been recommended to him as a piano pupil. She became an )Tj
T*(important confidante; the relationship persisted for eight years, largely )Tj
T*(through correspondence.[43][n 2] After her marriage in 1916 she and Grainger )Tj
T*(continued to correspond and occasionally meet until her death in 1953. Grainger )Tj
T*(was briefly engaged in 1913 to another pupil, Margot Harrison, but the )Tj
T*(relationship foundered through a mixture of Rose's over-possessiveness and )Tj
T*(Grainger's indecision.[45][46] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career Maturity )Tj
T*( [edit] Departure for America )Tj
T*( In April 1914 Grainger gave his first performance of Delius's piano concerto, )Tj
T*(at a music festival in Torquay. Thomas Beecham, who was one of the festival's )Tj
T*(guest conductors, reported to Delius that "Percy was good in the forte )Tj
T*(passages, but made far too much noise in the quieter bits".[47] Grainger was )Tj
T*(receiving increasing recognition as a composer; leading musicians and )Tj
T*(orchestras were adding his works to their repertoires.[45] His decision to )Tj
T*(leave England for America in early September 1914, after the outbreak of the )Tj
T*(First World War, damaged his reputation among his patriotically minded British )Tj
T*(friends.[2] Grainger wrote that the reason for this abrupt departure was "to )Tj
T*(give mother a change".[48] However, according to Bird, Grainger often explained )Tj
T*(that his reason for leaving London was that "he wanted to emerge as Australia's )Tj
T*(first composer of worth, and to have laid himself open to the possibility of )Tj
T*(being killed would have rendered his goal unattainable".[49]The Daily Telegraph )Tj
T*(music critic Robin Legge accused him of cowardice, and told him not to expect a )Tj
T*(welcome in England after the war,[8] words that hurt Grainger deeply.[50] )Tj
T*( Grainger's first American tour began on 11 February 1915 with a recital at New )Tj
T*(York's Aeolian Hall. He played works by Bach, Brahms, Handel and Chopin )Tj
T*(alongside two of his own compositions: "Colonial Song" and "Mock Morris". In )Tj
T*(July 1915 Grainger had formally registered his intention to apply for US )Tj
T*(citizenship.[51] Over the next two years his engagements included concerts with )Tj
T*(Nellie Melba in Boston and Pittsburgh and a command performance before )Tj
T*(President Woodrow Wilson. In addition to his concert performances, Grainger )Tj
T*(secured a contract with the Duo-Art Company for making pianola rolls, and )Tj
T*(signed a recording contract with Columbia.[9] )Tj
T*( In April 1917 Grainger received news of John Grainger's death in Perth.[52] On )Tj
T*(9 June 1917, after America's entry into the war, he enlisted as a bandsman in )Tj
T*(the Coast Artillery Corps of the US Army. He had joined as a saxophonist,[n 3] )Tj
T*(though he records learning the oboe: "I long for the time when I can blow my )Tj
T*(oboe well enough to play in the band".[55] In his 18 months' service, Grainger )Tj
T*(made frequent appearances as a pianist at Red Cross and Liberty bond concerts. )Tj
T*(As a regular encore he began to play a piano setting of the tune "Country )Tj
T*(Gardens". The piece became instantly popular; sheet music sales quickly broke )Tj
T*(many publishing records.[56] The work was to become synonymous with Grainger's )Tj

T*(conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and resumed his career as a )Tj
T*(concert pianist.[59] He was soon performing around 120 concerts a year,[60] )Tj
T*(generally to great critical acclaim, and in April 1921 reached a wider audience )Tj
T*(by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger commented that )Tj
T*(the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation )Tj
T*(for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall )Tj
T*(and the Aeolian.[61] In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique )Tj
T*(at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would )Tj
T*(undertake in later years.[62][63] )Tj
T*( Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to rescore many of )Tj
T*(his works \(a habit he continued throughout his life\) and also to compose new )Tj
T*(pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral )Tj
T*(version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this )Tj
T*(period.[64] His close friend Ralph Leopold, whom he met while in the army, )Tj
T*(participated in the premieres of both versions of the Children's March, and )Tj
T*(also recorded a number of four-hand works with him on piano rolls. He also )Tj
T*(began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible )Tj
T*(orchestration which enabled works to be performed by different numbers of )Tj
T*(players and instrument types, from small chamber groups up to full orchestral )Tj
T*(strength.[65] )Tj
T*( In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, )Tj
T*(New York. This was his home for the remainder of his life.[8] From the )Tj
T*(beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from )Tj
T*(delusions and nightmares, and became fearful that her illness would harm her )Tj
T*(son's career.[66] Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there )Tj
T*(had long been rumours that their relationship was incestuous;[57] in April 1922 )Tj
T*(Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough.[67] )Tj
T*(From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this )Tj
T*(confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the )Tj
T*(West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window on the 18th floor of )Tj
T*(the Aeolian Building in New York City.[68] The letter, which began "I am out of )Tj
T*(my mind and cannot think properly", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to )Tj
T*(Lotta of "improper love". She signed the letter: "Your poor insane mother".[69] )Tj
T*( [edit] Inter-war years )Tj
T*( [edit] Traveller )Tj
T*( After Rose's funeral, Grainger sought solace in a return to work. In autumn )Tj
T*(1922 he left for a year-long trip to Europe, where he collected and recorded )Tj
T*(Danish folksongs before a concert tour that took him to Norway, Holland, )Tj
T*(Germany and England. In Norway he stayed with Delius at the latter's summer )Tj
T*(home. Delius was by now almost blind; Grainger helped fulfil his friend's wish )Tj
T*(to see a Norwegian sunset by carrying him \(with some assistance\) to the top of )Tj
T*(a nearby mountain peak.[70] He returned to White Plains in August 1923.[71] )Tj
T*( Although now less committed to a year-round schedule of concerts, Grainger )Tj
T*(remained a very popular performer. His eccentricities, often exaggerated for )Tj
T*(publicity reasons, reportedly included running into auditoriums in gym kit and )Tj
T*(leaping over the grand piano to create a grand entrance.[72] While he continued )Tj
T*(to revise and rescore his compositions, he increasingly worked on arrangements )Tj
T*(of music by other composers,[73] in particular works by Bach, Brahms, Faur√© and )Tj
T*(Delius.[74] Away from music, Grainger's preoccupation with Nordic culture led )Tj
T*(him to develop a form of English which, he maintained, reflected the character )Tj
T*(of the language before the Norman conquest. Words of Norman or Latin origin )Tj
T*(were replaced by supposedly Nordic word-forms, such as "blend-band" )Tj
T*(\(orchestra\), "forthspeaker" \(lecturer\) and "writ-piece" \(article\). He called )Tj
T*(this "blue-eyed" English.[75] His convictions of Nordic superiority eventually )Tj
T*(led Grainger, in letters to friends, to express his views in crudely racial and )Tj
T*(anti-Semitic terms; the music historian David Pear describes Grainger as, "at )Tj
T*(root, a racial bigot of no small order".[76][n 4] )Tj
T*( Grainger made further trips to Europe in 1925 and 1927, collecting more Danish )Tj

T*(also visited Australia and New Zealand, in 1924 and again in 1926. In November )Tj
T*(1926, while returning to America, he met Ella Str√∂m, a Swedish-born artist with )Tj
T*(whom he developed a close friendship. On arrival in America the pair separated, )Tj
T*(but were reunited in England the following autumn after Grainger's final )Tj
T*(folksong expedition to Denmark. In October 1927 the couple agreed to marry.[80] )Tj
T*(Ella had a daughter, Elsie, who had been born out of wedlock in 1909. Grainger )Tj
T*(always acknowledged her as a family member, and developed a warm personal )Tj
T*(relationship with her.[81] )Tj
T*( Although Bird asserts that before her marriage, Ella knew nothing of )Tj
T*(Grainger's sado-masochistic interests,[82] in a letter dated 23 April 1928 )Tj
T*(\(four months before the wedding\) Grainger writes to her: "As far as my taste )Tj
T*(goes, blows [with the whip] are most thrilling on breasts, bottom, inner )Tj
T*(thighs, sexparts". He later adds, "I shall thoroly thoroly [sic] understand if )Tj
T*(you cannot in any way see yr way to follow up this hot wish of mine".[83] The )Tj
T*(couple were married on 9 August 1928 at the Hollywood Bowl, at the end of a )Tj
T*(concert which, in honour of the bride, had included the first performance of )Tj
T*(Grainger's bridal song "To a Nordic Princess".[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Educator )Tj
T*( From the late 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became involved increasingly with )Tj
T*(educational work in schools and colleges,[9] and in late 1931 accepted a year's )Tj
T*(appointment for 1932‚Äì33 as professor of music at New York University \(NYU\). In )Tj
T*(this role he delivered a series of lectures under the heading "A General Study )Tj
T*(of the Manifold Nature of Music", which introduced his students to a wide range )Tj
T*(of ancient and modern works.[9] On 25 October 1932 his lecture was illustrated )Tj
T*(by Duke Ellington and his band, who appeared in person; Grainger admired )Tj
T*(Ellington's music, seeing harmonic similarities with Delius. On the whole, )Tj
T*(however, Grainger did not enjoy his tenure at NYU; he disliked the )Tj
T*(institutional formality, and found the university generally unreceptive to his )Tj
T*(ideas. Despite many offers he never accepted another formal academic )Tj
T*(appointment, and refused all offers of honorary degrees.[84][n 5] His New York )Tj
T*(lectures became the basis for a series of radio talks which he gave for the )Tj
T*(Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1934‚Äì35; these were later summarised and )Tj
T*(published as Music: A Commonsense View of All Types.[2] On 3 and 4 September )Tj
T*(1934 Grainger adjudicated at the Sydney Eisteddfod on Sections 10 \(Vocal )Tj
T*(Ensemble\) and 45 \(String Ensemble\) for which he selected and provided the )Tj
T*(music. In 1937 Grainger began an association with the Interlochen International )Tj
T*(Music Camp, and taught regularly at its summer schools until 1944.[86] )Tj
T*( [edit] Innovator )Tj
T*( The idea of establishing a Grainger Museum in Australia had first occurred to )Tj
T*(Grainger in 1932. He began collecting and recovering from friends letters and )Tj
T*(artifacts, even those demonstrating the most private aspects of his life,[87] )Tj
T*(such as whips, bloodstained shirts and revealing photographs.[88] In September )Tj
T*(1933 he and Ella went to Australia to begin supervising the building work. To )Tj
T*(finance the project, Grainger embarked on a series of concerts and )Tj
T*(broadcasts,[89] in which he subjected his audiences to a vast range of the )Tj
T*(world's music in accordance with his "universalist" view. Controversially, he )Tj
T*(argued for the superior achievements of Nordic composers over traditionally )Tj
T*(recognised masters such as Mozart and Beethoven.[2] )Tj
T*( Among various new ideas, Grainger introduced his so-called "free-music" )Tj
T*(theories. He believed that conformity with the traditional rules of set scales, )Tj
T*(rhythms and harmonic procedures amounted to "absurd goose-stepping", from which )Tj
T*(music should be set free.[90] He demonstrated two experimental compositions of )Tj
T*(free music, performed initially by a string quartet and later by the use of )Tj
T*(electronic theremins.[8] He believed that ideally, free music required )Tj
T*(non-human performance, and spent much of his later life developing machines to )Tj
T*(fulfil this vision.[91] )Tj
T*( While the building of the museum proceeded, the Graingers visited England for )Tj
T*(several months in 1936, during which Grainger made his first BBC broadcast. In )Tj
T*(this, he conducted "Love Verses from The Song of Solomon" in which the tenor )Tj
T*(soloist was the then unknown Peter Pears.[92] After spending 1937 in America, )Tj

T*(Grainger returned to Melbourne in 1938 for the official opening of the Museum; )Tj
T*(among those present at the ceremony was his old piano teacher Adelaide Burkitt. )Tj
T*(The museum did not open to the general public during Grainger's lifetime, but )Tj
T*(was available to scholars for research.[93][94] )Tj
T*( In the late 1930s Grainger spent much time arranging his works in settings for )Tj
T*(wind bands. He wrote A Lincolnshire Posy for the March 1937 convention of the )Tj
T*(American Band Masters' Association in Milwaukee,[95] and in 1939, on his last )Tj
T*(visit to England before the Second World War, he composed "The Duke of )Tj
T*(Marlborough's Fanfare", giving it the subtitle "British War Mood Grows".[93] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later career )Tj
T*( [edit] Second World War )Tj
T*( The outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 curtailed Grainger's overseas )Tj
T*(travelling. In the autumn of 1940, alarmed that the war might precipitate an )Tj
T*(invasion of the United States eastern seaboard, he and Ella moved to )Tj
T*(Springfield, Missouri, in the centre of the continent.[96] From 1940 Grainger )Tj
T*(played regularly in charity concerts, especially after the attack on Pearl )Tj
T*(Harbor brought the United States into the war in December 1941; the historian )Tj
T*(Robert Simon calculates that Grainger made a total of 274 charity appearances )Tj
T*(during the war years, many of them at Army and Air force camps.[94] In 1942 a )Tj
T*(collection of his Kipling settings, the Jungle Book cycle, was performed in )Tj
T*(eight cities by the choir of the Gustavus Adolphus College from St. Peter, )Tj
T*(Minnesota.[97] )Tj
T*( [edit] Postwar decline )Tj
T*( Exhausted from his wartime concerts routine, Grainger spent much of 1946 on )Tj
T*(holiday in Europe. He was experiencing a sense of career failure; in 1947, when )Tj
T*(refusing the Chair of Music at Adelaide University, he wrote: "If I were 40 )Tj
T*(years younger, and not so crushed by defeat in every branch of music I have )Tj
T*(essayed, I am sure I would have welcomed such a chance".[98] In January 1948 he )Tj
T*(conducted the premiere of his wind band setting of "The Power of Rome and the )Tj
T*(Christian Heart", written for the Goldman Band to celebrate the 70th birthday )Tj
T*(of its founder. Afterwards, Grainger denigrated his own music as "commonplace" )Tj
T*(while praising Darius Milhaud's Suite Fran√ßaise, with which it had shared the )Tj
T*(programme.[99] )Tj
T*( On 10 August 1948, Grainger appeared at the London Proms, playing the piano )Tj
T*(part in his Suite on Danish Folksongs with the London Symphony Orchestra under )Tj
T*(Basil Cameron. On 18 September he attended the Last Night of the Proms, )Tj
T*(standing in the promenade section for Delius's Brigg Fair.[100] Over the next )Tj
T*(few years several friends died: Gardiner in 1950, Quilter and Karen Holten in )Tj
T*(1953. In October 1953 Grainger was operated on for abdominal cancer; his fight )Tj
T*(against this disease would last for the rest of his life.[101] He continued to )Tj
T*(appear at concerts, often in church halls and educational establishments rather )Tj
T*(than major concert venues.[9] In 1954, after his last Carnegie Hall appearance, )Tj
T*(Grainger's long promotion of Grieg's music was recognised when he was awarded )Tj
T*(the St. Olav Medal by King Haakon of Norway.[102] However, a growing bitterness )Tj
T*(was becoming evident in his writings and correspondence; in a letter to his )Tj
T*(lifelong friend, the Danish composer Herman Sandby, he bemoaned the continuing )Tj
T*(ascendency in music of the "German form", and asserted that "all my )Tj
T*(compositional life I have been a leader without followers".[102] )Tj
T*( After 1950 Grainger virtually ceased to compose. His principal creative )Tj
T*(activity in the last decade of his life was his work with Burnett Cross, a )Tj
T*(young physics teacher, on free music machines. The first of these was a )Tj
T*(relatively simple device controlled by an adapted pianola.[103] Next was the )Tj
T*("Estey-reed tone-tool", a form of giant harmonica which, Grainger expectantly )Tj
T*(informed his stepdaughter Elsie in April 1951, would be ready to play free )Tj
T*(music "in a few weeks".[104] A third machine, the "Cross-Grainger )Tj
T*(Kangaroo-pouch", was completed by 1952. Developments in transistor technology )Tj
T*(encouraged Grainger and Cross to begin work on a fourth, entirely electronic )Tj
T*(machine, which was incomplete when Grainger died.[8][103] )Tj

T*(concentration.[106] Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in )Tj
T*(May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC "Concert )Tj
T*(Hour" programme when he played "Handel in the Strand" on the piano. Back home, )Tj
T*(after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter )Tj
T*(concerts season.[107] On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the )Tj
T*(two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence.[108] )Tj
T*(He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by )Tj
T*(illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing )Tj
T*(his skeleton "for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum". )Tj
T*(This wish was not carried out.[109] )Tj
T*( Through the winter of 1959‚Äì60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, )Tj
T*(often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On )Tj
T*(29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, )Tj
T*(New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On )Tj
T*(this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the )Tj
T*(afternoon was, in his own words, "a fiasco".[110][111] Subsequently confined to )Tj
T*(his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in )Tj
T*(August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril )Tj
T*(Scott's early songs.[112] His last letters, written from hospital in December )Tj
T*(1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and )Tj
T*(hallucinations: "I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have )Tj
T*(not succeeded yet."[113] )Tj
T*( Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of )Tj
T*(78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the )Tj
T*(Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes.[8] )Tj
T*(Ella survived him by 18 years; in 1972, aged 83, she married a young archivist, )Tj
T*(Stewart Manville. She died at White Plains on 17 July 1979.[2][114] )Tj
T*( Grainger's own works fall into two categories: original compositions and folk )Tj
T*(music arrangements. Besides these, he wrote many settings of other composers' )Tj
T*(works.[8][9] Despite his conservatory training he rebelled against the )Tj
T*(disciplines of the central European tradition, largely rejecting conventional )Tj
T*(forms such as symphony, sonata, concerto and opera. With few exceptions his )Tj
T*(original compositions are miniatures, lasting between two and eight minutes. )Tj
T*(Only a few of his works originated as piano pieces, though in due course almost )Tj
T*(all of them were, in his phrase, "dished up" in piano versions.[9] )Tj
T*( The conductor John Eliot Gardiner describes Grainger as "a true original in )Tj
T*(terms of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation", whose terseness of )Tj
T*(expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th century Second Viennese )Tj
T*(School and the Italian madrigalists of the 16th and 17th centuries.[115]Malcolm )Tj
T*(Gillies, a Grainger scholar, writes of Grainger's style that "you know it is )Tj
T*('Grainger' when you have heard about one second of a piece".[116] The music's )Tj
T*(most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its texture ‚Äì "the weft of )Tj
T*(the fabric", according to Grainger.[117] Different textures are defined by )Tj
T*(Grainger as "smooth", "grained" and "prickly".[9] )Tj
T*( Grainger was a musical democrat; he believed that in a performance each )Tj
T*(player's role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was )Tj
T*(developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give )Tj
T*(effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger's )Tj
T*(earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of time signature were )Tj
T*(employed in Love Verses from "The Song of Solomon" \(1899\), and Train Music )Tj
T*(\(1901\), long before Stravinsky adopted this practice.[4] In search of specific )Tj
T*(sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, )Tj
T*(theremins, marimbas, musical glasses, harmoniums, banjos, and )Tj

T*(ukuleles.[109][118] In one early concert of folk music, Quilter and Scott were )Tj
T*(conscripted as performers, to whistle various parts.[119] In "Random Round" )Tj
T*(\(1912‚Äì14\), inspired by the communal music-making he had heard in the Pacific )Tj
T*(Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of )Tj
T*(chance into performances; individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make )Tj
T*(random choices from a menu of variations.[9] This experiment in "aleatory" )Tj
T*(composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by )Tj
T*(avant-garde composers such as Berio and Stockhausen.[120] )Tj
T*( The brief "Sea Song" of 1907 was an early attempt by Grainger to write )Tj
T*("beatless" music. This work, initially set over 14 irregular bars and occupying )Tj
T*(about 15 seconds of performing time,[121] was a forerunner of Grainger's free )Tj
T*(music experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: "It seems to me absurd to live )Tj
T*(in an age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves". )Tj
T*(The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of )Tj
T*(eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. "Out in nature )Tj
T*(we hear all kinds of lovely and touching "free" \(non-harmonic\) combinations of )Tj
T*(tones; yet we are unable to take up these beauties ... into the art of music )Tj
T*(because of our archaic notions of harmony".[90] In a 1941 letter to Scott, )Tj
T*(Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works in )Tj
T*(the manner of a Bach oratorio, a Wagner opera or a Brahms symphony, but excused )Tj
T*(this failure on the grounds that all his works prior to the mid-1930s had been )Tj
T*(mere preparations for his free music.[122] )Tj
T*( As a student, Grainger had learned to appreciate the music of Grieg, and came )Tj
T*(to regard the Norwegian as a paragon of Nordic beauty and greatness. Grieg in )Tj
T*(turn described Grainger as a new way forward for English composition, "quite )Tj
T*(different from Elgar, very original". After a lifetime interpreting Grieg's )Tj
T*(works, in 1944 Grainger began adapting the Norwegian's E minor Piano Sonata, )Tj
T*(Op. 7 as a "Grieg-Grainger Symphony", but abandoned the project after writing )Tj
T*(16 bars of music. By this time, Grainger acknowledged that he had not fulfilled )Tj
T*(Grieg's high expectations of him, either as a composer or as a pianist. He also )Tj
T*(reflected on whether it would have been better, from the point of view of his )Tj
T*(development as a composer, had he never met the Griegs, "sweet and dear though )Tj
T*(they were to me".[123] )Tj
T*( Grainger was known for his musical experimentation and did not hesitate to )Tj
T*(exploit the capabilities of the orchestra. Train Music was intended for 150 )Tj
T*(players and Country Gardens has some lush harmonic invention. Perhaps his most )Tj
T*(ambitious work was The Warriors, an 18 minute 'imaginary ballet' of frenzied )Tj
T*('danceable music', entrusted to a huge orchestral ensemble incorporating a )Tj
T*(large 'tuneful percussion' mixture alongside at least three pianos ‚Äì in one )Tj
T*(performance, Grainger used nineteen pianos with thirty pianists ‚Äì to be played )Tj
T*(by "exceptionally strong vigorous players".[124] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Grainger considered himself an Australian composer who, he said, wrote music )Tj
T*("in the hopes of bringing honor and fame to my native land".[125] However, much )Tj
T*(of Grainger's working life was spent elsewhere, and the extent to which he )Tj
T*(influenced Australian music, within his lifetime and thereafter, is )Tj
T*(debatable.[126] His efforts to educate the Australian musical public in the )Tj
T*(mid-1930s were indifferently received, and did not attract disciples;[127] )Tj
T*(writing in 2010, the academic and critic Roger Covell identifies only one )Tj
T*(significant contemporary Australian musician ‚Äì the English-born horn player, )Tj
T*(pianist and conductor David Stanhope ‚Äì working in the Grainger idiom.[126] In )Tj
T*(1956, the suggestion by the composer Keith Humble that Grainger be invited to )Tj
T*(write music for the opening of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne had been )Tj
T*(rejected by the organisers of the Games.[105] )Tj
T*( Grainger was a life-long atheist and believed he would only endure in the body )Tj
T*(of work he left behind.[128] He took an unusual course of action to ensure that )Tj
T*(survival by establishing a personal museum dedicated to his own life. The )Tj
T*(Grainger Museum was given little attention before the mid-1970s;[9] it was )Tj
T*(initially regarded as evidence either of an over-large ego or of extreme )Tj
T*(eccentricity.[129] Since then the University of Melbourne's commitment to the )Tj

T*(museum has, Covell asserts, "rescued [it] permanently from academic denigration )Tj
T*(and belittlement".[129] Its vast quantities of materials have been used to )Tj
T*(investigate not only Grainger's life and works, but those of contemporaries )Tj
T*(whom Grainger had known: Grieg, Delius, Scott and others.[130] The Grainger )Tj
T*(home at 7 Cromwell Place, White Plains, is now the Percy Grainger Library and )Tj
T*(is a further repository of memorabilia and historic performance material, open )Tj
T*(to researchers and visitors.[9][131] )Tj
T*( In Britain, Grainger's main legacy is the revival of interest in folk music. )Tj
T*(His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folksongs greatly )Tj
T*(influenced the following generation of English composers; Benjamin Britten )Tj
T*(acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect.[132] After hearing a )Tj
T*(broadcast of some Grainger settings, Britten reportedly declared that these )Tj
T*("[knocked] all the Vaughan Williams and R. O. Morris arrangements into a cocked )Tj
T*(hat".[133] In the United States, Grainger left a strong educational legacy )Tj
T*(through his involvement, over 40 years, with high school, summer school and )Tj
T*(college students. Likewise, his innovative approaches to instrumentation and )Tj
T*(scoring have left their mark on modern American band music;[9] Timothy Reynish, )Tj
T*(a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America, has described him )Tj
T*(as "the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal, if not )Tj
T*(the superior, in expressive potential to symphony orchestras."[134] Grainger's )Tj
T*(attempts to produce "free music" by mechanical and later electronic means, )Tj
T*(which he considered his most important work, produced no follow-up; they were )Tj
T*(quickly overtaken and nullified by new technological advances. Covell )Tj
T*(nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour, Grainger's dogged resourcefulness )Tj
T*(and ingenious use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian )Tj
T*(aspect of the composer's character ‚Äì one of which Grainger would have been )Tj
T*(proud.[135] )Tj
T*( [edit] Assessment )Tj
T*( In 1945 Grainger devised an informal ratings system for composers and musical )Tj
T*(styles, based on criteria that included originality, complexity and beauty. Of )Tj
T*(forty composers and styles, he ranked himself equal ninth ‚Äì behind Wagner and )Tj
T*(Delius, but well ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky.[123] Nevertheless, in his )Tj
T*(later years he frequently denigrated his career, for example writing to Scott: )Tj
T*("I have never been a true musician or true artist".[136] His failure to be )Tj
T*(recognised as a composer for anything beyond his popular folk-song arrangements )Tj
T*(was a source of frustration and disappointment;[137] for years after his death )Tj
T*(the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed.[138] From the 1990s an )Tj
T*(increase in the number of Grainger recordings has brought a revival of interest )Tj
T*(in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer.[2] An unsigned )Tj
T*(tribute published on the Gramophone website in February 2011 to commemorate the )Tj
T*(50th anniversary of Grainger's death opined that "though he would never be put )Tj
T*(on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and )Tj
T*(deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical )Tj
T*(taste".[109] )Tj
T*( Of Grainger the pianist, The New York Times critic Harold Schonberg wrote that )Tj
T*(his unique style was expressed with "amazing skill, personality and )Tj
T*(vigor".[139] The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances )Tj
T*(became muted in later years, and reviews of his performances during the final )Tj
T*(ten years of his life were often harsh.[140] However, Britten regarded )Tj
T*(Grainger's late recording of the Grieg concerto, from a live performance at )Tj
T*(Aarhus in 1957, as "one of the noblest ever committed to record" ‚Äì despite the )Tj
T*(suppression of the disc for many years, because of the proliferation of wrong )Tj
T*(notes and other faults.[141] Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, referring )Tj
T*(to Grainger's early displays of artistic skills, has speculated that had John )Tj
T*(Grainger's influence not been removed, "Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be )Tj
T*(remembered as one of Australia's leading painters and designers, who just )Tj
T*(happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer".[142] The )Tj
T*(ethnomusicologist John Blacking, while acknowledging Grainger's contribution to )Tj
T*(social and cultural aspects of music, nevertheless writes that if the )Tj
T*(continental foundation of Grainger's musical education had not been "undermined )Tj

T*(ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater".[143] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recordings )Tj
T*( Between 1908 and 1957 Grainger made numerous recordings, usually as pianist or )Tj
T*(conductor, of his own and other composers' music. His first recordings, for The )Tj
T*(Gramophone Company Ltd \(later HMV\), included the cadenza to Grieg's piano )Tj
T*(concerto; he did not record a complete version of this work on disc until 1945. )Tj
T*(Much of his recording work was done between 1917 and 1931, under contract with )Tj
T*(Columbia. At other times he recorded for Decca \(1944‚Äì45 and 1957\), and Vanguard )Tj
T*(\(1957\). Of his own compositions and arrangements, "Country Gardens", )Tj
T*("Shepherd's Hey" and "Molly on the Shore" were recorded most frequently; in )Tj
T*(recordings of other composers, piano works by Bach, Brahms, Chopin, Grieg, )Tj
T*(Liszt and Schumann figure most often.[144] Grainger's complete 78 rpm solo )Tj
T*(piano recordings are now available on compact disc as a CD box set on APR )Tj
T*(records in transfers made by Ward Marston.[145] During his association with the )Tj
T*(Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 piano rolls of )Tj
T*(his own and others' music, many of which have subsequently been transferred to )Tj
T*(CD, using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand piano via an array of )Tj
T*(precision mechanical fingers and feet.[146][147][148] This reproduction system )Tj
T*(allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, )Tj
T*(during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony )Tj
T*(Orchestra in Grieg's Piano Concerto.[149] )Tj
T*( Since Grainger's death, recordings of his works have been undertaken by many )Tj
T*(artists and issued under many different labels. In 1995 Chandos Records began )Tj
T*(to compile a complete recorded edition of Grainger's original compositions and )Tj
T*(folk settings.[150] Of 25 anticipated volumes, 19 had been completed as of )Tj
T*(2010;[151] these were issued as a CD boxed set in 2011, to mark the 50th )Tj
T*(anniversary of the composer's death.[152] )Tj
T*( [edit] Media portrayals )Tj
T*( Percy Grainger has been portrayed on screen more than once. In Song of Summer, )Tj
T*(a 1968 Ken Russell film mainly about Frederick Delius and Eric Fenby, he was )Tj
T*(played by David Collings. Passion \(also known as Passion: The Story of Percy )Tj
T*(Grainger\) was a 1999 Australian biopic about some episodes in Grainger's life )Tj
T*(during the early part of his career. It starred Richard Roxburgh as the )Tj
T*(composer and Barbara Hershey as Rose Grainger. )Tj
T*( [edit] Notes and references )Tj
T*( Notes )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( ^ Although most sources give 1855 as the birth year, the Grainger Museum )Tj
T*(states that 1854 is the correct year.[1])Tj
T*(^ The correspondence was conducted largely in Danish, at which Grainger was )Tj
T*(fluent. His first letter to Holten, dated 12 August 1905, begins "Dear Miss )Tj
T*(Holten"; by the end of the year she is "My dear Karen". During their long )Tj
T*(separations Grainger's letters become a diary of his activities.[44])Tj
T*(^ There is no evidence up to this time that Grainger could play the )Tj
T*(saxophone,[53] but in an official listing of the band's personnel as of April )Tj
T*(1918 he is listed as a saxophone soloist.[54])Tj
T*(^ Some of Grainger's earliest published letters contain anti-Semitic comments, )Tj
T*(for example to Karen Holten in 1905.[77] He later asserted that the Jewish race )Tj
T*(was less capable of producing good music than the Nordic races,[78] and his )Tj
T*(letter to Quilter of 25 February 1939 is cited by Gillies and Pear as an )Tj
T*(example of his racial intolerance.[76][79])Tj
T*(^ In April 1945 Grainger declined an honorary doctorate from McGill University )Tj
T*(in Montreal, on the grounds that having had only three months' formal )Tj
T*(schooling, his music "must be regarded as a product of non-education".[85])Tj

T*( Kitsune \(Áãê?, IPA:¬†[kits…Øne]¬†\( listen\)\) is the Japanese word for fox. Foxes )Tj
T*(are a common subject of Japanese folklore; in English, kitsune refers to them )Tj
T*(in this context. Stories depict them as intelligent beings and as possessing )Tj
T*(magical abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. Foremost among these )Tj
T*(is the ability to assume human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune )Tj
T*(employing this ability to trick others‚Äîas foxes in folklore often do‚Äîother )Tj
T*(stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives. )Tj
T*( Foxes and human beings lived close together in ancient Japan; this )Tj
T*(companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become )Tj
T*(closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its )Tj
T*(messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The )Tj
T*(more tails a kitsune has‚Äîthey may have as many as nine‚Äîthe older, wiser, and )Tj
T*(more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some )Tj
T*(people make offerings to them as to a deity. )Tj
T*( [edit] Origins )Tj
T*( It is widely agreed that many fox myths in Japan can be traced to China, )Tj
T*(Korea, or India. Chinese folk tales tell of fox spirits called huli jing that )Tj
T*(may have up to nine tails, or Ky≈´bi no Kitsune in Japanese. Many of the )Tj
T*(earliest surviving stories are recorded in the Konjaku Monogatari, an )Tj
T*(11th-century collection of Chinese, Indian, and Japanese narratives.[1] )Tj
T*( There is debate whether the kitsune myths originated entirely from foreign )Tj
T*(sources or are in part an indigenous Japanese concept dating as far back as the )Tj
T*(fifth century BC. Japanese folklorist Kiyoshi Nozaki argues that the Japanese )Tj

T*(regarded kitsune positively as early as the 4th century A.D.; the only things )Tj
T*(imported from China or Korea were the kitsune's negative attributes.[2] He )Tj
T*(states that, according to a 16th-century book of records called the Nihon )Tj
T*(Ryakki, foxes and human beings lived close together in ancient Japan, and he )Tj
T*(contends that indigenous legends about the creatures arose as a result.[3]Inari )Tj
T*(scholar Karen Smyers notes that the idea of the fox as seductress and the )Tj
T*(connection of the fox myths to Buddhism were introduced into Japanese folklore )Tj
T*(through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories )Tj
T*(contain elements unique to Japan.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Etymology )Tj
T*( The full etymology is unknown. The oldest known usage of the word is in the )Tj
T*(794 text Shin'yaku Kegonky≈ç Ongi Shiki. Other old sources include Nihon Ry≈çiki )Tj
T*(\(810‚Äì824\) and Wamy≈ç Ruijush≈ç \(c. 934\). These oldest sources are written in )Tj
T*(Man'y≈çgana which clearly identifies the historical spelling as ki1tune. )Tj
T*(Following several diachronic phonological changes, this becomes kitsune. )Tj
T*( Many etymological suggestions have been made, though there is no general )Tj
T*(agreement: )Tj
T*( My≈çgoki \(1268\) suggests that it is so called because it is "always \(tsune\) )Tj
T*(yellow \(ki\)".)Tj
T*(Early Kamakura period Mizukagami indicates that it means "came \(ki\) [ )Tj
T*(perfective aspect particle tsu] to bedroom \(ne\)" due to a legend that a kitsune )Tj
T*(would change into one's wife and bear children.)Tj
T*(Arai Hakuseki in T≈çga \(1717\) suggests that ki means "stench", tsu is a )Tj
T*(possessive particle, and ne is related to inu, the word for "dog".)Tj
T*(Tanikawa Kotosuga in Wakun no Shiori \(1777‚Äì1887\) suggests that ki means )Tj
T*("yellow", tsu is a possessive particle, and ne is related to neko, the word for )Tj
T*(cat.)Tj
T*(≈åtsuki Fumihiko in Daigenkai \(1932‚Äì1935\) proposes that kitsu is an onomatopoeia )Tj
T*(for the animal, and that ne is an affix or an honorific word meaning a servant )Tj
T*(of an Inari shrine.)Tj
T*(  According to Nozaki, the word kitsune was originally onomatopoetic.[3]Kitsu )Tj
T*(represented a fox's yelp and came to be the general word for fox. -Ne signifies )Tj
T*(an affectionate mood, which Nozaki presents as further evidence of an )Tj
T*(established, non-imported tradition of benevolent foxes in Japanese )Tj
T*(folklore.[2]Kitsu is now archaic; in modern Japanese, a fox's cry is )Tj
T*(transcribed as kon kon or gon gon. )Tj
T*( One of the oldest surviving kitsune tales provides a widely known folk )Tj
T*(etymology of the word kitsune.[5] Unlike most tales of kitsune who become human )Tj
T*(and marry human males, this one does not end tragically:[6][7] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Ono, an inhabitant of Mino \(says an ancient Japanese legend of A.D. 545\), spent )Tj
T*(the seasons longing for his ideal of female beauty. He met her one evening on a )Tj
T*(vast moor and married her. Simultaneously with the birth of their son, Ono's )Tj
T*(dog was delivered of a pup which as it grew up became more and more hostile to )Tj
T*(the lady of the moors. She begged her husband to kill it, but he refused. At )Tj
T*(last one day the dog attacked her so furiously that she lost courage, resumed )Tj
T*(vulpine shape, leaped over a fence and fled.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*("You may be a fox," Ono called after her, "but you are the mother of my son and )Tj
T*(I love you. Come back when you please; you will always be welcome.")Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(So every evening she stole back and slept in his arms.[5])Tj
T*(  Because the fox returns to her husband each night as a woman but leaves each )Tj
T*(morning as a fox, she is called Kitsune. In classical Japanese, kitsu-ne means )Tj
T*(come and sleep, and ki-tsune means always comes.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Characteristics )Tj
T*( Kitsune are believed to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical )Tj
T*(powers. They are a type of y≈çkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is )Tj
T*(often translated as fox spirit. However, this does not mean that kitsune are )Tj
T*(ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because )Tj

T*(the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all )Tj
T*(long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.[4] )Tj
T*( There are two common classifications of kitsune. The zenko \(ÂñÑÁãê?, literally )Tj
T*(good foxes\) are benevolent, celestial foxes associated with the god Inari; they )Tj
T*(are sometimes simply called Inari foxes. On the other hand, the yako \(ÈáéÁãê?, )Tj
T*(literally field foxes, also called nogitsune\) tend to be mischievous or even )Tj
T*(malicious.[8] Local traditions add further types.[9] For example, a ninko is an )Tj
T*(invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it possesses )Tj
T*(them. Another tradition classifies kitsune into one of thirteen types defined )Tj
T*(by which supernatural abilities the kitsune possesses. )Tj
T*( Physically, kitsune are noted for having as many as nine tails.[10] Generally, )Tj
T*(a greater number of tails indicates an older and more powerful fox; in fact, )Tj
T*(some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has )Tj
T*(lived 100 years.[11] One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common )Tj
T*(numbers in folk stories.[12] When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur )Tj
T*(becomes white or gold.[10] These ky≈´bi no kitsune \(‰πùÂ∞æ„ÅÆÁãê?, nine-tailed )Tj
T*(foxes\) gain the abilities to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the )Tj
T*(world. Other tales attribute them infinite wisdom \(omniscience\).[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Shapeshifting )Tj
T*( A kitsune may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain )Tj
T*(age‚Äîusually 100 years, although some tales say 50.[11] As a common prerequisite )Tj
T*(for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a broad leaf, or a skull over )Tj
T*(its head.[14] Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young )Tj
T*(girls, or elderly men. These shapes are not limited by the fox's age or )Tj
T*(gender,[4] and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person.[15] )Tj
T*(Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common )Tj
T*(belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at )Tj
T*(dusk or night, could be a fox.[16]Kitsune-gao or fox-faced refers to human )Tj
T*(females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and high )Tj
T*(cheekbones. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and )Tj
T*(some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form.[17] Variants on the theme have )Tj
T*(the kitsune retain other foxlike traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a )Tj
T*(fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.[18] )Tj
T*( In some stories, kitsune have difficulty hiding their tails when they take )Tj
T*(human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, )Tj
T*(is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature.[19] A particularly )Tj
T*(devout individual may in some cases even be able to see through a fox's )Tj
T*(disguise merely by perceiving them.[20] Kitsune may also be exposed while in )Tj
T*(human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by )Tj
T*(their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee. )Tj
T*( One folk story illustrating these imperfections in the kitsune's human shape )Tj
T*(concerns Koan, a historical person credited with wisdom and magical powers of )Tj
T*(divination. According to the story, he was staying at the home of one of his )Tj
T*(devotees when he scalded his foot entering a bath because the water had been )Tj
T*(drawn too hot. Then, "in his pain, he ran out of the bathroom naked. When the )Tj
T*(people of the household saw him, they were astonished to see that Koan had fur )Tj
T*(covering much of his body, along with a fox's tail. Then Koan transformed in )Tj
T*(front of them, becoming an elderly fox and running away."[21] )Tj
T*( Other supernatural abilities commonly attributed to the kitsune include )Tj
T*(possession, mouths or tails that generate fire or lightning \(known as )Tj
T*(kitsune-bi; literally, fox-fire\), willful manifestation in the dreams of )Tj
T*(others, flight, invisibility, and the creation of illusions so elaborate as to )Tj
T*(be almost indistinguishable from reality.[14][18] Some tales speak of kitsune )Tj
T*(with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or )Tj
T*(take fantastic shapes such as a tree of incredible height or a second moon in )Tj
T*(the sky.[22][23] Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or )Tj
T*(succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through )Tj
T*(sexual contact.[24] )Tj

T*(the state of being possessed by a fox. The victim is always a young woman, whom )Tj
T*(the fox enters beneath her fingernails or through her breasts.[25] In some )Tj
T*(cases, the victims' facial expressions are said to change in such a way that )Tj
T*(they resemble those of a fox. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can )Tj
T*(cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read.[26] Though )Tj
T*(foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, Kitsunetsuki is often )Tj
T*(attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers, or )Tj
T*(tsukimono-suji.[27] )Tj
T*( Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in the first volume of his )Tj
T*(Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes enter. Sometimes they run )Tj
T*(naked shouting through the streets. Sometimes they lie down and froth at the )Tj
T*(mouth, and yelp as a fox yelps. And on some part of the body of the possessed a )Tj
T*(moving lump appears under the skin, which seems to have a life of its own. )Tj
T*(Prick it with a needle, and it glides instantly to another place. By no grasp )Tj
T*(can it be so tightly compressed by a strong hand that it will not slip from )Tj
T*(under the fingers. Possessed folk are also said to speak and write languages of )Tj
T*(which they were totally ignorant prior to possession. They eat only what foxes )Tj
T*(are believed to like¬†‚Äî tofu, aburag√©, azukimeshi, etc.¬†‚Äî and they eat a great )Tj
T*(deal, alleging that not they, but the possessing foxes, are hungry.[28])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( He goes on to note that, once freed from the possession, the victim will never )Tj
T*(again be able to eat tofu, azukimeshi, or other foods favored by foxes: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Exorcism, often performed at an Inari shrine, may induce a fox to leave its )Tj
T*(host.[29] In the past, when such gentle measures failed or a priest was not )Tj
T*(available, victims of kitsunetsuki were beaten or badly burned in hopes of )Tj
T*(forcing the fox to leave. Entire families were ostracized by their communities )Tj
T*(after a member of the family was thought to be possessed.[28])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In Japan, kitsunetsuki was noted as a disease as early as the Heian period and )Tj
T*(remained a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th )Tj
T*(century.[30][31] Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior )Tj
T*(displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi )Tj
T*(Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered )Tj
T*(kitsunetsuki.[32] The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession )Tj
T*(still occur, such as allegations that members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had )Tj
T*(been possessed.[33] )Tj
T*( In medicine, kitsunetsuki is a culture-bound syndrome unique to Japanese )Tj
T*(culture. Those who suffer from the condition believe they are possessed by a )Tj
T*(fox.[34] Symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet red beans, listlessness, )Tj
T*(restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. Kitsunetsuki is similar to but )Tj
T*(distinct from clinical lycanthropy.[35] )Tj
T*( [edit] Hoshi no tama \(„Åª„Åó„ÅÆ„Åü„Åæ\) )Tj
T*( Depictions of kitsune or their possessed victims may feature round or )Tj
T*(onion-shaped white balls known as hoshi no tama \(star balls\). Tales describe )Tj
T*(these as glowing with kitsune-bi, or fox-fire.[36] Some stories identify them )Tj
T*(as magical jewels or pearls.[37] When not in human form or possessing a human, )Tj
T*(a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail.[11] Jewels are )Tj
T*(a common symbol of Inari, and representations of sacred Inari foxes without )Tj
T*(them are rare.[38] )Tj
T*( One belief is that when a kitsune changes shape, its hoshi no tama holds a )Tj
T*(portion of its magical power. Another tradition is that the pearl represents )Tj
T*(the kitsune's soul; the kitsune will die if separated from it for long. Those )Tj
T*(who obtain the ball may be able to extract a promise from the kitsune to help )Tj
T*(them in exchange for its return.[39] For example, a 12th-century tale describes )Tj
T*(a man using a fox's hoshi no tama to secure a favor: )Tj

T*( [edit] Portrayal )Tj
T*( [edit] Servants of Inari )Tj
T*( Kitsune are associated with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice.[41] This )Tj
T*(association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance.[42] Originally, )Tj
T*(kitsune were Inari's messengers, but the line between the two is now blurred so )Tj
T*(that Inari itself may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are )Tj
T*(dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave offerings.[9] Fox spirits are )Tj
T*(said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called aburage, which is )Tj
T*(accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. )Tj
T*(Similarly, Inari-zushi is a type of sushi named for Inari that consists of )Tj
T*(rice-filled pouches of fried tofu.[43] There is speculation among folklorists )Tj
T*(as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long )Tj
T*(been worshipped as kami.[44] )Tj
T*( Inari's kitsune are white, a color of good omen.[9] They possess the power to )Tj
T*(ward off evil, and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits. In addition to )Tj
T*(protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene on behalf of the )Tj
T*(locals and particularly to aid against troublesome nogitsune, those spirit )Tj
T*(foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise )Tj
T*(considered good omens.[19] )Tj
T*( According to beliefs derived from fusui \(feng shui\), the fox's power over evil )Tj
T*(is such that a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil kimon, or energy, that )Tj
T*(flows from the northeast. Many Inari shrines, such as the famous Fushimi Inari )Tj
T*(shrine in Kyoto, feature such statues, sometimes large numbers of them. )Tj
T*( Kitsune are connected to the Buddhist religion through the Dakiniten, )Tj
T*(goddesses conflated with Inari's female aspect. Dakiniten is depicted as a )Tj
T*(female boddhisattva wielding a sword and riding a flying white fox.[45] )Tj
T*( [edit] Tricksters )Tj
T*( Kitsune are often presented as tricksters, with motives that vary from )Tj
T*(mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud )Tj
T*(samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse )Tj
T*(poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually )Tj
T*(men; women are possessed instead.[16] For example, kitsune are thought to )Tj
T*(employ their kitsune-bi or fox-fire to lead travelers astray in the manner of a )Tj
T*(will o' the wisp.[46][47] Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its )Tj
T*(target with illusions or visions.[16] Other common goals of trickster kitsune )Tj
T*(include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for )Tj
T*(a perceived slight. )Tj
T*( A traditional game called kitsune-ken \(fox-fist\) references the kitsune's )Tj
T*(powers over human beings. The game is similar to rock, paper, scissors, but the )Tj
T*(three hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The )Tj
T*(headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he )Tj
T*(shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.[48][49] )Tj
T*( This ambiguous portrayal, coupled with their reputation for vengefulness, )Tj
T*(leads people to try to discover a troublesome fox's motives. In one case, the )Tj
T*(16th-century leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi wrote a letter to the kami Inari: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(To Inari Daimyojin,)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(My lord, I have the honor to inform you that one of the foxes under your )Tj
T*(jurisdiction has bewitched one of my servants, causing her and others a great )Tj
T*(deal of trouble. I have to request that you make minute inquiries into the )Tj
T*(matter, and endeavor to find out the reason of your subject misbehaving in this )Tj
T*(way, and let me know the result.)Tj

T*(If it turns out that the fox has no adequate reason to give for his behavior, )Tj
T*(you are to arrest and punish him at once. If you hesitate to take action in )Tj
T*(this matter I shall issue orders for the destruction of every fox in the land. )Tj
T*(Any other particulars that you may wish to be informed of in reference to what )Tj
T*(has occurred, you can learn from the high priest of Yoshida.[50])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Kitsune keep their promises and strive to repay any favor. Occasionally a )Tj
T*(kitsune attaches itself to a person or household, where they can cause all )Tj
T*(sorts of mischief. In one story from the 12th century, only the homeowner's )Tj
T*(threat to exterminate the foxes convinces them to behave. The kitsune patriarch )Tj
T*(appears in the man's dreams: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*("My father lived here before me, sir, and by now I have many children and )Tj
T*(grandchildren. They get into a lot of mischief, I'm afraid, and I'm always )Tj
T*(after them to stop, but they never listen. And now, sir, you're understandably )Tj
T*(fed up with us. I gather that you're going to kill us all. But I just want you )Tj
T*(to know, sir, how sorry I am that this is our last night of life. Won't you )Tj
T*(pardon us, one more time? If we ever make trouble again, then of course you )Tj
T*(must act as you think best. But the young ones, sir¬†‚Äî I'm sure they'll )Tj
T*(understand when I explain to them why you're so upset. We'll do everything we )Tj
T*(can to protect you from now on, if only you'll forgive us, and we'll be sure to )Tj
T*(let you know when anything good is going to happen!"[51])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Other kitsune use their magic for the benefit of their companion or hosts as )Tj
T*(long as the human beings treat them with respect. As y≈çkai, however, kitsune do )Tj
T*(not share human morality, and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner )Tj
T*(may, for example, bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the )Tj
T*(neighbors. Accordingly, common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated )Tj
T*(with suspicion.[52] Oddly, samurai families were often reputed to share similar )Tj
T*(arrangements with kitsune, but these foxes were considered zenko and the use of )Tj
T*(their magic a sign of prestige.[53] Abandoned homes were common haunts for )Tj
T*(kitsune.[16] One 12th-century story tells of a minister moving into an old )Tj
T*(mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there. They first try to )Tj
T*(scare him away, then claim that the house "has been ours for many years, and . )Tj
T*(. . we wish to register a vigorous protest." The man refuses, and the foxes )Tj
T*(resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby.[54] )Tj
T*( Tales distinguish kitsune gifts from kitsune payments. If a kitsune offers a )Tj
T*(payment or reward that includes money or material wealth, part or all of the )Tj
T*(sum will consist of old paper, leaves, twigs, stones, or similar valueless )Tj
T*(items under a magical illusion.[55][56] True kitsune gifts are usually )Tj
T*(intangibles, such as protection, knowledge, or long life.[56] )Tj
T*( [edit] Wives and lovers )Tj
T*( Kitsune are commonly portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young )Tj
T*(human male and a kitsune who takes the form of a human woman.[57] The kitsune )Tj
T*(may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature.[58] )Tj
T*(Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted )Tj
T*(wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is )Tj
T*(forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, )Tj
T*(filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his )Tj
T*(abandoned family in shame. )Tj
T*( Many stories tell of fox-wives bearing children. When such progeny are human, )Tj
T*(they possess special physical or supernatural qualities that often pass to )Tj
T*(their own children.[19] The astrologer-magician Abe no Seimei was reputed to )Tj
T*(have inherited such extraordinary powers.[59] )Tj
T*( Other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain falling from a clear )Tj
T*(sky¬†‚Äî a sunshower¬†‚Äî is called kitsune no yomeiri or the kitsune's wedding, in )Tj
T*(reference to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures )Tj
T*(being held during such conditions.[60] The event is considered a good omen, but )Tj
T*(the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests,[61] as is depicted in )Tj
T*(Akira Kurosawa's film Dreams.[62] )Tj

T*( Stephen Turnbull, in "Nagashino 1575", relates the tale of the Takeda clan's )Tj
T*(involvement with a fox-woman. The warlord Takeda Shingen, in 1544, defeated in )Tj
T*(battle a lesser local warlord named Suwa Yorishige and drove him to suicide )Tj
T*(after a "humiliating and spurious" peace conference, after which Shingen forced )Tj
T*(marriage on Suwa Yorishige's beautiful 14-year-old daughter Lady Koi‚ÄîShingen's )Tj
T*(own niece. Shingen, Turnbull writes, "was so obsessed with the girl that his )Tj
T*(superstitious followers became alarmed and believed her to be an incarnation of )Tj
T*(the white fox-spirit of the Suwa Shrine, who had bewitched him in order to gain )Tj
T*(revenge." When their son Takeda Katsuyori proved to be a disastrous leader and )Tj
T*(led the clan to their devastating defeat at the battle of Nagashino, Turnbull )Tj
T*(writes, "wise old heads nodded, remembering the unhappy circumstances of his )Tj
T*(birth and his magical mother". )Tj
T*( [edit] In fiction )Tj
T*( Embedded in Japanese folklore as they are, kitsune appear in numerous Japanese )Tj
T*(works. Noh, kyogen, bunraku, and kabuki plays derived from folk tales feature )Tj
T*(them,[63][64] as do contemporary works such as anime, manga and video games. In )Tj
T*(fact, Luigi's White Tannoki outfit is known as "White Kitsune Luigi." Such )Tj
T*(well-known fictional Kitsune include the fox demon Kurama from Yu Yu Hakusho )Tj
T*(and Naruto, and Miles "Tails" Prower from Sonic the Hedgehog series. The )Tj
T*(Pok√©mon characters Vulpix and Ninetales, Zorua and Zoroark, and Fennekin are )Tj
T*(based on the kitsune. Also, Crazy Redd from the Animal Crossing series is based )Tj
T*(off of the kitsune as well. Western authors of fiction have begun to make use )Tj
T*(of the kitsune legends.[65] In ≈åkami, there is is a group of demons called the )Tj
T*(Pot Foxes which are found inside the Water Dragon. These are based off of )Tj
T*(Kitsune. Also in Okami is the Demon Lord Ninetails, who possesses nine tails )Tj
T*(and is also a kitsune, being the lord of Ryoshima. Although these portrayals )Tj
T*(vary considerably, kitsune are generally depicted in accordance with folk )Tj
T*(stories, as wise, cunning, and powerful beings. )Tj

T*( Green became one of London's much-loved eccentrics, though his campaign to )Tj
T*(suppress desire, as one commentator put it, was not invariably popular, leading )Tj
T*(to two arrests for obstruction and the need to wear green overalls to protect )Tj
T*(himself from spit. He nevertheless took great delight in his local fame. The )Tj
T*(Sunday Times interviewed him in 1985, and his "less passion, less protein" )Tj
T*(slogan was used by Red or Dead, the London fashion house. When he died at the )Tj
T*(age of 78, The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The Times published his )Tj
T*(obituary, and his pamphlets, placards and letters were passed to the Museum of )Tj
T*(London. David McKie writes that in 2006 Green achieved what no other human )Tj

T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Green was born in Harringay, north London, the youngest of four sons of )Tj
T*(Richard Green, a clerk for a bottle stopper manufacturer, and his wife, May. He )Tj
T*(attended Wood Green School before joining the Royal Navy in 1938, and fought in )Tj
T*(the Second World War until he left the Navy in September 1945.[3] )Tj
T*( Philip Carter writes in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that )Tj
T*(Green's time with the Navy affected him deeply. He was reportedly shocked by )Tj
T*(the sailors' obsession with sex, and by 1958 had come to believe that their )Tj
T*(libido had been dangerously heightened by the intake of too much protein.[3] "I )Tj
T*(was astonished when things were said quite openly ‚Äì what a husband would say to )Tj

T*( After the war he took a job with the Fine Art Society, and it was while )Tj
T*(working there in March 1946 that he failed the entrance exam for the University )Tj
T*(of London. He later worked for Selfridges and the civil service, and as a )Tj
T*(storeman for Ealing Borough Council.[3] He said that he had lost jobs because )Tj
T*(on two occasions he had refused to be dishonest.[5] In 1962 he worked for the )Tj
T*(post office, then became a self-employed gardener, and seems to have earned his )Tj
T*(living that way until he started his full-time anti-protein campaign in 1968. )Tj
T*(He lived with his parents until they died ‚Äì his father in 1966 and his mother )Tj

T*( [edit] His mission )Tj
T*( [edit] On the streets )Tj
T*( He began his mission in June 1968, at the age of 53, initially in Harrow on )Tj
T*(Saturdays, becoming a full-time human billboard six months later on Oxford )Tj
T*(Street. He cycled there from Northolt with a sandwich board attached to the )Tj
T*(bicycle, a journey of 12 miles \(19¬†km\) that could take up to two hours, until )Tj
T*(he was given a free bus pass when he turned 65.[4] )Tj
T*( He rose early, and after porridge for breakfast made bread that would rise )Tj
T*(while he was out on patrol, ready for his evening meal. He then prepared his )Tj
T*(lunch on a Bunsen burner, eating at 2:30 in a "warm and secret place" near )Tj
T*(Oxford Street.[4] He walked up and down the street six days a week, reduced to )Tj
T*(four days from 1985 onwards, campaigning until 6:30 pm among the shoppers. )Tj
T*(Saturday evenings he would spend with the cinema crowds in Leicester Square.[3] )Tj
T*(He would to go to bed at 12:30 am, after saying a prayer. "Quite a good prayer, )Tj
T*(unselfish too," he told The Sunday Times. "It is a sort of acknowledgment of )Tj
T*(God, just in case there happens to be one."[4] )Tj
T*( Peter Ackroyd wrote in London: The Biography that Green was for the most part )Tj
T*(ignored, becoming "a poignant symbol of the city's incuriosity and )Tj
T*(forgetfulness."[6] His advice to young women that they should eat a low-protein )Tj
T*(diet ‚Äì because "you cannot deceive your groom that you are a virgin on your )Tj
T*(wedding night!"[7] ‚Äì was not always appreciated, and led to his being arrested )Tj
T*(twice for public obstruction, once in 1980 and again in 1985.[3] "The injustice )Tj
T*(of it upsets me," he told The Sunday Times, "because I'm doing such a good )Tj
T*(job." He took to wearing overalls to protect himself from spit, several times )Tj
T*(finding it on his hat after a day's work.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] In writing )Tj
T*( Sundays were spent at home, not always quietly, with the printing press on )Tj
T*(which Eight Passion Proteins was produced. It was described by Waldemar )Tj
T*(Januszczak as worthy of the cartoonist Heath Robinson ‚Äì who became known for )Tj
T*(his drawings of ancient contraptions[8] ‚Äì and the racket it made on print days )Tj
T*(caused trouble between Green and his neighbours.[7] )Tj
T*( Eight Passion Proteins went through 52 editions between 1973 and 1993, and was )Tj
T*(noted for its eccentric typography, including the apparently random )Tj
T*(capitalization of words.[9] Raising the price only slightly over the years, )Tj
T*(from 10 pence in 1980 to 12 pence 13 years later, Green sold 20 copies on )Tj
T*(weekdays and up to 50 on Saturdays, a total of 87,000 copies by February )Tj
T*(1993.[3] )Tj
T*( The booklet identified the eight "passion-proteins" as meat, fish, birds, )Tj
T*(cheese, eggs, peas, beans, and nuts, arguing that "those who do not have to )Tj
T*(work hard with their limbs, and those who are inclined to sit about," will )Tj
T*("store up their protein for passion," making retirement, for example, a period )Tj
T*(of increased passion and, therefore, marital discord. "We should not let )Tj
T*(passion defeat us," his pamphlet advised, "either alone or with a sexual )Tj
T*(friend, for discipline in the single years prepares us for the discipline of )Tj
T*(marriage." He singled out the BBC for particular criticism, accusing it of )Tj
T*(spreading "indiscretion, indiscipline, and indecency."[10] )Tj

T*(than Just a Tale, which Carter describes as a "colourful account of the danger )Tj

T*( Triaenops menamena is a bat in the genus Triaenops found on Madagascar, mainly )Tj
T*(in the drier regions. It was known as Triaenops rufus until 2009, when it was )Tj
T*(discovered that that name had been incorrectly applied to the species. )Tj
T*(Triaenops rufus is in fact a synonym of Triaenops persicus, a Middle Eastern )Tj
T*(species closely related to T.¬†menamena‚Äîindeed, the Malagasy species had )Tj
T*(previously been placed as a subspecies of T.¬†persicus by some authors. )Tj
T*(Triaenops menamena is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other )Tj
T*(habitats. It often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as )Tj
T*(butterflies and moths. Because of its wide range, common occurrence, and )Tj
T*(tolerance of habitat degradation, it is not considered to be threatened. )Tj
T*( With a forearm length of 50 to 56¬†mm \(2.0 to 2.2¬†in\) in males and 46 to 53¬†mm )Tj
T*(\(1.8 to 2.1¬†in\) in females, this is a medium-sized bat. Its fur color is )Tj
T*(variable, ranging from reddish-brown to gray, but it is generally darker than )Tj
T*(the species in the closely related genus Paratriaenops which also occur on )Tj
T*(Madagascar. The skull contains a pronounced swelling around the nose and the )Tj
T*(second upper premolar is displaced outside the toothrow. The maximum frequency )Tj
T*(of the echolocation call averages 94.2¬†kHz and the species can easily be )Tj
T*(recognized on the basis of its call. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy )Tj
T*( In 1881, Alphonse Milne-Edwards described two new species in the genus )Tj
T*(Triaenops on the basis of specimens supposedly collected by L√©on Humblot on )Tj
T*(Madagascar: the reddish Triaenops rufus and the larger, gray T. )Tj
T*(humbloti.[2]Jean Dorst, who reviewed Madagascan Triaenops in 1947, retained )Tj
T*(both as separate species; however, in another review, published in 1982, John )Tj
T*(Edwards Hill considered the two to represent the same species. In 1994, Karl )Tj
T*(Koopman considered rufus itself to be part of the Middle Eastern and mainland )Tj
T*(African species Triaenops persicus, a possibility Hill had discussed,[3] but )Tj
T*(most authors regarded the two as distinct species.[4] In 2006, Julie Ranivo and )Tj
T*(Steven Goodman revised Madagascan Triaenops and found little variation among )Tj
T*(specimens of T.¬†rufus from throughout the dry parts of the island.[5] Three )Tj
T*(years later, they published another paper which showed that the original )Tj
T*(material of T.¬†rufus and T.¬†humbloti was distinct from Madagascan specimens )Tj
T*(identified as "Triaenops rufus" and more similar to T.¬†persicus.[6] On his )Tj
T*(journey to Madagascar, Humblot had stayed in Somalia and Yemen, and Goodman and )Tj
T*(Ranivo concluded that he had probably collected the Triaenops there, after )Tj
T*(which their provenance was incorrectly recorded.[7] Thus, rufus and humbloti )Tj
T*(cannot be used for the Madagascan species, and Goodman and Ranivo proposed the )Tj
T*(new name Triaenops menamena for the species formerly known as T.¬†rufus. The )Tj

T*(specific name menamena is Malagasy for "reddish", referring to the animal's )Tj
T*(coloration.[8] "Rufous Trident Bat" has been used as a common name for )Tj
T*(Triaenops rufus.[1] )Tj
T*( Triaenops menamena is currently one of four living species in the genus )Tj
T*(Triaenops; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African )Tj
T*(T.¬†afer and the Yemeni T.¬†parvus from T.¬†persicus and removed three other )Tj
T*(species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus Paratriaenops.[9] )Tj
T*(An extinct species, Triaenops goodmani, is known from northwestern )Tj
T*(Madagascar.[10] In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used phylogenetic )Tj
T*(and coalescent methodologies to investigate the history of the Triaenops group. )Tj
T*(They found that T.¬†menamena \(as T.¬†rufus\) was closest to mainland African )Tj
T*(Triaenops \(but did not study Middle Eastern bats\) and concluded that T.¬†)Tj
T*(menamena and the species of Paratriaenops \(then still placed in Triaenops\) )Tj
T*(independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by )Tj
T*(T.¬†menamena was dated to about 660,000 years ago.[11] Benda and Vallo also )Tj
T*(studied phylogenetic relationships in Triaenops and included Middle Eastern T.¬†)Tj
T*(persicus and T.¬†parvus in their analysis. They found little resolution of )Tj
T*(relationships within Triaenops, but some evidence suggested that T.¬†menamena is )Tj
T*(more closely related to the Middle Eastern species than to T.¬†afer in mainland )Tj
T*(Africa; therefore, T.¬†menamena may have reached Madagascar from the Middle East )Tj
T*(or northeastern Africa. They also placed the split between T.¬†menamena and the )Tj
T*(other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.[12] )Tj

T*(are more equal in Paratriaenops.[18] The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, )Tj
T*(horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process.[19] )Tj
T*(The ears are small and broad[17] and contain notches on the inner side.[14] The )Tj
T*(fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6¬†mm long. The wing )Tj
T*(membrane is dark and translucent and the end of the tail usually projects from )Tj
T*(the uropatagium \(tail membrane\).[19] Males average slightly larger than )Tj
T*(females.[20] Wingspan is 270 to 305¬†mm \(10.6 to 12.0¬†in\).[21] )Tj
T*( The skull is similar to that of Madagascan Paratriaenops, but the premaxilla )Tj
T*(is longer. The rostrum \(front part of the skull\) is well-developed and contains )Tj
T*(a pronounced nasal swelling, which is less pronounced than in Paratriaenops; )Tj
T*(the depression behind the swelling is relatively shallow.[22] Compared to other )Tj
T*(species of Triaenops, the rostrum is relatively narrow and short, similar to T.¬†)Tj
T*(parvus; T.¬†afer and T.¬†persicus have a broader rostrum.[15] The front margin of )Tj
T*(the rostrum is cast back between the left and right corners. A transverse line )Tj
T*(passes over the roof of the rostrum.[22] The infraorbital foramen, an opening )Tj
T*(in the skull, is oblong in shape. The zygomatic arches \(cheekbones\) are not )Tj
T*(broadened towards the sides, are connected to the maxillaries by broad bones, )Tj
T*(and contain clear crests on their upper sides. In T.¬†menamena, these crests are )Tj
T*(rectangular in form and larger than in Paratriaenops.[23] The braincase is )Tj
T*(lower than in other species of Triaenops.[24] The sagittal crest, which is on )Tj
T*(the roof of the braincase, is poorly developed.[23] In the mandible, the )Tj
T*(coronoid process is blunt and rounded, but the angular process \(both processes )Tj
T*(at the back of the bone\) is small.[25] )Tj
T*( The upper incisors have two cusps and the upper canine has three‚Äîa large )Tj
T*(central one, a small but well-developed one at the back, and a small cuspule at )Tj
T*(the front.[25] The front upper premolar is projected outside the toothrow, so )Tj
T*(that the canine before it and back premolar behind it touch.[14] The first )Tj
T*(lower incisor has two cusps and the second has three.[25] On the second lower )Tj
T*(molar, the protoconid cusp is notably taller than the hypoconid; these cusps )Tj
T*(are about as high in T.¬†goodmani.[16] )Tj
T*( The species can easily be identified from recordings of its echolocation )Tj
T*(call.[26] The call consists of a component with constant frequency followed by )Tj
T*(a short one with changing frequency. The call takes 6.5 to 13.5¬†ms, averaging )Tj
T*(10.1¬†ms, and the period between two calls is 22.7 to 86.3¬†ms, averaging 42.7¬†)Tj
T*(ms. The maximum frequency averages 94.2¬†kHz, the minimum frequency averages )Tj
T*(82.0¬†kHz, and the call emits the most energy at a frequency of 93.2¬†kHz.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and ecology )Tj
T*( Triaenops menamena mainly occurs in the dry regions of western Madagascar, but )Tj
T*(has also been recorded in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast,[8] )Tj
T*(and is found up to 1300¬†m \(4300¬†ft\) above sea level.[1] It mainly occurs in )Tj
T*(forests,[28] but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on )Tj
T*(it.[1] An obligate cave dweller,[29] it is known to roost in large colonies, )Tj
T*(with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also )Tj
T*(contained an estimated 10,000 Paratriaenops furculus.[30] The effective )Tj
T*(population size of the species is estimated to be about 121,000.[31]Lepidoptera )Tj
T*(\(butterflies and moths\) form the main component of its diet, but it also eats )Tj
T*(Coleoptera \(beetles\) and Hemiptera \(bugs\) and fewer members of some other )Tj
T*(insect orders.[32] It is unclear how the ecological niches of Triaenops and the )Tj
T*(less frequently captured Paratriaenops furculus are separated, as both eat )Tj
T*(lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Conservation status )Tj
T*( Under Triaenops rufus, the IUCN Red List lists this species as "Least )Tj
T*(Concern", citing its common occurrence over a wide distribution and tolerance )Tj
T*(of human modifications of its habitat, even though its forest habitat is being )Tj
T*(destroyed in places. It has been recorded in numerous protected areas.[1] Bats, )Tj
T*(mainly the large Hipposideros commersoni, are sometimes hunted for food in )Tj
T*(southwestern Madagascar, and T.¬†menamena is also taken incidentally.[34] )Tj

T*( After a flight home from a business trip, the narrator finds his apartment )Tj
T*(destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler Durden \(Pitt\), a soap salesman whom )Tj
T*(he befriended on the flight, and they meet at a bar. A conversation about )Tj
T*(consumerism leads to Tyler inviting the narrator to stay at his place; outside )Tj
T*(the bar he requests that the narrator hit him. The two engage in a fistfight, )Tj
T*(and the narrator subsequently moves into Tyler's dilapidated house. They have )Tj

T*(moves to the bar's basement where the men form a "fight club". )Tj
T*( Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the narrator for help; he ignores her, )Tj
T*(but Tyler answers the call and saves her. Tyler and Marla become sexually )Tj

T*(fight clubs form across the country, and under Tyler's leadership, they become )Tj
T*(the anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization called "Project Mayhem". )Tj
T*(The narrator complains to Tyler that he wants to be more involved in the )Tj

T*(killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the narrator tries to )Tj

T*( Fincher said Fight Club was a coming of age film, like the 1967 film The )Tj
T*(Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an )Tj
T*("everyman";[3] the character is identified in the script as "Jack", but left )Tj
T*(unnamed in the film.[4] Fincher outlined the narrator's background: "He's tried )Tj
T*(to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming )Tj
T*(the thing he isn't." The narrator cannot find happiness, so he travels on a )Tj
T*(path to enlightenment in which he must "kill" his parents, his god, and his )Tj
T*(teacher. At the start of the film, he has killed his parents. With Tyler )Tj
T*(Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To )Tj
T*(complete the process of maturing, the narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler )Tj
T*(Durden.[5] )Tj
T*( The character is a 1990s inverse of The Graduate archetype: "a guy who does )Tj
T*(not have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he )Tj
T*(literally cannot imagine a way to change his life". He is confused and enraged, )Tj
T*(so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean )Tj
T*(√úbermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the narrator would want to be, he )Tj
T*(is not empathetic and does not help the narrator face decisions in his life )Tj
T*("that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher )Tj
T*(explained, "[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic )Tj
T*(fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life )Tj
T*(as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of )Tj
T*(what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now."[3] While studio )Tj
T*(executives worried that Fight Club was going to be "sinister and seditious", )Tj
T*(Fincher sought to make it "funny and seditious" by including humor to temper )Tj
T*(the sinister element.[6] )Tj
T*( Uhls described the film as a "romantic comedy", explaining, "It has to do with )Tj
T*(the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of )Tj
T*(behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work )Tj
T*(for them‚Äîbecause both characters are out on the edge psychologically."[7] The )Tj
T*(narrator seeks intimacy, but he avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of )Tj
T*(himself in her.[8] While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the )Tj
T*(narrator, he instead embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with )Tj
T*(befriending Tyler Durden. The narrator is comfortable being personally )Tj
T*(connected to Tyler Durden, but he becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually )Tj
T*(involved with Marla. When the narrator argues with Tyler about their )Tj
T*(friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the )Tj
T*(philosophy they have been exploring.[9] Tyler also suggests doing something )Tj
T*(about Marla, implying that she is a risk to be removed. When Tyler says this, )Tj
T*(the narrator realizes that his desires should have been focused on Marla and )Tj
T*(begins to diverge from Tyler's path.[8] )Tj

T*(Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing;[14] he orders )Tj
T*(around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors )Tj
T*(at Chinese re-education camps.[8] The narrator pulls back from Tyler and in the )Tj
T*(end, he arrives at a middle ground between his two conflicting selves.[9] )Tj
T*( Edward Norton said, "I feel that Fight Club really, in a way¬†... probed into )Tj
T*(the despair and paralysis that people feel in the face of having inherited this )Tj
T*(value system out of advertising."[13] Brad Pitt said, "Fight Club is a metaphor )Tj
T*(for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for )Tj
T*(it, so for the first time we can experience the pain."[15]Fight Club also )Tj
T*(parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of )Tj
T*(the people that live in the system.[13] The characters, having undergone )Tj
T*(societal emasculation, are reduced to "a generation of spectators".[16] A )Tj
T*(culture of advertising defines society's "external signifiers of happiness", )Tj
T*(causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more )Tj
T*(essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Calvin Klein, )Tj
T*(IKEA, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, "We smash it¬†)Tj
T*(... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation )Tj
T*(marketing plan that sold culture back to us."[17] His character also walks )Tj
T*(through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. )Tj
T*(Fincher described the narrator's immersion, "It was just the idea of living in )Tj
T*(this fraudulent idea of happiness." Pitt explained the dissonance, "I think )Tj
T*(there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real )Tj
T*(honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball )Tj
T*(teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure )Tj
T*(and success‚Äîlike these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the )Tj
T*(end."[15] )Tj
T*( The violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify physical )Tj
T*(combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are )Tj
T*(otherwise numb.[19] The fights tangibly represent a resistance to the impulse )Tj
T*(to be "cocooned" in society.[16] Norton believed that the fighting between the )Tj
T*(men strips away the "fear of pain" and "the reliance on material signifiers of )Tj
T*(their self-worth", leaving them to experience something valuable.[13] When the )Tj
T*(fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the )Tj
T*(revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the narrator pulls back and rejects )Tj
T*(Durden's ideas.[9]Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message, the )Tj
T*(interpretation of which is left to the audience.[14] Fincher elaborated, "I )Tj
T*(love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or )Tj
T*(solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be )Tj
T*(going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of )Tj
T*(solution."[6] )Tj

T*( The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was published in 1996. Before its )Tj
T*(publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to )Tj
T*(creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive tasked a studio reader to )Tj
T*(review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader )Tj
T*(discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender )Tj
T*(and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw )Tj
T*(potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with )Tj
T*(actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six )Tj
T*(hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used )Tj
T*(the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura )Tj
T*(Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to the tape and purchased )Tj
T*(the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.[20] )Tj
T*( Ziskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry to write the adaptation, finding )Tj
T*(Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When )Tj

T*(believed Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star. )Tj
T*(The studio signed Pitt and offered him a $17.5¬†million salary.[22] )Tj

T*(studio's future films for a smaller salary \(Norton satisfied the obligation )Tj
T*(with his role in the 2003 film The Italian Job\).[22] )Tj
T*( In January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton )Tj
T*(were cast in the film.[24] The actors prepared for their roles by taking )Tj
T*(lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling,[25] and soapmaking.[26] Pitt )Tj
T*(voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so )Tj
T*(his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after )Tj

T*( Fincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who )Tj
T*(objected to the film's sexual content.[28] The filmmakers considered Courtney )Tj

T*(1997 film The Wings of the Dove.[30] )Tj

T*( [edit] Writing )Tj
T*( Screenwriter Jim Uhls started working on an early draft of the adapted )Tj
T*(screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived at the )Tj
T*(time that the technique was "hackneyed and trite". When Fincher joined the )Tj
T*(film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the )Tj
T*(film's humor came from the narrator's voice.[22] The director described the )Tj
T*(film without a voice-over as seemingly "sad and pathetic".[31] Fincher and Uhls )Tj
T*(revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that )Tj
T*(reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he )Tj
T*(was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. )Tj
T*(Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested )Tj
T*(giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew )Tj
T*(Kevin Walker for assistance. The director invited Pitt and Norton to help )Tj
T*(revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a )Tj
T*(year.[22] )Tj
T*( Chuck Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and )Tj
T*(applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk )Tj
T*(recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist )Tj
T*(from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, "If they accept )Tj
T*(everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in )Tj
T*(the theater, they'll stay with it."[32] Palahniuk's novel also contained )Tj
T*(homoerotic overtones, which the director included in the film to make audiences )Tj
T*(uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the film's twists.[1] The bathroom )Tj
T*(scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the narrator is an example of the )Tj
T*(overtones; the line, "I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we )Tj
T*(need," was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than )Tj
T*(homosexuality.[8] Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in )Tj
T*(which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the narrator's mouth.[33] )Tj
T*( The narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler )Tj
T*(Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the )Tj
T*(narrator is placed in a mental institution.[6] Norton drew parallels between )Tj
T*(redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the )Tj
T*(protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of )Tj
T*(self.[9] Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and )Tj
T*(changed the ending to move away from him: "I wanted people to love Tyler, but I )Tj
T*(also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing."[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Filming )Tj
T*( Studio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of $23¬†million )Tj
T*(to finance the film,[20] but by the start of production, the budget was )Tj
T*(increased to $50¬†million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the )Tj
T*(projected budget escalated to $67¬†million. New Regency's head and Fight Club )Tj
T*(executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least )Tj
T*($5¬†million. The director refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New )Tj
T*(Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support )Tj
T*(by sending him tapes of dailies from Fight Club. After seeing three weeks of )Tj
T*(filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing.[34] The final )Tj
T*(production budget was $63¬†million.[35] )Tj
T*( The fight scenes were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to )Tj
T*("go full out" to capture realistic effects like having the wind knocked out of )Tj
T*(them.[15] Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who worked for the director on the 1997 )Tj
T*(film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray )Tj
T*(the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, )Tj
T*(citing as inspiration the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of )Tj
T*(Evander Holyfield's ear.[36] Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat )Tj
T*(on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the )Tj
T*(unadulterated water for "wet sweat". Meat Loaf, who plays a member of the fight )Tj
T*(club who has "bitch tits", wore a 90-pound \(40¬†kg\) fat harness that gave him )Tj
T*(large breasts for the role.[25] He also wore eight-inch \(20¬†cm\) lifts in his )Tj
T*(scenes with Norton to be taller than him.[8] )Tj
T*( Filming lasted 138 days,[37] during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls )Tj

T*(of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film.[25] The locations were )Tj
T*(in and around Los Angeles and on sets built at the studio in Century City.[37] )Tj
T*(Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets.[25] The )Tj
T*(exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in San Pedro, California, while the )Tj
T*(interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was )Tj
T*(given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the )Tj
T*(characters.[37] Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of the )Tj
T*(Rosalind Apartments in downtown LA. Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 )Tj
T*(locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his )Tj
T*(succeeding and less complex film Panic Room, "I felt like I was spending all my )Tj
T*(time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of )Tj
T*(dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on."[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cinematography )Tj
T*( Fincher used the Super 35 format to film Fight Club since it gave him maximum )Tj
T*(flexibility in composing shots. He hired Jeff Cronenweth as cinematographer; )Tj
T*(Cronenweth's father Jordan Cronenweth was the cinematographer who worked for )Tj
T*(Fincher on the 1992 film Alien 3 but left midway through its production due to )Tj
T*(Parkinson's disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films Seven )Tj
T*(and The Game, and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for Fight )Tj
T*(Club.[37] )Tj
T*( They applied a lurid style, choosing to make people "sort of shiny". The )Tj
T*(appearance of the narrator's scenes without Tyler Durden were bland and )Tj
T*(realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as "more hyper-real )Tj
T*(in a torn-down, deconstructed sense‚Äîa visual metaphor of what [the narrator is] )Tj
T*(heading into". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, )Tj
T*(makeup, and art direction.[37] Helena Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to )Tj
T*(portray her romantic nihilistic character with a "smack-fiend patina". Fincher )Tj
T*(and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film American Graffiti, which )Tj
T*(applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a )Tj
T*(variety of colors. )Tj
T*( The crew took advantage of both natural and practical light at filming )Tj
T*(locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for )Tj
T*(example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the )Tj
T*(shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other )Tj
T*(practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the )Tj
T*(prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.[37] On the other hand, Fincher )Tj
T*(also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were )Tj
T*(less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis's technique as the )Tj
T*(influence.[8] )Tj
T*( Fight Club was filmed mostly at night and Fincher purposely filmed the daytime )Tj
T*(shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with )Tj
T*(inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish )Tj
T*(camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed )Tj
T*(the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera )Tj
T*(from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.[37] )Tj
T*( The scenes with Tyler Durden were staged to conceal that the character was a )Tj
T*(mental projection of the unnamed narrator. The character was not filmed in two )Tj
T*(shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over the shoulder shots )Tj
T*(in scenes where Tyler gives the narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In )Tj
T*(scenes before the narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's )Tj
T*(presence in single frames for subliminal effect. Tyler appears in the )Tj
T*(background and out of focus, like a "little devil on the shoulder".[8] Fincher )Tj
T*(explained the subliminal frames: "Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own )Tj
T*(mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the narrator's )Tj
T*(consciousness."[39] )Tj
T*( While Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak film stock normally on )Tj
T*(Fight Club, several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. )Tj
T*(Flashing was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the )Tj
T*(contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be )Tj
T*(underexposed, Technicolor's ENR silver retention was used on a select number of )Tj

T*( [edit] Visual effects )Tj
T*( Fincher hired visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on )Tj
T*(The Game, to create visual effects for Fight Club. Haug assigned the visual )Tj
T*(effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed )Tj
T*(different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and )Tj
T*(scanning. Haug explained, "We selected the best people for each aspect of the )Tj
T*(effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play )Tj
T*(to a facility's weakness." Fincher visualized the narrator's perspective )Tj
T*(through a "mind's eye" view and structured a myopic framework for the film )Tj
T*(audiences. Fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and )Tj
T*(visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during )Tj
T*(the actual filming.[39] )Tj
T*( The film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that )Tj
T*(depicts the inside of the narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera )Tj
T*(pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the )Tj
T*(thought processes initiated by his fear impulse. The sequence, designed in part )Tj
T*(by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the )Tj
T*(sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999.[39] Fincher hired Digital )Tj
T*(Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award )Tj
T*(for Visual Effects for the 1998 film What Dreams May Come, for the sequence. )Tj
T*(The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system,[41] and the )Tj
T*(design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. )Tj
T*(The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull )Tj
T*(included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the )Tj
T*(artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, "While he wanted to keep the )Tj
T*(brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be )Tj
T*(coupled with the feel of a night dive‚Äîwet, scary, and with a low depth of )Tj
T*(field." The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing )Tj
T*(process.[39] )Tj
T*( Other visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past )Tj
T*(city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in )Tj
T*(underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of )Tj
T*(nearly 100¬†photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael )Tj
T*(Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office )Tj
T*(buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the )Tj
T*(scene for over fourteen¬†months.[39] )Tj
T*( Midway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the cue mark‚Äînicknamed )Tj
T*("cigarette burn" in the film‚Äîto the audience. The scene represents a turning )Tj
T*(point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the "fairly )Tj
T*(subjective reality" that existed earlier in the film. The director explained, )Tj
T*("Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers )Tj
T*(have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way."[39] )Tj
T*( [edit] Musical score )Tj
T*( Fincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing film scores would be )Tj
T*(unable to tie the movie's themes together, so he sought a band which had never )Tj
T*(recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead,[8] but ultimately chose the breakbeat )Tj
T*(producing duo Dust Brothers to score the film. The duo created a post-modern )Tj
T*(score that included drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. )Tj
T*(Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup: "Fincher wanted to )Tj
T*(break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score )Tj
T*(helped achieve that."[42] The end credits feature the song "Where Is My Mind?" )Tj

T*(an audience for the film.[44] Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the )Tj
T*(film, recalled the response: "So many incidences of Fight Club were alarming, )Tj
T*(no group of executives could narrow them down."[45] Nevertheless, Fight Club )Tj
T*(was originally slated to be released in July 1999[46] but was later changed to )Tj
T*(August¬†6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to )Tj
T*(autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production )Tj
T*(process.[47] Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School )Tj
T*(massacre earlier in the year.[48] )Tj
T*( Marketing executives at 20th Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing Fight )Tj
T*(Club and at one point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered )Tj
T*(that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its )Tj
T*(violence and believed that not even Brad Pitt would attract female filmgoers. )Tj
T*(Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to )Tj
T*(let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire )Tj
T*(the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm )Tj
T*(proposed a bar of pink soap with the title "Fight Club" embossed on it as the )Tj
T*(film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered "a bad joke" by Fox )Tj
T*(executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public )Tj
T*(service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think )Tj
T*(the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a )Tj
T*($20¬†million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, )Tj
T*(billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The )Tj
T*(studio advertised Fight Club on cable during World Wrestling Federation )Tj
T*(broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the )Tj
T*(wrong context for the film.[44] Linson believed that the "ill-conceived )Tj
T*(one-dimensional" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely )Tj
T*(contributed to Fight Club's lukewarm box office performance in the United )Tj
T*(States.[49] )Tj
T*( [edit] Theatrical run )Tj
T*( The studio held Fight Club's world premiere at the 56th Venice International )Tj
T*(Film Festival in September 1999.[50] For the American theatrical release, the )Tj
T*(studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group )Tj
T*(predicted the film would gross between $13¬†million and $15¬†million in its )Tj
T*(opening weekend.[51]Fight Club opened commercially in the United States and )Tj
T*(Canada on October¬†15, 1999 and earned $11,035,485 in 1,963 theaters over the )Tj
T*(opening weekend.[35] The film ranked first at the weekend box office, defeating )Tj
T*(Double Jeopardy and The Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener.[52] The gender )Tj
T*(mix of audiences for Fight Club, argued to be "the ultimate anti-date flick", )Tj
T*(was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite )Tj
T*(the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's )Tj
T*(expectations.[53] Over the second weekend, Fight Club dropped 42.6% in revenue, )Tj
T*(earning $6,335,870.[54] The film, whose production budget was $63 million, )Tj
T*(grossed $37 million from its theatrical run in the United States and Canada and )Tj
T*(earned $100.9 million in theaters worldwide.[35] The underwhelming North )Tj
T*(American performance of Fight Club soured the relationship between 20th Century )Tj
T*(Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which )Tj
T*(contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000.[55] )Tj
T*( The British Board of Film Classification reviewed Fight Club for its November¬†)Tj
T*(12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving "an )Tj
T*(indulgence in the excitement of beating a \(defenseless\) man's face into a )Tj
T*(pulp". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to )Tj
T*(adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, )Tj
T*(considering and dismissing claims that Fight Club contained "dangerously )Tj
T*(instructive information" and could "encourage anti-social \(behavior\)". The )Tj
T*(board decided, "The film as a whole is‚Äîquite clearly‚Äîcritical and sharply )Tj
T*(parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of )Tj

T*( [edit] Home media )Tj
T*( Fincher supervised the composition of the DVD packaging and was one of the )Tj
T*(first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film )Tj
T*(was released in two DVD editions.[58] The single-disc edition included a )Tj
T*(commentary track,[59] while the two-disc special edition included the )Tj
T*(commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake )Tj
T*(public service announcements, the promotional music video "This is Your Life", )Tj
T*(Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity )Tj
T*(materials.[60] The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for )Tj
T*(the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative )Tj
T*(development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: "The )Tj
T*(film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect )Tj
T*(an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, )Tj
T*(the more you'll get out of it." The studio developed the packaging for two )Tj
T*(months.[61] The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in )Tj
T*(brown cardboard wrapper. The title "Fight Club" was labeled diagonally across )Tj
T*(the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, "We wanted the )Tj
T*(package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between )Tj
T*(the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's )Tj
T*(inside."[61] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, )Tj
T*(described the design: "From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible )Tj
T*(shelf-presence."[62] )Tj
T*( Fight Club won the 2000 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Best DVD, Best )Tj
T*(DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features.[63]Entertainment Weekly ranked )Tj
T*(the film's two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of "The 50 )Tj
T*(Essential DVDs", giving top ratings to the DVD's content and technical )Tj
T*(picture-and-audio quality.[64] When the two-disc edition went out of print, the )Tj
T*(studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans' requests.[65] The DVD was one of )Tj
T*(the largest-selling in the studio's history;[49] it also grossed $55 million in )Tj
T*(video and DVD rentals.[66] With a weak box office performance in the United )Tj
T*(States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly )Tj
T*(successful DVD release, Fight Club generated a $10¬†million profit for the )Tj
T*(studio.[49] )Tj
T*( Fight Club was released in the Blu-ray Disc format in the United States on )Tj
T*(November¬†17, 2009.[67] Fox Creative chose Neuron Syndicate to design the art )Tj
T*(for the format's packaging, and Neuron commissioned five graffiti artists to )Tj
T*(create 30 pieces of art. The art encompasses urban aesthetics found on the East )Tj
T*(Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European )Tj
T*(street art.[68] The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic )Tj
T*(comedy Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the actual )Tj
T*(Fight Club menu screen. David Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include )Tj
T*(the fake menu screen.[69] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical reception )Tj
T*( When Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the )Tj
T*(film was debated fiercely by critics. A newspaper reported, "Many loved and )Tj
T*(hated it in equal measures." Some critics expressed concern that the film would )Tj
T*(incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in )Tj
T*(Britain nearly three decades previously.[70] Upon the film's theatrical )Tj
T*(release, The Times reported the reaction: "It touched a nerve in the male )Tj
T*(psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world."[71] Although the )Tj
T*(film's makers called Fight Club "an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s", )Tj
T*(some critics called it "irresponsible and appalling". Another newspaper )Tj
T*(charged, "Fight Club is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream )Tj
T*(Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork )Tj
T*(Orange."[72] )Tj
T*( Janet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, praised Fincher's direction )Tj
T*(and editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried a message of )Tj
T*("contemporary manhood", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be )Tj
T*(misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism.[73]Roger Ebert, )Tj
T*(reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, called Fight Club "visceral and )Tj

T*(hard-edged", and "a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy" that most audiences )Tj
T*(would not appreciate.[74] Ebert later acknowledged that the film was "beloved )Tj
T*(by most, not by me".[75] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film )Tj
T*(began with an "invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz", but that it )Tj
T*(eventually became "explosively silly".[76]Newsweek's David Ansen described )Tj
T*(Fight Club as "an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile )Tj
T*(philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload" and thought that the )Tj
T*(ending was too pretentious.[77] Richard Schickel of Time described the )Tj
T*(director's mise en sc√®ne as dark and damp: "It enforces the contrast between )Tj
T*(the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. )Tj
T*(Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's )Tj
T*(carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point )Tj
T*(simply: it's better to be wet than dry." Schickel applauded the performances of )Tj
T*(Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film's "conventionally )Tj
T*(gimmicky" unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter's character )Tj
T*(interesting.[78] )Tj
T*( Cineaste's Gary Crowdus reviewed the critical reception in retrospect: "Many )Tj
T*(critics praised Fight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, )Tj
T*(and thought-provoking films of the year." He wrote of the negative opinion, )Tj
T*("While Fight Club had numerous critical champions, the film's critical )Tj
T*(attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about )Tj

T*( [edit] Accolades )Tj
T*( Fight Club was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, )Tj
T*(but it lost to The Matrix.[80] Helena Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award )Tj
T*(for Best British Actress.[81] The Online Film Critics Society also nominated )Tj
T*(Fight Club for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor \(Edward Norton\), Best )Tj
T*(Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay \(Jim Uhls\).[82] Though the film won none )Tj
T*(of the awards, the organization listed Fight Club as one of the top ten films )Tj
T*(of 1999.[83] The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to Notting )Tj
T*(Hill.[84] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cultural impact )Tj
T*( Fight Club was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the )Tj
T*(1990s.[15][85] Like other 1999 films Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, and Three )Tj
T*(Kings, Fight Club was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style )Tj
T*(since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology.[86] After Fight )Tj
T*(Club's theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth,[87] and )Tj
T*(the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David )Tj
T*(Ansen of Newsweek conjectured would enjoy "perennial" fame.[88][89] The film's )Tj
T*(success also heightened the profile of the novel's author, Chuck Palahniuk, to )Tj
T*(global renown.[90] )Tj
T*( Following Fight Club's release, several fight clubs were reported to have )Tj
T*(started in the United States. A "Gentleman's Fight Club" was started in Menlo )Tj
T*(Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the high tech )Tj
T*(industry.[91] Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and )Tj
T*(Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, )Tj
T*(leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant )Tj
T*(from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and )Tj
T*(the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.[92] An )Tj
T*(unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches )Tj
T*(were held on campus.[93] The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a )Tj
T*(college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was )Tj
T*(to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the )Tj
T*(scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its )Tj
T*(exterior.[94] On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club )Tj
T*(in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks )Tj

T*( [edit] Tropical Storm Agatha )Tj
T*( A poorly defined tropical wave crossed Central America into the eastern )Tj
T*(Pacific Ocean on June 8. As it tracked westward under the influence of a ridge )Tj
T*(to its north, a broad circulation developed. Gradually, the dominant center of )Tj
T*(circulation became better defined, with increasingly organized convection and )Tj
T*(developing banding features.[1] By early on June 11, the center became )Tj
T*(sufficiently associated with the convection for the National Hurricane Center )Tj
T*(\(NHC\) to classify the system as Tropical Depression One-E. This occurred while )Tj
T*(the area of unsettled weather was about 460¬†miles \(765¬†km\) south-southwest of )Tj
T*(Acapulco, Mexico.[4] )Tj
T*( The center of the depression was not initially well defined, with restricted )Tj
T*(outflow in the eastern half of the circulation.[4] As such, the depression )Tj
T*(failed to attain any significant organization in the days subsequent to its )Tj
T*(formation. Later, an approaching tropical wave merged with the depression, )Tj
T*(resulting in a trend of intensification and increased organization. By June 13, )Tj
T*(the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, and gave it the name )Tj
T*("Agatha". Agatha was about 650¬†miles \(1050¬†km\) south-southeast of Cabo San )Tj
T*(Lucas when it became a tropical storm.[1] As Agatha became a tropical storm, )Tj
T*(forecasters predicted that it would not strengthen further, due to its forecast )Tj
T*(track passing over cooler waters.[5] However, Agatha quickly strengthened, )Tj
T*(developing a curved band of convection wrapping around its center,[6] and early )Tj
T*(on June 11 it attained a peak intensity of 65¬†mph \(100¬†km/h\) while about 615¬†)Tj
T*(miles \(985¬†km\) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Agatha )Tj
T*(maintained peak winds for about 12¬†hours before moving over colder waters and )Tj
T*(gradually weakening. On June 15, it degenerated back into a tropical )Tj
T*(depression, and a day later, it dissipated over the open waters of the Pacific )Tj
T*(Ocean. The storm never affected land.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Tropical Depression Two-E )Tj
T*( A few days later, another westward-moving tropical disturbance paralleled the )Tj
T*(southern coast of Central America and Mexico. Convection in the area organized )Tj
T*(steadily, and late on June 19, the system developed into Tropical Depression )Tj
T*(Two-E about 260¬†miles \(420¬†km\) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. On )Tj
T*(becoming a tropical depression, the system maintained a large, elongated, )Tj
T*(low-level circulation with some banding features and restricted outflow due to )Tj
T*(wind shear. The National Hurricane Center first predicted that the depression )Tj
T*(would intensify, reaching winds of 50¬†mph \(80¬†km/h\), though two computer models )Tj
T*(projected it to quickly dissipate. Under the influence of a ridge over Mexico, )Tj
T*(the depression moved to the west-northwest,[7] and, under the influence of )Tj
T*(increasing wind shear, the depression failed to organize significantly. By June )Tj
T*(20, the circulation center was partially exposed, and was located to the )Tj
T*(northeast of the primary convection¬†‚Äì traits that signal a weak storm. Two-E )Tj
T*(approached tropical storm status,[8] though deep convection waned after the )Tj
T*(system moved over cooler waters. On June 21, the National Hurricane Center )Tj
T*(issued the last advisory on the depression, stating that the depression )Tj
T*(maintained a very well-defined, low-level circulation, but had no convection )Tj
T*(associated with the system.[9] Locally heavy rains fell across southwest Mexico )Tj
T*(in association with this system, peaking at 5.55 inches \(141¬†mm\) at Las )Tj
T*(Gaviotas/Compostela.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Hurricane Blas )Tj
T*( On June 8, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. The wave remained )Tj
T*(weak and nondescript as it crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern )Tj
T*(Pacific Ocean on June 19. An area of convection developed and organized along )Tj
T*(the wave's axis, and the National Hurricane Center began to employ Dvorak )Tj

T*(well to the south of Hawaii on July 5 before dissipating. The Associated Press )Tj
T*(attributed 4¬†deaths from a mudslide in Michoac√°n to Blas. However, as the )Tj

T*( [edit] Tropical Storm Celia )Tj
T*( On July 1, another tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. It moved )Tj
T*(westward due to strong wind shear without further organization, and crossed )Tj
T*(Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 11. An area of )Tj
T*(organizing convection developed along the wave axis, and Dvorak classifications )Tj
T*(began on July 13, while the tropical wave was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. )Tj
T*(The cloud pattern soon became disorganized, and the area of disturbed weather )Tj
T*(continued west-northwestward. On July 16, convection increased and organized )Tj
T*(into banding features; early on July 17, the system developed into Tropical )Tj
T*(Depression Four-E about 150¬†miles \(240¬†km\) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Soon )Tj
T*(after becoming a tropical depression, the storm rapidly organized and )Tj
T*(intensified into Tropical Storm Celia six hours after becoming a tropical )Tj
T*(depression. The tropical storm initially moved northwestward, and briefly )Tj
T*(threatened southern Baja California. As a result, the government of Mexico )Tj
T*(issued a tropical storm warning on July 18 for La Paz southward. Shortly )Tj
T*(thereafter, a mid- to upper-level anticyclone turned Celia to the )Tj
T*(west-northwest and forced it to pass about 150¬†miles \(240¬†km\) south-southwest )Tj
T*(of Cabo San Lucas. On July 19, Celia attained maximum sustained winds of 60¬†mph )Tj
T*(\(95¬†km/h\) before moving over cooler waters and diminishing in convection. The )Tj
T*(storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 20, and Celia dissipated )Tj
T*(early on July 21, well away from the Mexican coastline.[13] )Tj
T*( The precursor tropical disturbance produced locally heavy rainfall along the )Tj
T*(south coast of Mexico.[13] Authorities in Mexico closed the port at Acapulco to )Tj
T*(small fishing and recreational boats, and advised larger craft to use )Tj
T*(caution.[14] Damage from the storm, if any, is unknown. )Tj
T*( [edit] Hurricane Darby )Tj
T*( A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 4. It tracked westward )Tj
T*(across the Atlantic Ocean with little increase in convection, and crossed )Tj
T*(Central America into the Pacific Ocean on July 16. Three days later, convection )Tj
T*(began to increase along the wave axis while the wave was well to the south of )Tj
T*(Acapulco, Mexico. On July 21, Dvorak classifications began as the cloud pattern )Tj
T*(displayed curvature on satellite images. Convective banding features gradually )Tj

T*(Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression continued to organize, with increasing )Tj
T*(convection and distinct upper-level outflow, and early on July 30 the )Tj
T*(depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle.[18] )Tj
T*( Tropical Storm Estelle gradually intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, )Tj

T*(attained hurricane status about 550¬†miles \(885¬†km\) south-southeast of the )Tj
T*(southern tip of Baja California. Its intensification continued as a )Tj
T*(well-defined eye about 30¬†miles \(48¬†km\) in diameter became visible on satellite )Tj
T*(imagery, and on August 2 Estelle reached its peak intensity of 135¬†mph \(215¬†)Tj
T*(km/h\). The hurricane soon began to weaken as deep convection diminished and the )Tj
T*(eye disappeared on satellite imagery. Two days after peaking in intensity, )Tj
T*(Estelle weakened to tropical storm status. Late on August 4, the convection )Tj
T*(associated with the storm dissipated, and the next day the storm weakened to )Tj
T*(tropical depression status. Convection briefly re-developed on August 6, though )Tj
T*(increased wind shear and cooler water weakened the depression further. Two days )Tj
T*(later, Estelle dissipated about 400¬†miles \(645¬†km\) east-northeast of the )Tj
T*(Hawaiian Islands.[18] High surf from Estelle impacted southern California, )Tj
T*(resulting in a number of lifeguard rescues.[19] The storm disrupted the trade )Tj

T*(Oahu.[20] )Tj
T*( [edit] Tropical Storm Frank )Tj
T*( On July 19, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. A mid-level )Tj
T*(circulation developed to the south of Cape Verde on July 22, though the wave )Tj
T*(became less distinct as it continued westward. The wave axis crossed Central )Tj
T*(America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 31. Convection steadily )Tj
T*(increased, though it was not until August 4 that the convection began to )Tj
T*(organize. Dvorak classifications began on August 4, and subsequent to the )Tj
T*(formation of a low-level circulation the system developed into Tropical )Tj
T*(Depression Seven-E on August 6 about 550¬†miles \(885¬†km\) south of the southern )Tj
T*(tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression tracked generally )Tj
T*(northward, under the influence of a ridge over Mexico and a mid-level trough to )Tj

T*( [edit] Hurricane Georgette )Tj
T*( A tropical wave was first observed in the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 4 in )Tj
T*(association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. It tracked westward, and )Tj
T*(by August 9 a low-level circulation formed well to the south of Mexico. Banding )Tj
T*(features increased as the system detached from the Intertropical Convergence )Tj
T*(Zone, and on August 11, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight-E )Tj
T*(about 730¬†miles \(1170¬†km\) southwest of Acapulco.[28] On becoming a tropical )Tj
T*(cyclone, the depression maintained an area of concentrated deep convection near )Tj
T*(the center. The National Hurricane Center initially predicted that the )Tj
T*(depression would slowly intensify and reach winds of 70¬†mph \(115¬†km/h\) within )Tj
T*(72¬†hours. For much of the rest of the storm's duration, the National Hurricane )Tj
T*(Center underestimated the intensity of the cyclone.[29] )Tj
T*( The depression tracked steadily northwestward, caused by its location along )Tj
T*(the western periphery of a subtropical ridge. It would retain that direction )Tj
T*(for most of its remaining duration. Late on August 11, it intensified into )Tj
T*(Tropical Storm Georgette, and two days later it attained hurricane status after )Tj

T*(km/h\) while centered 690¬†miles \(1110¬†km\) west-southwest of the southern tip of )Tj
T*(Baja California.[28] The hurricane soon moved over cooler water,[30] and began )Tj

T*( Javier is believed to have originated from a tropical wave that moved off the )Tj
T*(coast of Africa on August 22. A convective disturbance along the northern )Tj
T*(portion of the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Danielle on August 24, )Tj
T*(while the southern portion of the wave axis continued westward. The wave )Tj
T*(remained inactive and difficult to track as it crossed the Atlantic. On )Tj
T*(September 3, an area of convection began to develop near Acapulco, at the same )Tj
T*(time and location where the wave would have been based on extrapolation. The )Tj
T*(disturbance became better defined on September 5 as it tracked )Tj
T*(west-northwestward, and on September 6 the convection became sufficiently )Tj
T*(organized and persistent for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as )Tj
T*(Tropical Depression Eleven-E, while it was located about 200¬†miles \(330¬†km\) )Tj
T*(southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[36] )Tj
T*( Easterly wind shear initially dislocated the circulation center to the eastern )Tj
T*(edge of the convection. The subtropical ridge to its north resulted in a )Tj
T*(general west-northwest motion,[37] and the depression slowly intensified into )Tj
T*(Tropical Storm Javier late on September 7. Banding features in the system did )Tj
T*(not organize significantly, and on September 8, Javier attained a peak )Tj
T*(intensity of 60¬†mph \(95¬†km/h\), which coincided with a sharp increase in )Tj
T*(convection over the center. Steering currents soon weakened, and the storm )Tj
T*(turned to the east while convection quickly decreased. By September 9, the )Tj
T*(center was exposed from the diminishing deep convection, and that night it )Tj
T*(degenerated into a tropical depression. On September 11, the National Hurricane )Tj
T*(Center issued its final advisory on Javier, though later analysis indicates )Tj
T*(that it remained a tropical cyclone as it turned southeastward. At times, it )Tj
T*(became difficult to distinguish Javier from the broader area of disturbed )Tj
T*(weather that persisted over the tropical eastern Pacific, though a brief )Tj
T*(increase in convection and a ship report of winds exceeding 40¬†mph \(65¬†km/h\) )Tj
T*(indicate that Javier strengthened again into a tropical storm late on September )Tj

T*( [edit] Tropical Depression Twelve-E )Tj
T*( A tropical disturbance developed persistent convection in association with a )Tj

T*(October 1 about 350¬†miles \(565¬†km\) west-northwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Within )Tj
T*(an environment of weak steering currents, the depression was initially forecast )Tj
T*(to track slowly west-northwestward and reach winds of 60¬†mph \(95¬†km/h\), but )Tj
T*(instead it drifted eastward before turning slowly to the west.[40][41] The )Tj
T*(depression failed to organize and gradually worsened in appearance. Early on )Tj
T*(October 2, two ships reported southwest winds much further to the north, with )Tj
T*(the National Hurricane Center indicating that either the center was exceedingly )Tj
T*(small, that no center existed at the time, or that the center was located far )Tj
T*(to the north of the thunderstorm activity. Operationally, the center was )Tj
T*(relocated further to the north,[42] then relocated about 115 miles \(185¬†km\) to )Tj
T*(the south six hours later based on visible satellite images,[43] then again )Tj
T*(relocated to the north, coinciding with officials issuing the last advisory on )Tj
T*(the system. By early October 3, the depression possessed only intermittent )Tj
T*(convection,[44] and later that day it dissipated to the southwest of the Baja )Tj
T*(California peninsula.[41] Heavy rains from its eastern periphery fell across )Tj
T*(southwest Mexico, with a maximum total of 6.34 inches \(161¬†mm\) at Las )Tj

T*( [edit] Hurricane Kay )Tj
T*( A small, low-level circulation separated itself from the Intertropical )Tj
T*(Convergence Zone on October 10, several hundred miles southwest of Baja )Tj

T*(initially minimal and disorganized. On October 12, the convection increased )Tj
T*(greatly, and the system was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical )Tj
T*(Depression Thirteen-E early on October 13, about 715¬†miles \(1150¬†km\) southwest )Tj
T*(of Cabo San Lucas. Dvorak classifications also indicated winds of about 35¬†mph )Tj
T*(\(55¬†km/h\). Operationally, the depression was forecast to intensify to reach )Tj
T*(peak winds of 45¬†mph \(70¬†km/h\) while tracking steadily west-northwestward.[46] )Tj
T*( The storm center was at first ill-defined,[47] and post-season analysis )Tj
T*(estimates that it intensified into Tropical Storm Kay about 6¬†hours after )Tj
T*(developing. After becoming a tropical storm, Kay rapidly organized as it )Tj
T*(tracked generally westward. A pinhole eye developed in the center of the )Tj
T*(convection, and Kay attained hurricane status late on October 13, about 18¬†)Tj
T*(hours after developing. After remaining a hurricane for about 12¬†hours, the eye )Tj
T*(disappeared and the convection weakened, and early on October 14 Kay )Tj
T*(degenerated into a tropical storm. Within an environment of weak steering )Tj
T*(currents, the storm turned to the southwest, then to the south, after weakening )Tj
T*(to a tropical depression on October 15. Convection sporadically redeveloped, )Tj

T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon \(Amazona vittata\), also known as the Puerto Rican )Tj
T*(Parrot or Iguaca, is the only bird endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico )Tj
T*(belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona. Measuring 28‚Äì30¬†cm \(11.0‚Äì11.8¬†in\), )Tj
T*(the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings )Tj
T*(around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts )Tj
T*(regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, )Tj
T*(extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban Amazon )Tj
T*(\(Amazona leucocephala\) and the Hispaniolan Amazon \(Amazona ventralis\). )Tj
T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon reaches sexual maturity between three and four years )Tj
T*(of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays )Tj
T*(eggs she will remain in the nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. )Tj
T*(The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after )Tj
T*(hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, )Tj
T*(bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy. )Tj
T*( The species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been )Tj
T*(listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union since 1994. )Tj
T*(Once widespread and abundant, the population declined drastically in the 19th )Tj
T*(and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat; the )Tj
T*(species completely vanished from Vieques and Mona Island, nearby to the main )Tj
T*(island of Puerto Rico. Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird )Tj
T*(from extinction. In 2006, the total estimated population was 34 to 40 )Tj
T*(individuals in the wild and 143 individuals in captivity.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy and evolution )Tj
T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon was described by Dutch ornithologist Pieter Boddaert )Tj
T*(in 1783. It belongs to the large Neotropical genus Amazona, commonly known as )Tj
T*(amazons; these birds have also been given the generic epithet of 'parrot' by )Tj
T*(the American Ornithologists' Union, hence Puerto Rican Parrot is an alternative )Tj
T*(common name in North America.[3] The indigenous Ta√≠no people called it the )Tj

T*(Phylogeny of the Greater Antillean Amazona after Russello and Amato, 2004.)Tj
T*( There is no evidence that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the )Tj
T*(past, and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from )Tj
T*(those that immigrated to the Caribbean at some point. Some small species would )Tj
T*(have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water, but parrots have )Tj
T*(flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate )Tj
T*("over-water" dispersion.[6] Most Caribbean bird species originate from Central, )Tj
T*(North and South America.[7] The Amazona species found in the Caribbean are )Tj
T*(divided in two groups: five mid-sized species found in the Greater Antilles and )Tj
T*(seven large species in the Lesser Antilles.[8] All the Greater Antillean )Tj
T*(Amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness, )Tj
T*(including predominantly green-toned color patterns and white rings around the )Tj
T*(eyes.[8] Russello and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean Amazona descend )Tj
T*(from Amazona albifrons with Amazona vittata, Amazona leucocephala, and Amazona )Tj
T*(ventralis constituting a complex, a cluster of species so closely related that )Tj
T*(they intergrade.[9] )Tj
T*( British ornithologist David Lack considered that the Puerto Rican Amazon had )Tj
T*(evolved from the Hispaniolan Amazon \(A. ventralis\) found in Hispaniola, but it )Tj
T*(has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including )Tj
T*(the similarities found between the Black-billed Amazon \(A. agilis\) of Jamaica )Tj
T*(and the Puerto Rican Amazon.[10] Subsequent studies showed that size and color )Tj
T*(patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that )Tj
T*(patterns changed with relative ease even within members of the same )Tj
T*(species.[10] The research concluded that the Puerto Rican Amazon may share a )Tj
T*(common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis.[11] Recent phylogenetic studies )Tj
T*(show that the Puerto Rican Amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan )Tj
T*(Amazon and the Cuban Amazon than to the Black-billed Amazon.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon measures 28‚Äì30¬†cm \(11.0‚Äì11.8¬†in\) and weighs 250‚Äì300¬†g )Tj
T*(\(8.8‚Äì10.6¬†oz\), or 275¬†g \(9.7¬†oz\) on average. Although small compared to Amazons )Tj
T*(in general, it is similar in size to other Greater Antilles Amazona species. )Tj
T*(Sexual dimorphism is not present. Both males and females have predominantly )Tj
T*(green plumage, though their feathers have blue edges. The primary flight )Tj
T*(feathers of the wings and the main covert feathers are dark blue. The color of )Tj
T*(the feathers on the underside varies depending on the body part: the feathers )Tj
T*(on the underside of the wings, which can be seen during flight, are bright )Tj
T*(blue; those in the tail have yellow-green tone. Their underparts are paler and )Tj
T*(yellow-tinged, their foreheads are red, and they have white ovals around the )Tj
T*(eyes. The iris is brown, the bill a horn color, and the legs yellow-tan.[13] )Tj
T*(Aside from DNA tests, males and females can only be distinguished by behavioral )Tj
T*(differences during the breeding season. Immature birds have plumage similar to )Tj
T*(adults.[13]  )Tj
T*( [edit] Population and distribution )Tj

T*(Virgin Islands.[16][17] Estimates of the parrot's early numbers vary greatly. )Tj
T*(Some authorities claim that there were once more than a million )Tj
T*(individuals,[18] while others suggest a more modest population of 100,000. )Tj
T*(During the first 150 years of Spanish rule the human population was small, and )Tj
T*(in 1650, when the population of the island was 880 people, the species was )Tj
T*(still abundant throughout the archipelago.[19] After 1650, human habitation )Tj
T*(increased exponentially, and by the 18th century the Puerto Rican Amazon )Tj
T*(population started to be affected. Heinrich Moritz Gaede, a German naturalist, )Tj
T*(declared that by 1836 the parrot population had noticeably declined.[20] Even )Tj
T*(so, as late as 1864, British ornithologist Edward Cavendish Taylor noted that )Tj
T*(the parrots were still common near the island's capital, San Juan.[20] )Tj
T*( At first, human activity had not posed a significant threat to the Puerto )Tj
T*(Rican Amazon. The Ta√≠no hunted the parrot but without much effect on its )Tj
T*(population.[21] In the past two hundred years, however, many factors have led )Tj
T*(to a drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the )Tj
T*(construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young )Tj
T*(chicks as pets.[22] Especially during the latter half of the 19th century, most )Tj
T*(of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were )Tj
T*(cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, )Tj
T*(cotton, corn and rice. The Amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its )Tj
T*(main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted )Tj
T*(the bird if possible.[23] As agriculture expanded, the Amazon's habitat )Tj
T*(disappeared further and its population declined. )Tj
T*( The species was historically found in mature or old-growth forests in Puerto )Tj
T*(Rico at all elevations, and in holes, cliffs, and other diverse habitats at )Tj
T*(lower elevations. The species could be found at medium elevations in the )Tj
T*(Guajataca State Forest \(until 1910\) and the Rio Abajo State Forest \(until the )Tj
T*(1920s\), and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest \(until the )Tj
T*(1930s\).[24] Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away )Tj
T*(from the Luquillo forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island's )Tj
T*(coast to find food.[14] At the same time, the species was extirpated from )Tj
T*(Puerto Rico's smaller islands‚ÄîCulebra, Vieques and Mona‚Äîand became restricted )Tj
T*(to five locations: two in karst-limestone areas, two in high montane )Tj
T*(rainforests and one in mangrove forest at the foot of the El Yunque National )Tj
T*(Forest. One of these karst regions, located in the northwestern part of Puerto )Tj
T*(Rico, was identified as a haven for the species. In particular, a region named )Tj
T*(Valle de las Cotorras \(Valley of the Parrots\), located between San Sebasti√°n )Tj
T*(and Morovis, was home to a sizable population. Some Amazons survived in small )Tj
T*(pockets of degraded forest but these proved insufficient to support large )Tj
T*(colonies. Eventually their natural habitat was reduced to the Cordillera )Tj
T*(Central and undisturbed forest areas, and by 1940 they were only to be found in )Tj
T*(primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest. The )Tj
T*(species is currently found at elevations between 396 and 823 m \(1,299 and 2,700 )Tj
T*(ft\). Since the species requires mature forests with open-cavity trees for )Tj
T*(reproduction, it does not occur in dwarf and secondary forests. )Tj
T*( By the 1950s, there were only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the )Tj
T*(population reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, )Tj
T*(and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on )Tj
T*(September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico )Tj
T*(inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In the aftermath of the )Tj
T*(hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild )Tj
T*(population was 30‚Äì35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable )Tj
T*(albeit with some fluctuations.[2][25] The current range of the species is 16¬†)Tj
T*(km2 \(6.2¬†sq¬†mi\), 0.2% of what it once was.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Behavior )Tj
T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon is diurnal, typically beginning its day half an hour )Tj
T*(after sunrise.[26] It is generally secretive when inside its nest, using its )Tj
T*(green plumage as camouflage. In contrast, it may be vocal and noisy when )Tj
T*(outside the nest. Upon taking flight, its color pattern provides some contrast )Tj
T*(to the forest. The flight mechanism of this species is similar to the one found )Tj

T*(reaching a top speed of approximately 30¬†km/h \(19¬†mph\), and are fairly agile )Tj
T*(when evading predators in mid-air.[27] When in search of food, the parrots )Tj
T*(group in pairs. Couples and their fledged young display a tendency to stay )Tj
T*(together.[28] The Amazon makes two flight calls, a take-off squawk which )Tj
T*(consist of a pattern of long squawks, and a loud "bugle", commonly used in )Tj
T*(flight and which may have several meanings depending on the circumstances when )Tj
T*(it is used.[29] )Tj
T*( Like almost all Amazons, the Puerto Rican Amazon is a herbivore. Its diet )Tj
T*(consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest's )Tj
T*(canopy. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different )Tj
T*(materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger )Tj
T*(range. Among the items it consumes are the pericarp of the seeds of sierra palm )Tj
T*(\(Prestoea montana\), tabonuco \(Dacryodes excelsa\), and negra lora \(Matayba )Tj
T*(domingensis\); the fruits of bejuco de rana \(Marcgravia sintenisii\), camasey )Tj

T*(grisebachiana\), laurel sabino \(Magnolia splendens\), caimitillo verde )Tj
T*(\(Micropholis garciniaefolia\), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the bark of bejuco de )Tj
T*(rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun \(Psychotria berteriana\); and the buds of )Tj
T*(cuaba \(Inga vera\).[30] It normally selects the fruits positioned directly in )Tj
T*(front of its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions.[31] )Tj
T*(When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food.[32] The Amazon feeds in a )Tj
T*(slow, paused manner taking 8‚Äì60¬†seconds to consume separate items.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Breeding )Tj
T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon usually mates for life, with pairs only changing mates )Tj
T*(if one bird perishes or abandons the nest.[34] A male may abandon the female if )Tj
T*(the latter is injured, re-mating with a more "physically perfect" subject.[34] )Tj
T*(The pairing process is unknown; however, new pairs tend to participate in )Tj
T*(mutual mating dances characterised by coordinated bows, partial extension of )Tj
T*(the wings and full tail expansion.[35] )Tj
T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon is a secondary cavity nester, nesting in tree trunk )Tj
T*(cavities, both naturally occurring and excavated by other species. It prefers )Tj
T*(to nest in Palo colorado trees \(Cyrilla racemiflora\), but uses other trees, )Tj
T*(including the laurel sabino \(Magnolia splendens\) and tabonuco \(Dacryodes )Tj
T*(excelsa\), to a lesser extent. These trees are mature cavity-forming trees which )Tj
T*(provide protection against predators and the entry of water. Recently, the )Tj
T*(species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed as part of the )Tj
T*(recovery plan for the species. Nest height varies from 7‚Äì15¬†m \(23‚Äì49¬†ft\) above )Tj
T*(ground. The male usually leads the search for nest sites, although the final )Tj
T*(decision seems to be taken by the female.[36] Once a site is selected, the pair )Tj
T*(will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it. No lining material is added to )Tj
T*(the nest. )Tj
T*( The Puerto Rican Amazon reaches sexual maturity at 4¬†years of age in the wild )Tj
T*(and at 3¬†years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between )Tj
T*(the months of January and July \(the dry season\). Copulation between pairs seems )Tj
T*(to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a )Tj
T*(trigger for intercourse.[37] Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that )Tj
T*(found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch )Tj
T*(with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back.[38] As the )Tj
T*(time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the )Tj
T*(male providing food to the female via regurgitation.[39] The female lays 2‚Äì4¬†)Tj
T*(eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the )Tj
T*(male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food.[40] )Tj
T*(Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or )Tj
T*(if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame.[41] The chicks are )Tj
T*(fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65¬†days after they )Tj
T*(hatch.[2] Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with )Tj

T*(them until the next breeding season.[3] )Tj
T*( Like other Amazons, the Puerto Rican Amazon is gregarious while performing )Tj
T*(daily activities, but territorial around its nest.[42] The size of the )Tj
T*(territory around the nest is usually around 50¬†meters \(164 feet\).[5] Pairs are )Tj
T*(extremely cautious near their nest, usually moving in a slow manner when )Tj
T*(leaving the nest to avoid the attention of predators.[43] Although territorial )Tj
T*(defense is mostly composed of loud vocalizations there are instances of actual )Tj
T*(physical combat.[44] Pairs will defend their nest sites against invading )Tj
T*(couples, sometimes focusing on the location's defense instead of egg-laying. )Tj
T*(Pairs nesting in areas uninhabited by other parrots will remain mostly silent )Tj
T*(unless other parrots enter the zone.[44] Some pairs may display moderate )Tj
T*(territoriality even when not apparently intending to nest, with these )Tj
T*(tendencies beginning in the latter half of the breeding season. One hypothesis )Tj
T*(is that this would occur in young pairs that had still not reached full )Tj
T*(maturity, serving as "practice territoriality".[45] )Tj
T*( [edit] Threats and conservation )Tj
T*( On March¬†11, 1967, the Puerto Rican Amazon entered the United States Fish and )Tj
T*(Wildlife Service list of endangered species.[46] At the time of inclusion the )Tj
T*(population was estimated at 70 individuals. In 1968, recovery efforts began to )Tj
T*(increase the population in the wild.[47] In 1972, when the estimated population )Tj
T*(was 16 individuals, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \(USFWS\) at the )Tj
T*(Luquillo Aviary began efforts to breed parrots in captivity and yielded good )Tj
T*(results. In June 2006, it was reported by the USFWS that its birds in captivity )Tj
T*(had successfully hatched 39 chicks \(the yearly average is around 16\). In 2006, )Tj
T*(22 birds were released in the Rio Abajo State Forest to initiate a second wild )Tj
T*(population, and a further 19 were released at the same site on 27 December )Tj
T*(2008.[48] )Tj
T*( The World Conservation Union \(IUCN\) lists the Puerto Rican Amazon as a )Tj
T*(critically endangered species since 1994.[1] The species is regulated under )Tj
T*(Appendix¬†I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of )Tj
T*(Wild Fauna and Flora \(CITES\),[49] rendering illegal international trade in )Tj
T*(specimens or parts. )Tj
T*( [edit] Threats )Tj
T*( Human activity is arguably the main reason for the population decline of the )Tj
T*(Puerto Rican Amazon.[18] Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Ta√≠no, )Tj
T*(hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological )Tj
T*(balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the )Tj
T*(pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population )Tj
T*(decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the )Tj
T*(main reason for the decline of population. )Tj
T*( Natural predators of the Puerto Rican Amazon include the Red-tailed Hawk )Tj
T*(\(Buteo jamaicensis\), the Broad-winged Hawk \(Buteo platypterus\), the Peregrine )Tj
T*(Falcon \(Falco peregrinus\) and the Pearly-eyed Thrasher \(Margarops )Tj
T*(fuscatus\).[2][16] The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and )Tj
T*(has been a problem for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, )Tj
T*(specially designed deep nests were prepared for the parrots in subsequent years )Tj
T*(to prevent competition from the invaders.[50] Introduced honeybees \(Apis )Tj
T*(mellifera\), the related Hispaniolan Amazon \(Amazona ventralis\), Black rats )Tj
T*(\(Rattus rattus\) and Indian mongooses \(Herpestes javanicus\) may compete for )Tj
T*(nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.[25] )Tj
T*( Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, were not a threat to the Puerto Rican )Tj
T*(Parrot population when it was more readily self-maintaining, but as a result of )Tj
T*(the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a )Tj
T*(threat as well. Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September )Tj
T*(1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.[51] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recovery plan )Tj
T*( In response to the Puerto Rican Amazon's low population and endangered status, )Tj
T*(a recovery plan was drafted and implemented in 1968. Its main objective was to )Tj

T*( The Bryce Canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was )Tj
T*(named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874.[3] The area )Tj
T*(around Bryce Canyon became a National Monument in 1923 and was designated as a )Tj
T*(National Park in 1928. The park covers 35,835 acres \(55.99¬†sq¬†mi; 145.02¬†)Tj
T*(km2\)[1] and receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion National Park and )Tj
T*(the Grand Canyon, largely due to its remote location. )Tj
T*( [edit] Geography and climate )Tj
T*( Bryce Canyon National Park is located in southwestern Utah about 50 miles \(80¬†)Tj
T*(km\) northeast of and 1,000 feet \(300¬†m\) higher than Zion National Park.[4][5] )Tj
T*(The weather in Bryce Canyon is therefore cooler, and the park receives more )Tj
T*(precipitation: a total of 15 to 18¬†inches \(38 to 46¬†cm\) per year.[6][7] Yearly )Tj
T*(temperatures vary from an average minimum of 9 ¬∞F \(‚àí13¬†¬∞C\) in January to an )Tj
T*(average maximum of 83 ¬∞F \(28¬†¬∞C\) in July, but extreme temperatures can range )Tj
T*(from ‚àí30¬†¬∞F to 97¬†¬∞F \(‚àí34¬†¬∞C to 36¬†¬∞C\).[7] The record high temperature in the )Tj
T*(park was 98 ¬∞F \(37¬†¬∞C\) on July 14, 2002. The record low temperature was ‚àí28 ¬∞F )Tj
T*(\(‚àí33¬†¬∞C\) on December 10, 1972.[8] )Tj
T*( The national park lies within the Colorado Plateau geographic province of )Tj
T*(North America and straddles the southeastern edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau )Tj
T*(west of the Paunsagunt Fault \(Paunsagunt is Paiute for "home of the )Tj
T*(beaver"\).[9] Park visitors arrive from the plateau part of the park and look )Tj
T*(over the plateau's edge toward a valley containing the fault and the Paria )Tj
T*(River just beyond it \(Paria is Paiute for "muddy or elk water"\). The edge of )Tj
T*(the Kaiparowits Plateau bounds the opposite side of the valley. )Tj
T*( Bryce Canyon was not formed from erosion initiated from a central stream, )Tj
T*(meaning it technically is not a canyon. Instead headward erosion has excavated )Tj
T*(large amphitheater-shaped features in the Cenozoic-aged rocks of the Paunsagunt )Tj
T*(Plateau.[9] This erosion exposed delicate and colorful pinnacles called hoodoos )Tj
T*(that are up to 200 feet \(61¬†m\) high. A series of amphitheaters extends more )Tj
T*(than 20 miles \(32¬†km\) north-to-south within the park.[9] The largest is Bryce )Tj
T*(Amphitheater, which is 12 miles \(19¬†km\) long, 3 miles \(4.8¬†km\) wide and 800 )Tj
T*(feet \(240¬†m\) deep.[9] A nearby example of amphitheaters with hoodoos in the )Tj
T*(same formation but at a higher elevation, is in Cedar Breaks National Monument, )Tj
T*(which is 25 miles \(40¬†km\) to the west on the Markagunt Plateau.[5] )Tj
T*( Rainbow Point, the highest part of the park at 9,105 feet \(2,775¬†m\),[10] is at )Tj
T*(the end of the 18-mile \(29¬†km\) scenic drive.[9] From there, Aquarius Plateau, )Tj
T*(Bryce Amphitheater, the Henry Mountains, the Vermilion Cliffs and the White )Tj

T*( [edit] Native American habitation )Tj
T*( Little is known about early human habitation in the Bryce Canyon area. )Tj
T*(Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the Paunsaugunt )Tj

T*(of the park. Other artifacts from the Pueblo-period Anasazi and the Fremont )Tj
T*(culture \(up to the mid-12th century\) have also been found.[11] )Tj
T*( The Paiute Indians moved into the surrounding valleys and plateaus in the area )Tj
T*(around the same time that the other cultures left.[11] These Native Americans )Tj
T*(hunted and gathered for most of their food, but also supplemented their diet )Tj
T*(with some cultivated products. The Paiute in the area developed a mythology )Tj
T*(surrounding the hoodoos \(pinnacles\) in Bryce Canyon. They believed that hoodoos )Tj
T*(were the Legend People whom the trickster Coyote turned to stone.[12] At least )Tj
T*(one older Paiute said his culture called the hoodoos Anka-ku-was-a-wits, which )Tj

T*( The first major scientific expedition to the area was led by U.S. Army Major )Tj
T*(John Wesley Powell in 1872.[11] Powell, along with a team of mapmakers and )Tj
T*(geologists, surveyed the Sevier and Virgin River area as part of a larger )Tj
T*(survey of the Colorado Plateaus. His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place )Tj
T*(names.[9] )Tj
T*( Small groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce )Tj
T*(Canyon along the Paria River. In 1873, the Kanarra Cattle Company started to )Tj
T*(use the area for cattle grazing.[11] )Tj
T*( The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sent Scottish immigrant )Tj
T*(Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because )Tj
T*(they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family )Tj
T*(chose to live right below Bryce Canyon Amphitheater. Bryce grazed his cattle )Tj
T*(inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters )Tj
T*(were a "helluva place to lose a cow."[3] He also built a road to the plateau to )Tj
T*(retrieve firewood and timber, and a canal to irrigate his crops and water his )Tj
T*(animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place "Bryce's )Tj
T*(canyon", which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon. )Tj
T*( A combination of drought, overgrazing and flooding eventually drove the )Tj
T*(remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt )Tj
T*(construction of a water diversion channel from the Sevier River drainage. When )Tj
T*(that effort failed, most of the settlers, including the Bryce family, left the )Tj
T*(area.[9] Bryce moved his family to Arizona in 1880.[7] The remaining settlers )Tj
T*(dug a 10 miles \(16¬†km\) ditch from the Sevier's east fork into Tropic Valley.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Creation of the park )Tj
T*( These scenic areas were first described for the public in magazine articles )Tj
T*(published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916.[3] People like )Tj
T*(Forest Supervisor J. W. Humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon's )Tj
T*(amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark )Tj
T*(interest.[11] However, poor access to the remote area and the lack of )Tj
T*(accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum. )Tj
T*( Ruby Syrett, Harold Bowman and the Perry brothers later built modest lodging, )Tj
T*(and set up "touring services" in the area.[11] Syrett later served as the first )Tj
T*(postmaster of Bryce Canyon. Visitation steadily increased, and by the early )Tj
T*(1920s the Union Pacific Railroad became interested in expanding rail service )Tj
T*(into southwestern Utah to accommodate more tourists.[11] )Tj
T*( At the same time, conservationists became alarmed by the damage overgrazing )Tj
T*(and logging on the plateau, along with unregulated visitation, were having on )Tj
T*(the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was )Tj
T*(soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by )Tj
T*(proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The governor of Utah and )Tj
T*(the Utah Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. )Tj
T*(Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who )Tj
T*(on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon National Monument into existence.[11] )Tj
T*( A road was built the same year on the plateau to provide easy access to )Tj
T*(outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, Bryce Canyon Lodge was )Tj
T*(built from local timber and stone.[13] )Tj
T*( Members of U.S. Congress started work in 1924 on upgrading Bryce Canyon's )Tj
T*(protection status from a U.S. National Monument to a National Park in order to )Tj
T*(establish Utah National Park.[13] A process led by the Utah Parks Company for )Tj
T*(transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument to the )Tj
T*(federal government started in 1923.[11] The last of the land in the proposed )Tj
T*(park's borders was sold to the federal government four years later, and on )Tj
T*(February 25, 1928, the renamed Bryce Canyon National Park was established.[14] )Tj
T*( In 1931, President Herbert Hoover annexed an adjoining area south of the park, )Tj
T*(and in 1942 an additional 635 acres \(2.57¬†km2\) was added.[11] This brought the )Tj
T*(park's total area to the current figure of 35,835 acres \(145.02¬†km2\).[14] Rim )Tj
T*(Road, the scenic drive that is still used today, was completed in 1934 by the )Tj
T*(Civilian Conservation Corps. Administration of the park was conducted from )Tj
T*(neighboring Zion Canyon National Park until 1956, when Bryce Canyon's first )Tj
T*(superintendent started work.[11] )Tj

T*( [edit] More recent history )Tj
T*( The USS Bryce Canyon was named for the park and served as a supply and repair )Tj
T*(ship in the U.S. Pacific Fleet from September 15, 1950, to June 30, 1981.[15] )Tj
T*( Bryce Canyon Natural History Association \(BCNHA\) was established in 1961.[16] )Tj
T*(It runs the bookstore inside the park visitor center and is a non-profit )Tj
T*(organization created to aid the interpretive, educational and scientific )Tj
T*(activities of the National Park Service at Bryce Canyon National Park. A )Tj
T*(portion of the profits from all bookstore sales are donated to public land )Tj
T*(units. )Tj
T*( Responding to increased visitation and traffic congestion, the National Park )Tj
T*(Service implemented a voluntary, summer-only, in-park shuttle system in June )Tj
T*(2000. In 2004, reconstruction began on the aging and inadequate road system in )Tj
T*(the park. )Tj
T*( [edit] Geology )Tj
T*( The Bryce Canyon area shows a record of deposition that spans from the last )Tj
T*(part of the Cretaceous period and the first half of the Cenozoic era. The )Tj
T*(ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now the park )Tj
T*(varied. The Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, )Tj
T*(shallow waters of the advancing and retreating Cretaceous Seaway \(outcrops of )Tj
T*(these rocks are found just outside park borders\).[17] The colorful Claron )Tj
T*(Formation, from which the park's delicate hoodoos are carved, was laid down as )Tj
T*(sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about )Tj
T*(40¬†million years ago \(from the Paleocene to the Eocene epochs\). Different )Tj
T*(sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as )Tj
T*(the shoreline and river deltas migrated. )Tj
T*( Several other formations were also created but were mostly eroded away )Tj
T*(following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny affected the entire )Tj
T*(western part of what would become North America starting about 70¬†million to 50¬†)Tj
T*(million years ago.[14] This event helped to build the Rocky Mountains and in )Tj
T*(the process closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and )Tj
T*(Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The Colorado Plateaus were )Tj
T*(uplifted 16¬†million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus, each )Tj
T*(separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own uplift rate.[10] )Tj
T*(The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by )Tj
T*(erosion following this uplift. )Tj
T*( Vertical joints were created by this uplift, which were eventually \(and still )Tj
T*(are\) preferentially eroded. The easily eroded Pink Cliffs of the Claron )Tj
T*(Formation responded by forming freestanding pinnacles in badlands called )Tj
T*(hoodoos, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths.[9] The brown, )Tj
T*(pink and red colors are from hematite \(iron oxide; Fe2O3\); the yellows from )Tj
T*(limonite \(FeO\(OH\)¬∑nH2O\); and the purples are from pyrolusite \(MnO2\).[18] Also )Tj
T*(created were arches, natural bridges, walls, and windows. Hoodoos are composed )Tj
T*(of soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder, less easily )Tj
T*(eroded stone that protects the column from the elements. Bryce Canyon has one )Tj
T*(of the highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on Earth. )Tj
T*( The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the Grand )Tj
T*(Staircase. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed )Tj
T*(in the Grand Canyon, the intermediate ones in Zion National Park, and its )Tj
T*(youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap )Tj
T*(occurs in and around each park. )Tj
T*( [edit] Biology )Tj
T*( More than 400 native plant species live in the park. There are three life )Tj
T*(zones in the park based on elevation:[13] The lowest areas of the park are )Tj
T*(dominated by dwarf forests of pinyon pine and juniper with manzanita, )Tj
T*(serviceberry, and antelope bitterbrush in between. Aspen, cottonwood, Water )Tj
T*(Birch, and Willow grow along streams. Ponderosa Pine forests cover the )Tj
T*(mid-elevations with Blue Spruce and Douglas-fir in water-rich areas and )Tj
T*(manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas-fir and White Fir, along with )Tj

T*( The forests and meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the habitat to support diverse )Tj
T*(animal life, from birds and small mammals to foxes and occasional bobcats, )Tj
T*(mountain lions, and black bears.[12]Mule deer are the most common large mammals )Tj
T*(in the park.[12]Elk and pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, )Tj
T*(sometimes venture into the park.[12] )Tj
T*( Bryce Canyon National Park forms part of the habitat of three wildlife species )Tj
T*(that are listed under the Endangered Species Act: the Utah Prairie Dog, the )Tj
T*(California Condor, and the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher.[19] The Utah Prairie )Tj
T*(Dog is a threatened species that was reintroduced to the park for conservation, )Tj
T*(and the largest protected population is found within the park's boundaries.[20] )Tj
T*( About 170 species of birds visit the park each year, including swifts and )Tj
T*(swallows.[7] Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although jays, )Tj
T*(ravens, nuthatches, eagles, and owls stay.[12] In winter, the mule deer, )Tj
T*(mountain lion, and coyotes migrate to lower elevations.[12]Ground squirrels and )Tj
T*(marmots pass the winter in hibernation.[12] )Tj
T*( Eleven species of reptiles and four species of amphibians have been found at )Tj
T*(in the park.[21] Reptiles include the Great Basin Rattlesnake, Short-horned )Tj
T*(Lizard, Side-blotched Lizard, Striped Whipsnake, and the Tiger Salamander.[21] )Tj
T*( Also in the park are the black, lumpy, very slow-growing colonies of )Tj
T*(cryptobiotic soil, which are a mix of lichens, algae, fungi, and cyanobacteria. )Tj
T*(Together these organisms slow erosion, add nitrogen to soil, and help it to )Tj
T*(retain moisture. )Tj
T*( While humans have greatly reduced the amount of habitat that is available to )Tj
T*(wildlife in most parts of the United States, the relative scarcity of water in )Tj
T*(southern Utah restricts human development and helps account for the region's )Tj
T*(greatly enhanced diversity of wildlife. )Tj
T*( [edit] Activities )Tj
T*( Most park visitors sightsee using the scenic drive, which provides access to )Tj
T*(13 viewpoints over the amphitheaters. Bryce Canyon has eight marked and )Tj
T*(maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less than a day \(round trip time, )Tj
T*(trailhead\):[22] Mossy Cave \(one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic\), Rim )Tj
T*(Trail \(5‚Äì6 hours, anywhere on rim\), Bristlecone Loop \(one hour, Rainbow Point\), )Tj
T*(and Queens Garden \(1‚Äì2 hours, Sunrise Point\) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo )Tj
T*(Loop \(1‚Äì2 hours, Sunset Point\) and Tower Bridge \(2‚Äì3 hours, north of Sunrise )Tj
T*(Point\) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop \(4‚Äì5 hours, Fairyland Point\) and )Tj
T*(Peekaboo Loop \(3‚Äì4 hours, Bryce Point\) are strenuous hikes. Several of these )Tj
T*(trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes. )Tj
T*( The park also has two trails designated for overnight hiking: the 9-mile \(14¬†)Tj
T*(km\) Riggs Spring Loop Trail and the 23-mile \(37¬†km\) Under-the-Rim Trail.[23] )Tj
T*(Both require a backcountry camping permit. In total there are 50 miles \(80¬†km\) )Tj
T*(of trails in the park. )Tj
T*( More than 10 miles \(16¬†km\) of marked but ungroomed skiing trails are available )Tj
T*(off of Fairyland, Paria, and Rim trails in the park. Twenty miles \(32¬†km\) of )Tj
T*(connecting groomed ski trails are in nearby Dixie National Forest and Ruby's )Tj
T*(Inn. )Tj
T*( The air in the area is so clear that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow )Tj
T*(points, Navajo Mountain and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen 90 miles \(140¬†km\) )Tj
T*(away in Arizona.[24] On extremely clear days, the Black Mesas of eastern )Tj
T*(Arizona and western New Mexico can be seen some 160 miles \(260¬†km\) away.[24] )Tj
T*( The park also has a 7.4¬†magnitude night sky, making it one of the darkest in )Tj
T*(North America.[25] Stargazers can therefore see 7,500 stars with the naked eye, )Tj
T*(while in most places fewer than 2,000 can be seen due to light pollution \(in )Tj
T*(many large cities only a few dozen can be seen\). Park rangers host public )Tj
T*(stargazing events and evening programs on astronomy, nocturnal animals, and )Tj
T*(night sky protection. The Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival, typically held in )Tj
T*(June, attracts thousands of visitors. In honor of this astronomy festival, )Tj

T*( Suillus spraguei is a species of fungus in the Suillaceae family. It is known )Tj
T*(by a variety of common names, including the painted slipperycap, the painted )Tj
T*(suillus or the red and yellow suillus. Suillus spraguei has had a complex )Tj
T*(taxonomical history, and is also frequently referred to Suillus pictus in the )Tj
T*(literature. The readily identifiable fruit bodies have caps that are dark red )Tj
T*(when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that )Tj
T*(are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, )Tj
T*(angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The stalk bears a )Tj
T*(grayish cottony ring, and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales. )Tj
T*( Suillus spraguei grows in a mycorrhizal association with several pine species, )Tj
T*(particularly eastern white pine, and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, )Tj
T*(appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a disjunct distribution, and is )Tj
T*(found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout the )Tj
T*(range of the host tree. The mushroom is edible, although opinions about its )Tj
T*(quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other Suillus )Tj
T*(species, including the closely related S.¬†decipiens, although the species can )Tj
T*(be differentiated by variations in color and size. )Tj
T*( [edit] Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming )Tj
T*( Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomic history. Although the first )Tj
T*(specimen was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James )Tj
T*(Sprague, a formal scientific description was not published until 1872 when )Tj
T*(Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it Boletus spraguei. In a )Tj
T*(publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist Charles )Tj
T*(Horton Peck named the species Boletus pictus. Berkeley and Curtis had also )Tj
T*(described what they believed to be a new species‚ÄîBoletus murraii‚Äîalthough this )Tj
T*(was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their )Tj
T*(Boletus spraguei.[6] Although Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, the )Tj
T*(date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents )Tj
T*(to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis )Tj
T*(publication, thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal )Tj
T*(naming.[7] However, in 1945 Singer reported that the name Boletus pictus was )Tj
T*(illegitimate because it was a homonym, already being used for a polypore )Tj
T*(mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806.[6][nb 1] The name was )Tj
T*(officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 \(Otto Kuntze had previously )Tj
T*(transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898\).[5][nb 2] )Tj
T*( A 1996 molecular analysis of 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their )Tj
T*(internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify )Tj
T*(the taxonomy of the genus. The results indicate that S.¬†spraguei is most )Tj
T*(closely related to S.¬†decipiens. The species S.¬†granulatus and S.¬†placidus lie )Tj

T*(corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships )Tj
T*(between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including )Tj
T*(S.¬†spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.¬†)Tj

T*(spraguei.[13][14] )Tj
T*( The specific epithet spraguei is an homage to the collector Sprague, while )Tj
T*(pictus means "painted" or "colored".[15]Suillus spraguei is commonly known as )Tj
T*(the "painted slipperycap",[16] the "painted suillus", or the "red and yellow )Tj
T*(suillus".[17] It is also called the "eastern painted Suillus" to contrast with )Tj
T*(the "western painted Suillus" \(Suillus lakei\).[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The cap of the fruit body is 3 to 12 cm \(1.2 to 4.7 in\) in diameter, and )Tj
T*(depending on its age, is either conic to convex, to somewhat flattened at )Tj
T*(maturity. The cap margin is initially rolled downward before straightening out, )Tj
T*(often with hanging remnants of partial veil \(appendiculate\).[19] The cap )Tj
T*(surface is covered with densely matted filaments that are rough and scale-like. )Tj
T*(The scales are pink to brownish red, fading to a pale brown-gray or dull yellow )Tj
T*(in maturity. Under the scales, the cap surface is yellow to pale yellow-orange. )Tj
T*(While many other Suillus species have a sticky or slimy cap, S.¬†spraguei is )Tj
T*(dry. The flesh is yellow.[20] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The cap surface has scales or mats of reddish hairs; in this older specimen )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The partial veil is beginning to tear, exposing the pore surface. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The pores on the underside of the cap are yellowish and angular, measuring 0.5 )Tj
T*(to 5 mm \(0.02 to 0.20 in\) wide, and formed by tubes that extend 4 to 8 mm \(0.2 )Tj
T*(to 0.3 in\) deep.[19] These pores have a slightly decurrent attachment to the )Tj
T*(stem \(extending down its length\). Young specimens have a whitish fibrous )Tj
T*(partial veil that protects the developing pores; as the cap expands it rips the )Tj
T*(veil, which remains as a grayish ring on the stem. The stem is 4 to 12 cm \(1.6 )Tj
T*(to 4.7 in\) long, and 1 to 2.5 cm \(0.4 to 1.0 in\) thick, roughly cylindrical in )Tj
T*(shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat )Tj
T*(club-shaped.[19][20] The stem surface is tomentose, with scales at the top, and )Tj
T*(a ring on the upper half of the stem. Below the ring the stem is fibrillose, )Tj
T*(covered with a mat of soft hairs. Its color at the top is yellow, but with )Tj
T*(wine-red to reddish-brown scales below, underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish )Tj
T*(color.[20] The stem is usually solid, rarely hollow.[16] The tissue of all )Tj
T*(parts of the fruit body‚Äîcap, pores, and stem‚Äîwill turn brownish shortly after )Tj

T*( [edit] Edibility )Tj
T*( Suillus spraguei is an edible mushroom.[23] Its taste is not distinctive, )Tj
T*(although the odor has been described as "slightly fruity".[20] Although it )Tj
T*(turns a blackish color when cooked,[21] some consider it choice,[15] and "among )Tj
T*(the better edibles in the genus Suillus."[21] In contrast, another source on )Tj
T*(mushrooms of Qu√©bec described the mushroom as a poor edible \("comestible )Tj
T*(m√©diocre"\), and warned of a slightly acidic taste and disagreeable flavor.[24] )Tj
T*(Michael Kuo's 2007 book 100 Edible Mushrooms rates the taste as mediocre, )Tj
T*(suggesting "its sluglike consistency has all the palatability of unflavored )Tj
T*(gelatin." The book recommends frying the thinly-sliced mushroom in butter or )Tj
T*(oil until it acquires a crispy texture.[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] Similar species )Tj
T*( S.¬†spraguei is a popular edible among novice mushroom hunters as it is readily )Tj
T*(identifiable due to both its appearance and its association with White Pine. )Tj
T*(Although this distinctiveness renders it unlikely to be confused with other )Tj
T*(species,[17] it does share similar characteristics with several other Suillus )Tj
T*(species. S.¬†spraguei bears some resemblance to the rosy larch bolete \(S.¬†)Tj
T*(ochraceoroseus\),[25] but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker )Tj
T*(stem, and grows in association with larch.[26]S.¬†cavipes, another associate of )Tj
T*(larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk.[27]S.¬†lakei is less )Tj
T*(brightly colored than S.¬†spraguei, has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with )Tj
T*(Douglas fir.[28]S.¬†decipiens has a less intensely red cap when young, but the )Tj
T*(color of older specimens fade and can resemble S.¬†spraguei. S.¬†decipiens )Tj
T*(generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from 4 to 7 cm \(1.6 to 2.8 )Tj
T*(in\) in diameter, and stem that is typically 4‚Äì7¬†cm \(1.6‚Äì2.8¬†in\) long by 0.7‚Äì1.6¬†)Tj
T*(cm \(0.3‚Äì0.6¬†in\) thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring )Tj
T*(0.5‚Äì1¬†mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of hazel rather than )Tj
T*(reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern United States, from New )Tj
T*(Jersey south to Florida and west to Texas.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ecology, habitat and distribution )Tj
T*( In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with )Tj
T*(five-needled pine species.[30] This is a mutually beneficial relationship where )Tj
T*(the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the trees, enabling the )Tj
T*(fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, )Tj
T*(and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.¬†spraguei produces )Tj
T*(tuberculate ectomycorrhizae \(covered with wart-like projections\) that are )Tj
T*(described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and )Tj
T*(rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath.[30] The )Tj
T*(fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate )Tj
T*(with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the )Tj
T*(genus Pinus.[31] However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the )Tj
T*(laboratory, S.¬†spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, )Tj
T*(Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine.[32] Asian populations have been associated with )Tj
T*(Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine,[13]Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White )Tj
T*(Pine.[33] In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other )Tj
T*(boletes, as early as June \(bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in )Tj
T*(July‚ÄìSeptember\),[34] although they may be found as late as October.[17] )Tj
T*(Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual )Tj

T*(\(comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all )Tj

T*( During the off-season the Phillies named Rub√©n Amaro, Jr. general manager, )Tj

T*(most notable offseason player change was in left field, as Pat Burrell departed )Tj
T*(due to free agency and was replaced by free agent Ra√∫l Ib√°√±ez.[3] Another )Tj
T*(notable acquisition was free agent pitcher Chan Ho Park.[4] Park was originally )Tj

T*( During the regular season, the Phillies led the National League East for most )Tj

T*(Lee won seven of his twelve regular season starts for Philadelphia in 2009.[9] )Tj
T*(Ib√°√±ez had started the year strongly, batting well over .300 with 17 home runs )Tj

T*(returned he did not bat above .260 for any other month that season.[10][12] )Tj
T*(Although Ib√°√±ez did not receive MVP votes his teammates Ryan Howard and Chase )Tj
T*(Utley had successful years, finishing 3rd and 8th in the balloting )Tj

T*( Jimmy Rollins, discussing the potential of a Yankees‚ÄìPhillies World Series on )Tj
T*(May 24, 2009.[28] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The two teams had met for a three-game interleague series at Yankee Stadium in )Tj
T*(May 2009, with the Phillies winning two of the three games.[29] The series )Tj
T*(included two blown saves by Phillies' closer Brad Lidge in games 2 and 3, )Tj
T*(although the Phillies came back to win the final game in extra innings.[29] )Tj
T*( The Yankees had home field advantage for the Series as the American League had )Tj
T*(won that year's All-Star Game.[30] The team match-up was heavily discussed and )Tj
T*(analyzed in the media prior to the beginning of the series. Both teams' )Tj
T*(offensive lineups were heavily touted,[31][32][33][34] with the Yankees and )Tj
T*(Phillies leading their respective leagues in runs scored per game.[35] Yankees )Tj
T*(third baseman Alex Rodriguez drew particular focus in the media for his success )Tj
T*(in earlier rounds of the 2009 playoffs in contrast to past postseason )Tj
T*(performances.[36][37][38] The two lineups featured twenty former All-Stars and )Tj
T*(three former MVP award winners.[32] Only one regular starter between both )Tj
T*(teams, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, did not have at least ten home runs during )Tj
T*(the 2009 regular season.[32] The two teams combined for 468 home runs during )Tj
T*(the season, more than any pair of opponents in World Series history.[32] )Tj
T*( The pitching staffs were also the subject of significant discussion prior to )Tj
T*(the series.[33] The starting pitchers for Game¬†1, CC Sabathia and Cliff Lee, )Tj
T*(were described as "aces"[34] who "dominated" the 2009 postseason with a 0.96 )Tj
T*(earned run average \(ERA\) between them.[39] This matchup was of particular note, )Tj
T*(as Sabathia and Lee were former teammates from the Cleveland Indians and each )Tj
T*(had won a Cy Young Award with that franchise.[39][40][41] Yankees manager Joe )Tj
T*(Girardi had been using a three-man starting rotation during the playoffs, in )Tj
T*(contrast to the four-pitcher rotation used by the Phillies.[42][43] This )Tj

T*(the playoffs, making it more conducive to the Phillies' strategy.[43]Gene )Tj
T*(Wojciechowski of ESPN criticized Girardi's strategy, arguing that Chad Gaudin )Tj
T*(should have pitched in Game¬†5 or 6, instead of A. J. Burnett or Andy Pettitte )Tj
T*(on reduced, three days rest.[44] Wojciechowski argued that while Sabathia had )Tj
T*(proven his ability to pitch on shorter rest, Burnett and Pettitte should have )Tj
T*(been given their regular time between starts.[44] Burnett had drawn some )Tj
T*(criticism, as he performed poorly in his last appearance before the World )Tj
T*(Series,[39] a start in Game¬†5 of the ALCS in which he allowed six runs over six )Tj
T*(innings.[45] Some believed Girardi settled on a three-man rotation because he )Tj
T*(had limited options for a fourth starting pitcher, either Gaudin or Joba )Tj
T*(Chamberlain, who had been "erratic" as a starter in the regular season and had )Tj
T*(been shifted into the bullpen for the postseason.[44][46][47] )Tj
T*( The matchup of closers, Mariano Rivera and Brad Lidge, also drew attention. )Tj
T*(Rivera and Lidge were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 )Tj
T*(postseason, whereas closers on other postseason teams blew 11 saves in the 24 )Tj
T*(postseason games before the World Series in 2009.[48] Both had performed well )Tj
T*(during the postseason, but Lidge had posted a 7.21 ERA during the 2009 regular )Tj
T*(season, in contrast to Rivera's 1.76.[48][49] As a result, USA Today gave the )Tj
T*(Yankees the edge, noting that Lidge had blown two saves against the Yankees )Tj
T*(during their regular season series earlier that year.[43] )Tj
T*( [edit] Series summary )Tj
T*( The Series started on October 28, 2009, which was the latest start in World )Tj
T*(Series history.[50] Game¬†4 was played on Sunday, November 1 and the )Tj
T*(series-winning Game¬†6 took place on November 4. The Series was only the third )Tj
T*(to end in a month other than October. The first came in 1918, which was played )Tj
T*(entirely in September after the regular season was cut short due to World War )Tj
T*(I.[51] The other such series was in 2001 when the September 11 attacks caused a )Tj
T*(delay in the baseball season that eventually forced the end of the World Series )Tj
T*(into November.[52] )Tj
T*( Earlier in the season Commissioner Bud Selig expressed interest in scheduling )Tj
T*(a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening.[53] The )Tj
T*(starting times were ultimately moved before 8¬†p.m. ET for the first time in 30 )Tj
T*(years, but no day games were played.[54][55] The Philadelphia Eagles and New )Tj
T*(York Giants of the National Football League \(NFL\) played across the street from )Tj
T*(Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game¬†4. The NFL )Tj
T*(moved that game's kickoff time to 1¬†p.m. to avoid it ending too close to the )Tj
T*(start of Game¬†4.[56] Similarly, Game¬†5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the )Tj
T*(same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the )Tj
T*(National Hockey League \(NHL\) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the )Tj
T*(hockey game was scheduled for 7¬†p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5¬†p.m. to avoid )Tj
T*(conflict.[57] )Tj
T*( The umpires for the series were Joe West, Dana DeMuth, Gerry Davis, Brian )Tj
T*(Gorman, Jeff Nelson, and Mike Everitt.[58] The World Series crew had included )Tj
T*(at least 1 umpire who had never worked the World Series in 24 of the past 25 )Tj
T*(series; however, following several mistakes by umpires in earlier rounds of the )Tj
T*(playoffs, this crew did not.[59][60][61] )Tj
T*( The Phillies had won the previous season's World Series against the Tampa Bay )Tj
T*(Rays for the franchise's second championship. The Yankees lost their previous )Tj
T*(World Series appearance to the Florida Marlins in 2003 and had not won since )Tj
T*(2000 against the New York Mets. This was the fifth Series played between teams )Tj
T*(from New York and Philadelphia, and was the first Yankees‚ÄìPhillies matchup )Tj
T*(since 1950.[62] The series was also the fourth consecutive time that the )Tj
T*(Phillies faced a team from the current AL East in the World Series, while the )Tj
T*(Yankees had faced a NL East opponent in three of their four most recent World )Tj
T*(Series appearances.[1] This Series was nicknamed the "Turnpike Series", for the )Tj
T*(New Jersey Turnpike, which connects New York to Philadelphia through the state )Tj
T*(of New Jersey.[31] Major League Baseball nicknamed it the "Liberty Series", )Tj
T*(based on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia and the Statue of Liberty in New )Tj

T*(Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and )Tj
T*(striking out ten batters, not walking any of the hitters he faced.[65] )Tj
T*( Lee's pitching performance made history in several ways:[66] )Tj
T*( This was the fourth postseason start of Lee's career. In all four starts, he )Tj
T*(went at least seven innings and gave up no more than one earned run. The only )Tj
T*(other starting pitcher ever to begin his postseason career with four such )Tj
T*(starts was Christy Mathewson.)Tj
T*(He was also the first left-handed starter to beat the Yankees in The Bronx to )Tj

T*(He was the first starting pitcher to throw a complete game without giving up an )Tj

T*(RBI single to Jorge Posada.[70] With Cabrera at second base and Posada at )Tj
T*(first, Johnny Damon hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. )Tj
T*(Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called )Tj
T*(out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that )Tj
T*(Howard had caught the ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending )Tj

T*(the bottom of the second inning.[79] Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top )Tj
T*(of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. )Tj
T*(It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was )Tj
T*(reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a )Tj

T*(run,[80] giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit.[81] This was the first )Tj
T*(home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play.[80] Specifically, the )Tj
T*(ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right )Tj
T*(field wall.[80] The camera was moved back for Game¬†4 such that its lens was in )Tj

T*(regular season home run reviewed by replay.[82] )Tj
T*( Nick Swisher opened the top of the fifth inning with a double and scored on a )Tj

T*(bottom of the seventh and retired the side in order. Brett Myers retired the )Tj
T*(first two batters in the top of the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a solo )Tj
T*(home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain.[84] Phil Hughes pitched a third of an )Tj
T*(inning in the bottom of the ninth and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz )Tj
T*(before being relieved by Mariano Rivera.[79] Rivera closed out the game, )Tj

T*(from Rivera, Lee, and Pettitte; and Johnny Damon's cleats.[139] )Tj
T*( [edit] Yankees )Tj
T*( The series win brought the Yankees' franchise championship total to )Tj
T*(27,[111][140] more than any other North American professional sports franchise. )Tj
T*(This championship came in the Yankees' first year in their new stadium. They )Tj
T*(had also won the 1923 World Series, the opening year of the previous Yankee )Tj
T*(Stadium.[141] The victory was noted by some sportswriters as a personal success )Tj
T*(for Alex Rodriguez, winning his first championship and succeeding in the )Tj
T*(playoffs where some had previously claimed he was a "choker and a )Tj
T*(loser".[142][143][144] Prior to this series, Rodriguez had appeared in 2,166 )Tj
T*(regular season games without a World Series appearance, then the second-most )Tj
T*(among active players to Ken Griffey, Jr.[142][144] )Tj
T*( On November 6, a victory parade took place for the Yankees in the "Canyon of )Tj
T*(Heroes" in Manhattan, New York City.[145] The Yankees sent a group of players, )Tj
T*(coach Tony Pe√±a, and team Senior Vice President Felix Lopez with the )Tj
T*(Commissioner's Trophy to the Dominican Republic in early January 2010 to meet )Tj
T*(with President Leonel Fern√°ndez.[146][147] Most of the 2009 Yankees received )Tj
T*(their championship rings on Opening Day the next season.[148] Matsui was on the )Tj
T*(Angels in 2010 and when the Angels played their first series of the season in )Tj
T*(the Bronx, the Yankees home opener, they presented him with his ring.[149] They )Tj
T*(also visited U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House in April 2010, )Tj
T*(presenting him with a signed jersey.[150] )Tj
T*( The Yankees' victory was credited to a number of different sources.[151] Many )Tj
T*(players drew praise for their performances, including Series MVP Hideki )Tj
T*(Matsui;[109] free agents signed the previous offseason including Mark Teixeira, )Tj
T*(CC Sabathia, and A. J. Burnett;[152] and the so-called "Core Four" of Derek )Tj
T*(Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, and Jorge Posada, who had all played a )Tj
T*(large role in the Yankees' past success in the 1990s.[153][154][155] Manager )Tj
T*(Joe Girardi was also credited for his management of the team,[156] particularly )Tj
T*(in his decision to use only three starting pitchers in the Yankees postseason )Tj
T*(starting rotation.[157] The Yankees were the first team to use only three )Tj
T*(starters in a World Series since the San Diego Padres in the 1998 Series.[46] )Tj
T*(Several members of the Yankees franchise dedicated the World Series in part to )Tj
T*(team owner George Steinbrenner, who had recently stepped back from his once )Tj
T*(prominent position with the team.[158] Steinbrenner died on the day of the )Tj
T*(All-Star Game the following season at the age of 80.[159] The Yankees returned )Tj
T*(to the playoffs the following season and ultimately lost to the Texas Rangers )Tj
T*(in the 2010 ALCS.[160] )Tj
T*( [edit] Phillies )Tj
T*( Following Game¬†4, after the Yankees took a 3‚Äì1 series lead, The Philadelphia )Tj
T*(Inquirer accidentally printed a three-quarters-page Macy's advertisement )Tj
T*(congratulating the Phillies for winning the World Series, along with a picture )Tj
T*(of a Phillies championship T-shirt. The newspaper subsequently apologized for )Tj
T*(the mistake.[161] Lee Jenkins of Sports Illustrated attributed Philadelphia's )Tj
T*(loss to a lack of pitching depth, noting that three different Yankees starters )Tj
T*(managed to win games in the series, while only Cliff Lee won games for the )Tj
T*(Phillies.[162] Jorge Arangure Jr. of ESPN partially attributed the Phillies' )Tj
T*(loss to their lack of offensive production, citing the team's .227 batting )Tj
T*(average in the World Series.[163] The Phillies also returned to the playoffs in )Tj
T*(2010 and lost to the eventual champions the San Francisco Giants in the )Tj
T*(NLCS.[164] The Phillies again returned to the playoffs in 2011 losing out to )Tj
T*(the eventual champions again \(St. Louis Cardinals\) in the first round NL )Tj
T*(divisional series. )Tj
T*( [edit] David Paterson ticket scandal )Tj
T*( Among those in attendance during Game¬†1 was New York Governor David Paterson, )Tj
T*(whose party had five tickets behind home plate. On March 3, 2010, the New York )Tj
T*(Commission on Public Integrity found that Paterson had violated state laws )Tj
T*(concerning gifts to public officials, and that he lied under oath to the )Tj
T*(commission about his intent to pay for the tickets.[165] The commission further )Tj
T*(found that Paterson used his position to solicit and receive the five )Tj

T*(However, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for )Tj
T*(their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including )Tj

T*(Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much )Tj

T*( To date, the band has sold over 31.5 million records in the U.S,[2] and an )Tj
T*(estimated 60 million worldwide.[3][4] Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its )Tj

T*(but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and )Tj
T*(bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner.[7] In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began )Tj
T*(playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band )Tj
T*(Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing )Tj

T*(band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July )Tj
T*(1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose.[8] )Tj
T*( Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting )Tj
T*(demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material )Tj
T*(that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.[9] After a few )Tj

T*(whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to )Tj
T*(reconnect with Ament.[1] After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a )Tj
T*(five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former )Tj
T*(Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be )Tj
T*(interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt )Tj
T*(might fit the lead vocal position.[9] )Tj
T*( Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball buddy, San )Tj
T*(Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder.[10] Vedder was the lead vocalist for a )Tj
T*(San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened )Tj
T*(to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him.[9] He then )Tj
T*(recorded the vocals to three of the songs \("Alive", "Once", and "Footsteps"\) in )Tj
T*(what he later described as a "mini-opera" entitled Momma-Son.[11] Vedder sent )Tj
T*(the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were )Tj
T*(impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, )Tj
T*(Vedder had joined the band.[9] )Tj
T*( With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie )Tj
T*(Blaylock, in reference to the then-active All-Star basketball player. The band )Tj
T*(played its first official show at the Off Ramp Caf√© in Seattle on October 22, )Tj
T*(1990,[12] and soon signed to Epic Records. However, concerns about trademark )Tj
T*(issues necessitated a name change; the band's name became "Pearl Jam".[6] In an )Tj
T*(early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name "Pearl Jam" was a )Tj
T*(reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American )Tj
T*(and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.[13] In a 2006 Rolling Stone )Tj
T*(cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was "total bullshit", even )Tj
T*(though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained )Tj
T*(that Ament came up with "pearl", and that the band later settled on "Pearl Jam" )Tj
T*(after attending a concert by Neil Young, in which he extended his songs as )Tj
T*(improvisations of 15‚Äì20 minutes in length.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ten and the grunge explosion: 1991‚Äì1992 )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its )Tj
T*(debut album, Ten[14] McCready said that "Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and )Tj
T*(Eddie were along for the ride at that time."[15] Krusen left the band in May )Tj
T*(1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation;[16] he was replaced by Matt )Tj
T*(Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians. )Tj
T*(After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the "Alive" )Tj
T*(video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live band.[17] Chamberlain )Tj
T*(suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and )Tj
T*(played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting Ten. )Tj
T*( Released on August 27, 1991, Ten \(named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey )Tj
T*(number\)[13] contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, )Tj
T*(suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten's musical style, influenced by classic )Tj
T*(rock, combined an "expansive harmonic vocabulary" with an anthemic sound.[18] )Tj
T*(The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a )Tj
T*(breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the )Tj
T*(Billboard charts.[14]Ten produced the hit singles "Alive", "Even Flow", and )Tj
T*("Jeremy". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,[9] Vedder later revealed )Tj

T*(song "Jeremy" \(¬†sample¬†\(help¬∑info\)\) and its accompanying video were inspired by )Tj
T*(a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his )Tj
T*(classmates.[19]Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for more than two years, and )Tj
T*(has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13x )Tj
T*(platinum.[20] )Tj
T*( With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge )Tj
T*(explosion, along with Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was )Tj
T*(criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME said that Pearl Jam )Tj
T*(was "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets."[21] Nirvana's )Tj
T*(Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial )Tj
T*(sellouts,[22] and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so )Tj
T*(many prominent guitar leads.[14] Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they )Tj
T*(reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994.[1] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that )Tj
T*("essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour," adding, "We told the record )Tj
T*(company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to )Tj
T*(get out and play.'"[23] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, "Once people )Tj
T*(came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you )Tj
T*(kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it."[15] Early on in )Tj
T*(Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. )Tj
T*(Looking back at this time, Vedder said that "playing music and then getting a )Tj
T*(shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an )Tj
T*(untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being )Tj
T*(let out of the gates."[24] In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on )Tj
T*(Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on that summer's )Tj
T*(Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, and Ministry, )Tj
T*(among others. The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 )Tj
T*(Cameron Crowe film Singles: "State of Love and Trust" and "Breath". Ament, )Tj
T*(Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name "Citizen Dick"; their )Tj
T*(parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock. )Tj
T*( [edit] Dealing with success: 1993‚Äì1995 )Tj
T*( The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the )Tj
T*(burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.[9] While Pearl Jam )Tj
T*(received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for )Tj
T*("Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to )Tj
T*(make a video for "Black" in spite of pressure by the label. This action began a )Tj
T*(trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs, despite it being )Tj
T*(common knowledge that music videos were one of the most vital sales tools any )Tj
T*(band had in its arsenal. However, Vedder felt that the concept of music videos )Tj
T*(robbed the listener from creating their own interpretation of the song stating )Tj
T*(that "Before music videos first came out, you‚Äôd listen to a song with )Tj
T*(headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you‚Äôd come )Tj
T*(up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a )Tj
T*(sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these )Tj
T*(visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression."[25] )Tj
T*("Ten years from now," Ament said, "I don't want people to remember our songs as )Tj
T*(videos."[9] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of )Tj
T*(following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, "The band was )Tj
T*(blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy."[26] Released on October )Tj
T*(19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week )Tj
T*(of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that )Tj

T*(its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 )Tj
T*(album, Double Live.[28]Vs. included the singles "Go", "Daughter", "Animal", and )Tj
T*("Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, "Few American bands have arrived )Tj
T*(more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that )Tj

T*(Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of )Tj
T*(experiment and strife."[29] The band decided, beginning with the release of )Tj
T*(Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts.[30] The members declined to produce )Tj
T*(any more music videos after the massive success of "Jeremy" and opted for fewer )Tj
T*(interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's )Tj
T*(tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band "ignored )Tj
T*(the press and took its music directly to the fans."[31] During the Vs. Tour, )Tj
T*(the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.[32] )Tj
T*( By 1994, Pearl Jam was "fighting on all fronts", as its manager described the )Tj
T*(band at the time.[33] Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of )Tj
T*(shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had )Tj
T*(added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their )Tj
T*(concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the )Tj
T*(service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was )Tj
T*(forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order )Tj
T*(to perform. Pearl Jam‚Äôs efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant )Tj
T*(collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster‚Äôs monopoly. An )Tj
T*(analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative )Tj
T*(series[34][35][36][37][38][39] in a well known legal monograph[40] concluded )Tj
T*(that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster‚Äôs exclusive )Tj
T*(contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of )Tj
T*(time. The authors said, ‚ÄúThe pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive )Tj
T*(agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they )Tj
T*(are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in )Tj
T*(anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.‚Äù The United States )Tj
T*(Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and )Tj
T*(asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band )Tj
T*(members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, )Tj
T*(1994 in Washington, D.C.[41] Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used )Tj
T*(anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam‚Äôs )Tj
T*(testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell \(D-Mich.\) wrote a bill requiring )Tj
T*(full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. )Tj
T*(Pearl Jam‚Äôs manager said he was gratified that that Congress recognized the )Tj
T*(problem as a national issue.[42] The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer )Tj
T*(tour in protest.[43] After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam )Tj
T*(continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts )Tj
T*(with the company.[44] Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the )Tj
T*(Ticketmaster debacle, "the band has refused to release singles or make videos; )Tj
T*(it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more )Tj
T*(like its '60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three albums a year." He also )Tj
T*(stated that sources said that most of the band's third album Vitalogy was )Tj
T*(completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle )Tj
T*(with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay.[33] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the )Tj
T*(tracks for its next album, Vitalogy, were recorded during breaks on the tour. )Tj
T*(Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer )Tj
T*(Brendan O'Brien said, "Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being polite‚Äîthere )Tj
T*(was some imploding going on."[15] After Pearl Jam finished the recording of )Tj
T*(Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political )Tj
T*(differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese )Tj
T*(disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott.[15] He was replaced by Jack Irons, a )Tj
T*(close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the Red Hot Chili )Tj
T*(Peppers. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge School )Tj
T*(Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until )Tj
T*(its 1995 Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour long )Tj
T*(pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that )Tj
T*(wanted to carry it.[45] )Tj

T*(first week.[12]Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that "thanks to its )Tj
T*(stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original )Tj
T*(and uncompromising album."[46] Many of the songs on the album appear to be )Tj
T*(based around the pressures of fame.[47] The song "Spin the Black Circle", an )Tj
T*(homage to vinyl records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock )Tj
T*(Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs "Not for You", "Corduroy", )Tj
T*("Better Man", and "Immortality". "Better Man" \(sample \(info\)\), a song )Tj
T*(originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number )Tj
T*(one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks )Tj
T*(there. Considered a "blatantly great pop song" by producer Brendan O'Brien, )Tj
T*(Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due )Tj
T*(to its accessibility.[15] )Tj
T*( The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for )Tj
T*(Vitalogy, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in.[48] Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a )Tj
T*(few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the )Tj
T*(next three years.[49] Ament later said, "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 )Tj
T*(tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, )Tj
T*(killed our career."[15] In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the )Tj
T*(band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual )Tj
T*(obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the )Tj
T*(members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.[6] Two songs )Tj
T*(from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: "I Got Id" and "Long Road". These )Tj
T*(two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, )Tj
T*(Merkin Ball. )Tj
T*( [edit] No Code and Yield: 1996‚Äì1999 )Tj
T*( Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to )Tj
T*(record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, "Making No Code was all about )Tj
T*(gaining perspective."[50] Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate )Tj
T*(break from the band's sound since Ten,[51] favoring experimental ballads and )Tj
T*(noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that "No Code )Tj
T*(displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam album."[52] The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of )Tj
T*(self-examination,[53] with Ament stating, "In some ways, it's like the band's )Tj
T*(story. It's about growing up."[53] Although the album debuted at number one on )Tj
T*(the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the )Tj
T*(singles "Who You Are" \(¬†sample¬†\(help¬∑info\)\), "Hail, Hail", and "Off He Goes". )Tj
T*(As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of )Tj
T*(the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took )Tj
T*(place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was "a lot of stress )Tj
T*(associated with trying to tour at that time" and that "it was growing more and )Tj
T*(more difficult to be excited about being part of the band."[15] )Tj
T*( Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to )Tj
T*(record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more )Tj
T*(of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that )Tj
T*("everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of )Tj
T*(that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band."[54] On )Tj
T*(February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was )Tj
T*(cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound.[55] Tom )Tj
T*(Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has "turned in an )Tj
T*(intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, )Tj
T*(acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last )Tj
T*(alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most )Tj
T*(cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten."[56] Lyrically, Yield continued )Tj
T*(with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code,[57] with Vedder )Tj
T*(saying, "What was rage in the past has become reflection."[58]Yield debuted at )Tj
T*(number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down )Tj
T*(the charts.[59] It included the singles "Given to Fly" and "Wishlist". The band )Tj

T*(VHS and DVD later that year. )Tj
T*( In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band )Tj
T*(due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden )Tj
T*(drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis,[61] but he soon became a )Tj
T*(permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 Yield Tour in North America )Tj
T*(marked the band‚Äôs return to full-scale touring. The band's anti-trust lawsuit )Tj
T*(against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. )Tj
T*(Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use )Tj
T*(of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and )Tj
T*(impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using )Tj
T*(Ticketmaster in order to "better accommodate concertgoers."[62] The 1998 summer )Tj
T*(tour was a big success,[63] and after it was completed the band released Live )Tj
T*(on Two Legs, a live album which featured select performances from the tour. )Tj
T*( In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded "Last Kiss", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous )Tj
T*(by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was recorded during a soundcheck and )Tj
T*(released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the )Tj
T*(cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the )Tj
T*(cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds )Tj
T*(going to the aid of refugees of the Kosovo War.[12] The band also decided to )Tj
T*(include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, No Boundaries: A )Tj
T*(Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees. "Last Kiss" peaked at number two on the )Tj
T*(Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single. )Tj
T*( [edit] Binaural and the Roskilde tragedy: 2000‚Äì2001 )Tj
T*( Following its full-scale tour in support of Yield, the band took a short )Tj
T*(break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new )Tj
T*(album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, Binaural. It )Tj
T*(was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a )Tj
T*(reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several )Tj
T*(tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique.[64]Binaural )Tj
T*(was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, )Tj
T*(although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated )Tj
T*(that the band members "were ready for a change."[26]Jon Pareles of Rolling )Tj
T*(Stone said, "Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam delve elsewhere." He added, "The album reflects both Pearl Jam's )Tj
T*(longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be )Tj
T*(experimental or just plain odd."[65] The album is lyrically darker than the )Tj
T*(band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as "pretty )Tj
T*(sombre."[57]Binaural included the singles "Nothing as It Seems" \(¬†sample¬†)Tj
T*(\(help¬∑info\)\), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and "Light Years". )Tj
T*(The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio )Tj
T*(album to fail to reach platinum status.[66] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 Binaural Tour )Tj
T*(professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they )Tj
T*(attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in )Tj
T*(the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings,[67] and these )Tj
T*("official bootlegs" were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better )Tj
T*(quality product for fans.[68] Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to )Tj
T*(only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing )Tj
T*(so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through )Tj
T*(its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a )Tj
T*(record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time.[69] )Tj

T*(at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and )Tj
T*(suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests )Tj
T*(for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the )Tj
T*(crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too )Tj
T*(late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band )Tj

T*( A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg )Tj
T*(2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said )Tj
T*(that "playing, facing crowds, being together‚Äîit enabled us to start processing )Tj
T*(it."[15] On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, )Tj
T*(celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. )Tj
T*(Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band )Tj
T*(come together and make it to ten years. He noted that "I would never do this )Tj
T*(accepting a Grammy or something."[72] After concluding the Binaural Tour, the )Tj
T*(band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select )Tj
T*(performances from the North American legs of the tour. )Tj
T*( Following the events of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Vedder and )Tj
T*(McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song "Long Road" from the )Tj
T*(Merkin Ball EP at the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. The )Tj
T*(concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and )Tj
T*(their families. )Tj
T*( [edit] Riot Act: 2002‚Äì2005 )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its )Tj
T*(full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording )Tj
T*(environment as "a pretty positive one" and "very intense and spiritual."[73] )Tj
T*(Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, )Tj
T*("There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde )Tj
T*(changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world )Tj
T*(changed."[74] Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, )Tj
T*(2002. It included the singles "I Am Mine" and "Save You". The album featured a )Tj
T*(much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 )Tj
T*(organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as "Love Boat Captain". Stephen Thomas )Tj
T*(Erlewine of Allmusic said "Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been )Tj
T*(wanting to make since Vitalogy‚Äîa muscular art rock record, one that still hits )Tj
T*(hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours."[75] The track )Tj
T*(entitled "Arc" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at )Tj
T*(the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times )Tj
T*(on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.[76] )Tj
T*( In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in )Tj

T*(contractual agreement with Epic Records.[82] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; )Tj
T*(recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and )Tj
T*(released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band )Tj
T*(embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the )Tj
T*(tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician )Tj
T*(Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. )Tj
T*(After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in )Tj
T*(Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New )Tj
T*(Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. )Tj
T*(The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to )Tj
T*(raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of )Tj

T*(Latin American tour.[83] )Tj
T*( [edit] Move to J Records and Pearl Jam: 2006‚Äì2008 )Tj
T*( The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to Riot Act began after its appearance on )Tj
T*(the 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the )Tj
T*(longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its )Tj
T*(first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that )Tj
T*(Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of )Tj
T*(Sony Music Entertainment \(then known as Sony BMG\).[84] The band's eighth studio )Tj
T*(album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam as a return to the band's early sound,[85][86] and McCready compared the )Tj
T*(new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview.[87] Ament said, "The band playing in a )Tj
T*(room‚Äîthat came across. There‚Äôs a kind of immediacy to the record, and that‚Äôs )Tj
T*(what we were going for."[88] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that )Tj
T*("in a world full of boys sent to do a man's job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still )Tj
T*(pull off gravitas."[89] Current socio-political issues in the United States are )Tj
T*(addressed on the album. "World Wide Suicide", a song criticizing the Iraq War )Tj
T*(and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard )Tj
T*(Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since "Who )Tj
T*(You Are" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since )Tj
T*(1998 when "Given to Fly" reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam also included the singles "Life Wasted" and "Gone". )Tj
T*( To support Pearl Jam, the band embarked on its 2006 world tour. It toured )Tj
T*(North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the )Tj
T*(continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night )Tj
T*(stands opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.[90] The band served as the )Tj
T*(headliners for the Leeds and Reading festivals, despite having vowed to never )Tj
T*(play at a festival again after Roskilde. Vedder started both concerts with an )Tj
T*(emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the )Tj
T*(Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after )Tj
T*(Roskilde had nothing to do with "guts" but with trust in the audience.[91] )Tj
T*( In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of The Who's "Love, Reign o'er Me" for the )Tj
T*(Mike Binder film, Reign Over Me; it was later made available as a music )Tj
T*(download on the iTunes Music Store.[92] The band embarked on a 13-date European )Tj
T*(tour, and headlined Lollapalooza in Grant Park, on August 5, 2007.[93] The band )Tj
T*(released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled Live at the Gorge 05/06, that )Tj
T*(documents its shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre,[94] and in September 2007 a )Tj
T*(concert DVD, entitled Immagine in Cornice, which documents the band's Italian )Tj
T*(shows from its 2006 tour was released.[95] )Tj
T*( In June 2008, Pearl Jam performed as the headline act at the Bonnaroo Music )Tj
T*(Festival.[96] The Bonnaroo appearance took place amidst a twelve-date tour in )Tj
T*(the Eastern United States.[97] In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 )Tj
T*(tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming Lips.[98] In )Tj

T*( Pearl Jam began work for the follow-up to Pearl Jam in early 2008.[103] In )Tj

T*(1996.[citation needed] The music on the record features a sound influenced by )Tj
T*(pop and New Wave.[105]Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that "prior to )Tj
T*(Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, )Tj
T*(unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun."[106] Regarding the lyrics, )Tj
T*(Vedder said, "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I )Tj
T*(think that's going to be easier now."[107] "The Fixer" was chosen as the )Tj
T*(album's first single.[108] Pearl Jam did not re-sign its record deal with J )Tj
T*(Records, and the band released the album through its own label Monkeywrench )Tj
T*(Records in the United States and through Universal Music Group internationally. )Tj
T*(Pearl Jam reached a deal with Target to be the exclusive big-box store retailer )Tj
T*(for the album in the United States. The album also saw release through the )Tj

T*(started in June 2012.[128] )Tj
T*( [edit] Musical style and influences )Tj
T*( Compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam‚Äôs style is )Tj
T*(noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the )Tj
T*(1970s.[129] Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as )Tj
T*(influences, including The Who, Neil Young, and the Ramones.[130] Pearl Jam‚Äôs )Tj
T*(success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses "the riff-heavy stadium )Tj
T*(rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever )Tj
T*(neglecting hooks and choruses."[6] Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for )Tj
T*(its sense of beat and groove,[131] while McCready's lead guitar style, )Tj
T*(influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix,[132] has been described as )Tj
T*("feel-oriented" and "rootsy."[133] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had )Tj
T*(more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical )Tj
T*(output less catchy. He said, "I felt that with more popularity, we were going )Tj
T*(to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes."[1] By 1994‚Äôs Vitalogy, )Tj
T*(the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music.[134] The )Tj
T*(band‚Äôs 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of )Tj
T*(Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and )Tj
T*(experimentalism.[6] After 1998‚Äôs Yield, which was somewhat of a return to the )Tj
T*(straightforward rock approach of the band's early work,[55] the band dabbled )Tj
T*(with experimental art rock on 2000‚Äôs Binaural and folk rock elements on 2002‚Äôs )Tj
T*(Riot Act. The band‚Äôs 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to the band‚Äôs )Tj
T*(early sound.[85][86] The band's 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of )Tj
T*(pop and New Wave.[105] )Tj
T*( Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a "Jim Morrison-like vocal )Tj
T*(growl."[135] Greg Prato of Allmusic said, "With his hard-hitting and often )Tj
T*(confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became )Tj
T*(one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock."[136] Vedder's lyrical )Tj
T*(topics range from personal \("Alive", "Better Man"\) to social and political )Tj
T*(concerns \("Even Flow", "World Wide Suicide"\). His lyrics have often invoked the )Tj
T*(use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and )Tj
T*(sympathy for troubled individuals.[137] When the band started, Gossard and )Tj
T*(McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. )Tj
T*(The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar )Tj
T*(during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, "Even though there are three )Tj
T*(guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a )Tj
T*(two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all )Tj
T*(that."[138] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( While Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s, Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam quickly outsold them,[139] and became "the most popular American rock &amp; )Tj
T*(roll band of the '90s" according to Allmusic.[6] Pearl Jam has been described )Tj
T*(as "modern rock radio's most influential stylists¬†‚Äì the workmanlike midtempo )Tj
T*(chug of songs like "Alive" and "Even Flow" just melodic enough to get moshers )Tj
T*(singing along."[140] The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, )Tj
T*(ranging from Silverchair to Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes.[141][142] Pearl Jam )Tj
T*(has outlasted many of its contemporaries in the grunge scene such as Nirvana, )Tj
T*(Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden.[1] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its )Tj
T*(insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in )Tj
T*(the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it "proved that a )Tj
T*(rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk )Tj
T*(the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll )Tj
T*(is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll )Tj
T*(Hall of Fame."[143] Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, "The group that was )Tj
T*(once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a )Tj
T*(rock band as exists."[15] In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, Pearl Jam was )Tj
T*(voted the greatest American rock band of all time.[144] In April 2006, Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam was awarded the prize for "Best Live Act" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. )Tj

T*(The blurb called Pearl Jam "the rare superstars who still play as though each )Tj
T*(show could be their last."[145] Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared )Tj
T*(to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl )Tj
T*(Jam "toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a )Tj
T*(fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, true-believer shows )Tj
T*(in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2."[1] )Tj
T*( When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, "I think )Tj
T*(at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something )Tj
T*(to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed )Tj
T*(something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first )Tj
T*(record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue )Tj
T*(to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren‚Äôt )Tj
T*(always easy, but I think we found a way."[146] The band have also been credited )Tj
T*(for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since )Tj
T*(evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country.[147] )Tj
T*( [edit] Campaigning and activism )Tj
T*( Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political )Tj
T*(issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's )Tj
T*(presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has )Tj
T*(promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn's disease, which Mike )Tj
T*(McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment )Tj
T*(and wildlife protection, among others.[148][149] Guitarist Stone Gossard has )Tj
T*(been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's )Tj
T*(carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact.[150] Vedder )Tj
T*(has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien )Tj
T*(Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song "Army )Tj
T*(Reserve" \(from Pearl Jam\).[151] )Tj
T*( The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of )Tj
T*(the pro-choice movement. In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled )Tj
T*("Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion.[152] In an MTV Unplugged )Tj
T*(concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote "PRO-CHOICE!" on his )Tj
T*(arm in protest when the band performed the song "Porch".[15] The band are )Tj
T*(members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and )Tj
T*(Voters for Choice.[149] )Tj
T*( As members of Rock the Vote and Vote for Change, the band has encouraged voter )Tj
T*(registration and participation in United States elections. Vedder was outspoken )Tj
T*(in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000,[153] and )Tj
T*(Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October )Tj
T*(2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. President. In a Rolling )Tj
T*(Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the )Tj
T*(magazine, "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have )Tj
T*(to get a new administration in."[154] )Tj
T*( Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. )Tj
T*(foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including "Bu$hleaguer" and "World )Tj
T*(Wide Suicide", are openly critical of the Bush administration. At Lollapalooza )Tj
T*(2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan,[155] )Tj
T*(and at the end of "Daughter", he sang the lyrics "George Bush leave this world )Tj
T*(alone/George Bush find yourself another home". In the beginning of the second )Tj
T*(encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the )Tj
T*(documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in )Tj
T*(turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to "No More" and "Rockin' in )Tj
T*(the Free World".[156] The band has since discovered that some of the )Tj
T*(Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&amp;T webcast of the event, and )Tj
T*(are questioning whether that constitutes censorship.[157] AT&amp;T later )Tj
T*(apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown )Tj
T*(Entertainment.[158] )Tj
T*( Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For )Tj
T*(example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United )Tj
T*(Nations' efforts to combat world hunger.[159] The band added a date at the )Tj
T*(Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of Hurricane )Tj

T*(nucleus: the number of protons determines the chemical element, and the number )Tj
T*(of neutrons determines the isotope of the element.[1] )Tj
T*( Chemical atoms, which in science now carry the simple name of "atom," are )Tj
T*(minuscule objects with diameters of a few tenths of a nanometer and tiny masses )Tj
T*(proportional to the volume implied by these dimensions. Atoms can only be )Tj
T*(observed individually using special instruments such as the scanning tunneling )Tj
T*(microscope. Over 99.94% of an atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus,[note )Tj
T*(1] with protons and neutrons having roughly equal mass. Each element has at )Tj
T*(least one isotope with an unstable nucleus that can undergo radioactive decay. )Tj
T*(This can result in a transmutation that changes the number of protons or )Tj
T*(neutrons in a nucleus.[2] Electrons that are bound to atoms possess a set of )Tj
T*(stable energy levels, or orbitals, and can undergo transitions between them by )Tj
T*(absorbing or emitting photons that match the energy differences between the )Tj
T*(levels. The electrons determine the chemical properties of an element, and )Tj
T*(strongly influence an atom's magnetic properties. The principles of quantum )Tj
T*(mechanics have been successfully used to model the observed properties of the )Tj
T*(atom. )Tj
T*( Etymology )Tj
T*( The name atom comes from the Greek ·ºÑœÑŒøŒºŒøœÇ \(atomos, "indivisible"\) from ·ºÄ- \(a-, )Tj
T*("not"\) and œÑŒ≠ŒºŒΩœâ \(temn≈ç, "I cut"\),[3] which means uncuttable, or indivisible, )Tj
T*(something that cannot be divided further.[4] The concept of an atom as an )Tj
T*(indivisible component of matter was first proposed by early Indian and Greek )Tj
T*(philosophers. In the 18th and 19th centuries, chemists provided a physical )Tj
T*(basis for this idea by showing that certain substances could not be further )Tj
T*(broken down by chemical methods, and they applied the ancient philosophical )Tj
T*(name of atom to the chemical entity. During the late 19th and early 20th )Tj
T*(centuries, physicists discovered subatomic components and structure inside the )Tj
T*(atom, thereby demonstrating that the chemical "atom" was divisible and that the )Tj
T*(name might not be appropriate.[5]. However, it was retained. This has led to )Tj
T*(some debate about whether the ancient philosophers, who intended to refer to )Tj
T*(fundamental individual objects with their concept of "atoms," were referring to )Tj
T*(modern chemical atoms, or something more like indivisible subatomic particles )Tj
T*(such as leptons or quarks, or even some more fundamental particle that has yet )Tj
T*(to be discovered.[7] )Tj
T*( History )Tj
T*( Main article: Atomic theory )Tj
T*( Atomism )Tj
T*( The concept that matter is composed of discrete units and cannot be divided )Tj
T*(into arbitrarily tiny quantities has been around for millennia, but these ideas )Tj
T*(were founded in abstract, philosophical reasoning rather than experimentation )Tj
T*(and empirical observation. The nature of atoms in philosophy varied )Tj
T*(considerably over time and between cultures and schools, and often had )Tj
T*(spiritual elements. Nevertheless, the basic idea of the atom was adopted by )Tj
T*(scientists thousands of years later because it elegantly explained new )Tj
T*(discoveries in the field of chemistry. )Tj
T*( References to the concept of atoms date back to ancient Greece and India. In )Tj
T*(India, the ƒÄjƒ´vika, Jain, and CƒÅrvƒÅka schools of atomism may date back to the )Tj
T*(6th century BCE. The Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools later developed theories on )Tj
T*(how atoms combined into more complex objects. In the West, the references to )Tj
T*(atoms emerged in the 5th century BCE with Leucippus, whose student, Democritus, )Tj
T*(systematized his views. In approximately 450¬†BCE, Democritus coined the term )Tj
T*(√°tomos \(Greek: ·ºÑœÑŒøŒºŒøœÇ\), which means "uncuttable" or "the smallest indivisible )Tj
T*(particle of matter". Although the Indian and Greek concepts of the atom were )Tj
T*(based purely on philosophy, modern science has retained the name coined by )Tj
T*(Democritus. )Tj
T*( Corpuscularianism is the postulate, expounded in the 13th-century by the )Tj
T*(alchemist Pseudo-Geber \(Geber\), sometimes identified with Paul of Taranto, that )Tj
T*(all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or )Tj
T*(corpuscles. Corpuscularianism is similar to the theory of atomism, except that )Tj
T*(where atoms were supposed to be indivisible, corpuscles could in principle be )Tj

T*(divided. In this manner, for example, it was theorized that mercury could )Tj
T*(penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure.[13] Corpuscularianism )Tj
T*(stayed a dominant theory over the next several hundred years. )Tj
T*( In 1661, natural philosopher Robert Boyle published The Sceptical Chymist in )Tj
T*(which he argued that matter was composed of various combinations of different )Tj
T*("corpuscules" or atoms, rather than the classical elements of air, earth, fire )Tj
T*(and water. During the 1670s corpuscularianism was used by Isaac Newton in his )Tj
T*(development of the corpuscular theory of light.[15] )Tj
T*( Origin of scientific theory )Tj
T*( Further progress in the understanding of atoms did not occur until the science )Tj
T*(of chemistry began to develop. In 1789, French nobleman and scientific )Tj
T*(researcher Antoine Lavoisier discovered the law of conservation of mass and )Tj
T*(defined an element as a basic substance that could not be further broken down )Tj
T*(by the methods of chemistry.[16] )Tj
T*( In 1805, English instructor and natural philosopher John Dalton used the )Tj
T*(concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole )Tj
T*(numbers \(the law of multiple proportions\) and why certain gases dissolved )Tj
T*(better in water than others. He proposed that each element consists of atoms of )Tj
T*(a single, unique type, and that these atoms can join together to form chemical )Tj
T*(compounds. Dalton is considered the originator of modern atomic theory. )Tj
T*( Dalton's atomic hypothesis did not specify the size of atoms. Common sense )Tj
T*(indicated they must be very small, but nobody knew how small. Therefore it was )Tj
T*(a major landmark when in 1865 Johann Josef Loschmidt measured the size of the )Tj
T*(molecules that make up air. )Tj
T*( An additional line of reasoning in support of particle theory \(and by )Tj
T*(extension atomic theory\) began in 1827 when botanist Robert Brown used a )Tj
T*(microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they )Tj
T*(moved about erratically‚Äîa phenomenon that became known as "Brownian motion". J. )Tj
T*(Desaulx suggested in 1877 that the phenomenon was caused by the thermal motion )Tj
T*(of water molecules, and in 1905 Albert Einstein produced the first mathematical )Tj
T*(analysis of the motion.[20][22] French physicist Jean Perrin used Einstein's )Tj
T*(work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby )Tj
T*(conclusively verifying Dalton's atomic theory.[23] )Tj
T*( In 1869, building upon earlier discoveries by such scientists as Lavoisier, )Tj
T*(Dmitri Mendeleev published the first functional periodic table.[24] The table )Tj
T*(itself is a visual representation of the periodic law, which states that )Tj
T*(certain chemical properties of elements repeat periodically when arranged by )Tj
T*(atomic number. )Tj
T*( Subcomponents and quantum theory )Tj
T*( The physicist J. J. Thomson, through his work on cathode rays in 1897, )Tj
T*(discovered the electron, and concluded that they were a component of every )Tj
T*(atom. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate )Tj
T*(particles of matter.[26] Thomson postulated that the low mass, negatively )Tj
T*(charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom, possibly rotating in )Tj
T*(rings, with their charge balanced by the presence of a uniform sea of positive )Tj
T*(charge. This later became known as the plum pudding model. )Tj
T*( In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the direction of physicist )Tj
T*(Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a sheet of gold foil with alpha rays‚Äîby then known )Tj
T*(to be positively charged helium atoms‚Äîand discovered that a small percentage of )Tj
T*(these particles were deflected through much larger angles than was predicted )Tj
T*(using Thomson's proposal. Rutherford interpreted the gold foil experiment as )Tj
T*(suggesting that the positive charge of a heavy gold atom and most of its mass )Tj
T*(was concentrated in a nucleus at the center of the atom‚Äîthe Rutherford )Tj
T*(model.[27] )Tj
T*( While experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913 )Tj
T*(radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one )Tj
T*(type of atom at each position on the periodic table.[28] The term isotope was )Tj
T*(coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to )Tj
T*(the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types )Tj
T*(through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of )Tj

T*( Meanwhile, in 1913, physicist Niels Bohr suggested that the electrons were )Tj
T*(confined into clearly defined, quantized orbits, and could jump between these, )Tj
T*(but could not freely spiral inward or outward in intermediate states.[30] An )Tj
T*(electron must absorb or emit specific amounts of energy to transition between )Tj
T*(these fixed orbits. When the light from a heated material was passed through a )Tj
T*(prism, it produced a multi-colored spectrum. The appearance of fixed lines in )Tj
T*(this spectrum was successfully explained by these orbital transitions.[31] )Tj

T*( Energy levels )Tj
T*( The potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of )Tj
T*(its position reaches the minimum \(the most absolute value\) inside the nucleus, )Tj
T*(and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an )Tj
T*(inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound )Tj
T*(electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each )Tj
T*(state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schr√∂dinger )Tj
T*(equation for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the )Tj
T*(amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually )Tj
T*(given in units of electronvolts \(eV\). The lowest energy state of a bound )Tj
T*(electron is called the ground state,[clarification needed] while an electron )Tj
T*(transition to a higher level results in an excited state.[94] The electron's )Tj
T*(energy raises when n increases because the \(average\) distance to the nucleus )Tj
T*(increases. Dependence of the energy on¬†‚Ñì is caused not by electrostatic )Tj
T*(potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons. )Tj
T*( For an electron to transition between two different states, it must[citation )Tj
T*(needed] absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching the difference in the )Tj
T*(potential energy of those levels. The energy of an emitted photon is )Tj
T*(proportional to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as )Tj
T*(distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.[95] Each element has a )Tj
T*(characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled )Tj
T*(by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other )Tj
T*(factors.[96] )Tj
T*( When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some )Tj
T*(of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy )Tj
T*(level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously )Tj
T*(emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back )Tj
T*(to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series )Tj
T*(of dark absorption bands in the energy output. \(An observer viewing the atoms )Tj
T*(from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, )Tj
T*(instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.\) )Tj
T*(Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines )Tj
T*(allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be )Tj
T*(determined.[97] )Tj
T*( Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine )Tj
T*(structure splitting. This occurs because of spin‚Äìorbit coupling, which is an )Tj
T*(interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.[98] When an )Tj
T*(atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three )Tj
T*(or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This is caused by )Tj
T*(the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and )Tj
T*(its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the )Tj
T*(same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction )Tj
T*(of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to )Tj
T*(slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.[99] The )Tj
T*(presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and )Tj
T*(shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a )Tj
T*(phenomenon called the Stark effect. )Tj
T*( If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the )Tj
T*(proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy )Tj
T*(level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that )Tj
T*(has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The )Tj
T*(emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with )Tj
T*(matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are )Tj
T*(synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a )Tj
T*(coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.[101] )Tj
T*( Valence and bonding behavior )Tj
T*( The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as )Tj

T*(one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound sodium )Tj

T*(Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone. )Tj
T*( At temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a Bose‚ÄìEinstein )Tj

T*( Identification )Tj

T*(local density of states.[111][112] )Tj
T*( An atom can be ionized by removing one of its electrons. The electric charge )Tj
T*(causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic )Tj

T*(magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer )Tj

T*(Believed to stand on the site of an earlier building, about which little is )Tj
T*(known, the current house is one of the oldest surviving English brick houses. )Tj
T*(It was remodelled in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. )Tj
T*( The house has been home to Sir William Compton, the Barons Coleraine and Sir )Tj
T*(Rowland Hill, among others. After serving as a school during the 19th century, )Tj
T*(when a large extension was built to the west, it was converted into a museum )Tj
T*(exploring the history of the areas which constitute the present London Borough )Tj
T*(of Haringey and, on the strength of its connection with Sir Rowland Hill, the )Tj
T*(history of the Royal Mail. The building also houses the archives of the London )Tj
T*(Borough of Haringey. Since 1892 the grounds have been a public park, )Tj
T*(Tottenham's oldest. )Tj
T*( [edit] Origins of the name )Tj
T*( The name Bruce Castle is derived from the House of Bruce, who had historically )Tj
T*(owned a third of the manor of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the )Tj
T*(area, and it is unlikely that the family lived nearby.[3] Upon his accession to )Tj
T*(the Scottish throne in 1306, Robert I of Scotland forfeited his lands in )Tj
T*(England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham,[3] ending the connection )Tj
T*(between the Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was )Tj
T*(granted to Richard Spigurnell and Thomas Hethe.[4] )Tj
T*( The three parts of the manor of Tottenham were united in the early 15th )Tj
T*(century under the Gedeney family and have remained united since.[4] In all )Tj
T*(early records, the building is referred to as the Lordship House. The name )Tj
T*(Bruce Castle first appears to have been adopted by Henry Hare, 2nd Baron )Tj
T*(Coleraine \(1635‚Äì1708\),[3] although Daniel Lysons speculates in The Environs of )Tj
T*(London \(1795\) that the usage of the name dates to the late 13th century.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Architecture )Tj
T*( A detached, cylindrical Tudor tower stands immediately to the southeast of the )Tj
T*(house, and is generally considered to be the earliest part of the building;[5] )Tj
T*(however, Lysons believes it to have been a later addition.[4] The tower is )Tj
T*(built of local red brick, and is 21 feet \(6.4¬†m\) tall, with walls 3 feet \(0.91¬†)Tj
T*(m\) thick.[5] In 2006, excavations revealed that it continues for some distance )Tj
T*(below the current ground level.[6] It was described in 1829 as being over a )Tj
T*(deep well, and being used as a dairy.[7] )Tj
T*( Sources disagree on the house's initial construction date, and no records )Tj
T*(survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating parts )Tj
T*(of the building to the 15th century;[5] William Robinson's History and )Tj
T*(Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham \(1840\) suggests a date of about 1514,[8] )Tj
T*(although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late )Tj
T*(16th century. Nikolaus Pevsner speculates that the front may have formed part )Tj
T*(of a courtyard house of which the remainder has disappeared.[9] )Tj
T*( The principal facade of the Grade I mansion has been substantially remodelled )Tj
T*(over time. The house is constructed of red brick with ashlar quoining and the )Tj
T*(principal facade, terminated by symmetrical matching bays, has tall paned )Tj
T*(windows. The house and detached tower are among the earliest uses of brick as )Tj
T*(the principal building material for an English house.[10] )Tj
T*( Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine \(1635‚Äì1708\) oversaw a substantial remodelling )Tj
T*(of the house in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that )Tj
T*(time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with )Tj
T*(stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola.[9] )Tj
T*(A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the centre of the house, with service rooms )Tj
T*(to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining )Tj
T*(room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's )Tj
T*(chamber over the porch.[9] )Tj
T*( In the early 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine \(1694‚Äì1749\) oversaw )Tj
T*(a remodelling of the north of the house, in which an extra range of rooms was )Tj
T*(added to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms added to the pediment of the )Tj
T*(north facade.[9] In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James )Tj
T*(Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance )Tj
T*(front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, )Tj
T*(the gabled attics on the south front were removed, giving the southern )Tj

T*(made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, )Tj
T*(dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and )Tj
T*(billiard room on the first floor.[9] )Tj
T*( In the early 19th century the west wing of the house was demolished, leaving )Tj
T*(it with the asymmetrical appearance that it retains today.[11] The house was )Tj
T*(converted into a school, and in 1870 a three-story extension was built in the )Tj
T*(Gothic Revival style to the northwest of the house.[9] )Tj
T*( The 2006 excavations by the Museum of London uncovered the chalk foundations )Tj
T*(of an earlier building on the site, of which nothing is currently )Tj
T*(known.[6]Court rolls of 1742 refer to the repair of a drawbridge, implying that )Tj
T*(the building then had a moat.[5] A 1911 archaeological journal made passing )Tj
T*(reference to "the recent levelling of the moat".[12]  )Tj
T*( [edit] Early residents )Tj
T*( It is generally believed that the first owner of the house was Sir William )Tj
T*(Compton, Groom of the Stool to Henry VIII and one of the most prominent )Tj
T*(courtiers of the period, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514.[5] )Tj
T*(However, there is no recorded evidence of Compton's living in the house, and )Tj
T*(there is some evidence that the current building dates to a later period.[5] )Tj
T*( The earliest known reference to the building dates from 1516, when Henry VIII )Tj
T*(met his sister Margaret, Queen of Scots, at "Maister Compton's House beside )Tj
T*(Tottenham".[8] The Comptons owned the building throughout the 16th century, but )Tj
T*(few records of the family or the building survive from the period.[14] )Tj
T*( In the early 17th century the house was owned by Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl )Tj
T*(of Dorset and Lady Anne Clifford. Sackville ran up high debts through gambling )Tj
T*(and extravagant spending; the house \(then still called "The Lordship House"\) )Tj
T*(was leased to Thomas Peniston. Peniston's wife, Martha, daughter of Sir Thomas )Tj
T*(Temple was said to be the Earl of Dorset's mistress.[15] The house was later )Tj
T*(sold to wealthy Norfolk landowner Hugh Hare.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] 17th century: the Hare family )Tj
T*( [edit] Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine )Tj
T*( Hugh Hare \(1606‚Äì1667\) had inherited a large amount of money from his )Tj
T*(great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, )Tj
T*(his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the )Tj
T*(young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married )Tj
T*(Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, )Tj
T*(including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine )Tj
T*(shortly thereafter.[16] )Tj
T*( As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went )Tj
T*(into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house )Tj
T*(in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the )Tj
T*(Restoration in a severe state of disrepair.[16] Records of Tottenham from the )Tj
T*(period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House )Tj
T*(during the Commonwealth of England are unknown.[16] Hugh Hare died at his home )Tj
T*(in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey whilst )Tj
T*(laughing and drinking,[16] and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron )Tj
T*(Coleraine. )Tj
T*( [edit] Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine )Tj
T*( Henry Hare \(1635‚Äì1708\) settled at the Lordship House, renaming it Bruce Castle )Tj
T*(in honour of the area's historic connection with the House of Bruce.[3] Hare )Tj
T*(was a noted historian and author of the first history of Tottenham. He grew up )Tj
T*(at the Hare family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to )Tj
T*(Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the )Tj
T*(family were still living in Totteridge, while by the time of the death of his )Tj
T*(first wife Constantia, in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle. )Tj
T*(According to Hare, Constantia was buried in All Hallows Church in Tottenham. )Tj
T*(However, the parish register for the period is complete and makes no mention of )Tj
T*(her death or burial.[17] )Tj
T*( Following the death of Constantia, Hare married Sarah Alston. They had been )Tj

T*( The house was substantially remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's )Tj
T*(marriage to the dowager Duchess of Somerset, and much of the existing south )Tj
T*(facade dates from this time.[9] The facade's dominating feature is a central )Tj

T*( [edit] The Ghostly Lady of Bruce Castle )Tj
T*( Although sources such as Pegram speculate that Constantia committed suicide in )Tj
T*(the face of a continued relationship between Hare and the Duchess of )Tj
T*(Somerset,[18] little is known about her life and the circumstances of her early )Tj
T*(death, and her ghost reputedly haunts the castle.[19] )Tj
T*( The earliest recorded reference to the ghost appeared in 1858 ‚Äì almost two )Tj
T*(hundred years after her death ‚Äì in the Tottenham &amp; Edmonton Advertiser. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(A lady of our acquaintance was introduced at a party to an Indian Officer who, )Tj
T*(hearing that she came from Tottenham, eagerly asked if she had seen the Ghostly )Tj
T*(Lady of Bruce Castle. Some years before he had been told the following story by )Tj
T*(a brother officer when encamped on a march in India. One of the Lords Coleraine )Tj
T*(had married a beautiful lady and while she was yet in her youth had been seized )Tj
T*(with a violent hatred against her ‚Äì whether from jealousy or not is not known. )Tj
T*(He first confined her to the upper part of the house and subsequently still )Tj
T*(more closely to the little rooms of the clock turret. These rooms looked on the )Tj
T*(balconies: the lady one night succeeded in forcing her way out and flung )Tj
T*(herself with child in arms from the parapet. The wild despairing shriek aroused )Tj
T*(the household only to find her and her infant in death's clutches below. Every )Tj
T*(year as the fearful night comes round \(it is in November\) the wild form can be )Tj
T*(seen as she stood on the fatal parapet, and her despairing cry is heard )Tj
T*(floating away on the autumnal blast.[17][20])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The legend has now been largely forgotten, and there have been no reported )Tj
T*(sightings of the ghost in recent times.[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Residents in the 18th century )Tj
T*( Sarah Hare died in 1692 and was buried in Westminster Abbey,[18] and Hare in )Tj
T*(1708, to be succeeded by his grandson Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine. Henry )Tj
T*(Hare was a leading antiquary, residing only briefly at Bruce Castle between )Tj
T*(lengthy tours of Europe. )Tj
T*( The house was remodelled again under the 3rd Baron Coleraine's ownership. An )Tj
T*(extra range of rooms was added to the north, and the pediment of the north )Tj
T*(front ornamented with a large coat of the Coleraine arms.[9] )Tj
T*( Hare's marriage was not consummated, and following an affair with a French )Tj
T*(woman, Rosa du Plessis, du Plessis bore him his only child, a daughter named )Tj
T*(Henrietta Rosa Peregrina, born in France in 1745.[21] Hare died in 1749 leaving )Tj
T*(his estates to the four-year-old Henrietta, but her claim was rejected owing to )Tj
T*(her French nationality. After many years of legal challenges, the estates, )Tj
T*(including Bruce Castle, were granted to her husband James Townsend, whom she )Tj
T*(had married at age 18.[21] )Tj
T*( James Townsend was a leading citizen of the day. He served as a magistrate, )Tj
T*(was Member of Parliament for West Looe, and in 1772 became Lord Mayor of )Tj
T*(London, whilst Henrietta was a prominent artist, many of whose engravings of )Tj
T*(18th-century Tottenham survive in the Bruce Castle Museum.[21] )Tj
T*( After 1764, under the ownership of James Townsend, the house was remodelled )Tj
T*(again. The narrow east front was remodelled into an entrance front, and given )Tj
T*(the appearance of a typical Georgian house, while the gabled attics on the )Tj
T*(south front were removed, giving the south facade the appearance it has )Tj

T*( James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, showed little )Tj
T*(interest in the area or in the traditional role of the Lord of the Manor. After )Tj
T*(leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold )Tj
T*(in 1792 to Thomas Smith of Gray's Inn as a country residence.[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] John Eardley Wilmot )Tj
T*( John Eardley Wilmot \(c.¬†1749 ‚Äì 23 June 1815\) was Member of Parliament for )Tj
T*(Tiverton \(1776‚Äì1784\) and Coventry \(1784‚Äì1796\), and in 1783 led the )Tj
T*(Parliamentary Commission investigating the events that had led to the American )Tj
T*(Revolution. He also led the processing of compensation claims, and the supply )Tj
T*(of basic housing and provisions, for the 60,000¬†Loyalist refugees who arrived )Tj
T*(in England in the aftermath of the independence of the United States.[11] )Tj
T*( Following the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, a second wave of )Tj
T*(refugees arrived in England. Although the British government on this occasion )Tj
T*(did not offer organised relief to refugees, Wilmot, in association with William )Tj
T*(Wilberforce, Edmund Burke and George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of )Tj
T*(Buckingham, founded "Wilmot's Committee", which raised funds to provide )Tj
T*(accommodation and food, and found employment for refugees from France, large )Tj
T*(numbers of whom settled in the Tottenham area.[11] )Tj
T*( In 1804, Wilmot retired from public life and moved to Bruce Castle to write )Tj
T*(his memoirs of the American Revolution, and his role in the investigations of )Tj
T*(its causes and consequences. They were published shortly before his death in )Tj
T*(1815.[11] )Tj
T*( After Wilmot's death London merchant John Ede purchased the house and its )Tj
T*(grounds, and demolished the building's west wing.[11] It was never rebuilt, )Tj
T*(resulting in the current skewed shape of the building. In 1827, Ede sold the )Tj
T*(house and grounds to Worcestershire educationalist Rowland Hill, for use as a )Tj
T*(school. )Tj
T*( [edit] The Hill School )Tj
T*( Hill and his brothers had taken over the management of their father's school )Tj
T*(in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with )Tj
T*(Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by )Tj
T*(Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley;[22] all )Tj
T*(teaching was on the principle that the role of the teacher is to instill the )Tj
T*(desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and )Tj
T*(alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught )Tj
T*(a radical \(for the time\) curriculum including foreign languages, science and )Tj
T*(engineering.[23][24] Amongst other pupils, the school taught the sons of many )Tj
T*(London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of )Tj
T*(South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.[23] )Tj
T*( In 1839 Rowland Hill, who had written an influential proposal on postal )Tj
T*(reform, was appointed as head of the General Post Office \(where he introduced )Tj
T*(the world's first postage stamps\), leaving the school in the hands of his )Tj
T*(younger brother Arthur Hill.[23] Arthur retired in 1868, leaving the school in )Tj
T*(the hands of his son Birkbeck Hill. )Tj
T*( During the period of the School's operation, the character of the area had )Tj
T*(changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four )Tj
T*(villages on Ermine Street \(later the A10 road\), surrounded by marshland and )Tj
T*(farmland.[25] The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840, )Tj
T*(with stations at Tottenham Hale and Marsh Lane \(later Northumberland Park\), )Tj
T*(made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time )Tj
T*(\(albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via Stratford, more than double the )Tj
T*(distance of the direct road route\), as well as providing direct connections to )Tj
T*(the Port of London.[26] In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a direct line )Tj
T*(from Enfield to Liverpool Street station,[27] including a station at Bruce )Tj
T*(Grove, close to Bruce Castle;[28] the railway provided subsidised workmen's )Tj
T*(fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in )Tj
T*(central London.[29] As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant )Tj
T*(residential and industrial area; by the end of the 19th century, the only )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( ^ Sources differ as to the date of construction; some date the current )Tj
T*(building to the 15th century, but most agree that the house dates from the 16th )Tj
T*(century, although there is no consensus as to the exact date.)Tj
T*(^ As with most other English maps of the period, the map is aligned with south )Tj
T*(at the top \(i.e. "upside down" when compared to modern maps\). The alignment of )Tj
T*(streets in the area is preserved today; the road running east-west is the )Tj

T*(the present-day Church Lane; Bruce Grove does not yet exist, but its eventual )Tj
T*(route can be seen in the field boundaries running diagonally immediately south )Tj
T*(of the castle. The large field opposite the house \(marked "Lease"\) is the )Tj
T*(northeast corner of the water-meadow which became Broadwater Farm. The fields )Tj

T*(sensation. The song was an unofficial anthem for Chinese youth and activists )Tj
T*(during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. )Tj
T*( Both in its lyrics and instruments, the song mixes traditional Chinese styles )Tj
T*(with modern rock elements. In the lyrics, the speaker addresses a girl who is )Tj
T*(scorning him because he has nothing. However, the song has also been )Tj
T*(interpreted as being about the dispossessed youth of the time, because it )Tj
T*(evokes a sense of disillusionment and lack of individual freedom that was )Tj
T*(common among the young generation during the 1980s. )Tj
T*( [edit] Historical context )Tj
T*( By the late 1970s, Western rock music was gaining popularity in mainland )Tj
T*(China. After the Cultural Revolution ended in the mid-1970s and the government )Tj
T*(began a period of economic reform called gaige kaifang, many students and )Tj
T*(businessmen went abroad and brought back Western music. Chinese singers began )Tj
T*(performing covers of popular Western rock songs.[1] )Tj
T*( At the same time, Chinese society and the Chinese government were quickly )Tj
T*(abandoning Maoism, and promoting economic policies that had a more capitalist )Tj
T*(orientation.[2] Many Chinese teens and students were becoming disillusioned )Tj
T*(with their government, which they felt had abandoned its ideals.[3] Because of )Tj
T*(the rapid economic changes, many of them felt that they had no opportunities )Tj
T*(and no individual freedom.[4] These developments formed the background against )Tj
T*(which "Nothing to My Name" appeared in 1986. )Tj
T*( [edit] Music and lyrics )Tj
T*( [edit] Musical style )Tj
T*( Cui Jian was heavily influenced by Western artists such as Bob Dylan, The )Tj
T*(Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Talking Heads;[5] in the late 1980s he even )Tj
T*(performed with a hair style modeled on that of John Lennon.[6] In "Nothing to )Tj
T*(My Name" and other songs, he intentionally altered the sounds of traditional )Tj
T*(Chinese musical instruments by mixing them with elements of rock music, such as )Tj
T*(electric guitar.[7] He also purposely divorced his musical style from that of )Tj
T*(the revolutionary songs and proletarian operas that were common under Chairman )Tj
T*(Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution‚Äîfor example, he performed his music )Tj
T*(very loud, as high as 150¬†decibels, just because Mao had considered loud music )Tj
T*(disruptive to the social order.[8] )Tj
T*( In genre, the song is often called the first work of Xibeifeng, a 1980s music )Tj
T*(style originating from Northwest China.[9] Cui himself, however, considers the )Tj
T*(song "pure" rock and roll.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Lyrics and meaning )Tj
T*( Throughout the song, the narrator addresses an unidentified girl, asking "When )Tj
T*(will you come with me", and lamenting the fact that she laughs at him for )Tj
T*(having nothing to his name.[11] He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and )Tj
T*(bring her freedom, that "the earth is turning under your feet" and "the waters )Tj
T*(of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him.[11] He asks why )Tj
T*(she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on )Tj
T*(going, with nothing to his name.[11] At last, he tells her that he has waited )Tj
T*(for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the )Tj
T*(hands, to "take you away with me".[11] As he sees her hands tremble, and her )Tj
T*(eyes "overflow with tears", he asks her, "Do you really mean to tell me, you )Tj
T*(love me as I am?"[11] )Tj
T*( Interpretations of the song's meaning vary from one listener to the next; some )Tj
T*(people view it as a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a )Tj
T*(political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as )Tj
T*(to a girlfriend.[12][13][14][15]University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz )Tj
T*(describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive )Tj
T*(ideas that could not be stated through any other medium.[16] In this )Tj
T*(interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, "I've asked you without end / )Tj
T*(When will you go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to )Tj
T*(my name" \("ÊàëÊõæÁªèÈóÆ‰∏™‰∏ç‰ºë/‰Ω†‰ΩïÊó∂Ë∑üÊàëËµ∞/ÂèØ‰Ω†Âç¥ÊÄªÊòØÁ¨ëÊàë/‰∏ÄÊó†ÊâÄÊúâ"\) are taken to )Tj
T*(express the "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal )Tj
T*(freedom",[11] the "sense of loss and disorientation" among China's youth in the )Tj
T*(1980s.[17] Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis )Tj

T*(of the song lyrics as "recast[ing] the setting of this piece from that of a boy )Tj
T*(talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the )Tj
T*(nation as a whole." The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase )Tj
T*(yƒ´ w√∫ su≈è y≈èu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means "to have nothing" and )Tj
T*(has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning "I have )Tj
T*(nothing" \(implying that it is a song about two people\), or "we have nothing" )Tj
T*(\(understanding it as social commentary\).[18][19] )Tj
T*( The narrator of the song worries that the girl he is addressing will ignore )Tj
T*(him because he has nothing to give her; likewise, the song's audience in the )Tj
T*(1980s‚Äîyoung students and workers‚Äîwere also suffering from not having resources )Tj
T*(to marry, to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of )Tj
T*(the opposite sex.[4] The lyrics also express Western concepts of )Tj
T*(individualism,[20] and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to )Tj
T*(promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark )Tj
T*(contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience.[3] As )Tj
T*(the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he )Tj
T*(will "grab her hands" \("ÊàëË¶ÅÊäìËµ∑‰Ω†ÁöÑÂèåÊâã"\) and then she will go with him )Tj
T*(\("‰Ω†ËøôÂ∞±Ë∑üÊàëËµ∞"\), he suggests in the end that she can love the fact that he has )Tj
T*(nothing \("Ëé´Èùû‰Ω†ÊòØÊ≠£Âú®ÂëäËØâÊàë/‰Ω†Áà±Êàë‰∏ÄÊó†ÊâÄÊúâ"\). On one level, this suggests that )Tj
T*(the song is about "love conquering all",[21] but the line has also been )Tj
T*(interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and "Dionysian" mix )Tj
T*(of love and aggression.[22] )Tj
T*( Just as Cui adapts traditional Chinese sounds and instruments to a new format, )Tj
T*(in "Nothing to My Name" he also reappropriates traditional Chinese lyrical )Tj
T*(tropes. The lines "The earth under your feet is moving / The water around your )Tj
T*(body is flowing" \("ËÑö‰∏ãÁöÑÂú∞Âú®Ëµ∞/Ë∫´ËæπÁöÑÊ∞¥Âú®ÊµÅ"\) are reminiscent of the use of )Tj
T*(natural imagery in classical Chinese poetry and music, but here are intended to )Tj
T*(evoke the events going on around the song's listeners, and to provoke them to )Tj
T*(rebel against the established order.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Release and impact )Tj
T*( Cui wrote "Nothing to My Name" himself[9] and first performed it on a )Tj
T*(televised music competition in May 1986, with his band ADO.[5][12][21] The song )Tj
T*(was an instant success, creating a "sensation" and turning Cui into a cult )Tj
T*(figure among urban youth.[24][25] It was one of the first examples of Chinese, )Tj
T*(as opposed to imported, rock and roll music to gain popularity in )Tj
T*(China.[20][26] The government-controlled People's Daily gave the song a )Tj
T*(positive review, despite its politically sensitive message.[27] The song was )Tj
T*(included on Cui's 1989 album Rock 'n' Roll on the New Long March, released by )Tj
T*(the China Tourism Sound and Video Publishing Company. \(The version of the album )Tj
T*(released overseas was called Nothing to My Name.[28]\) By 1989, it had become a )Tj
T*("battle song"[5] or "anthem"[29] among the youth movement.[12][30] )Tj
T*( Cui performed the song live at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[5][31] )Tj
T*(The performances by Cui and other rock artists during the protests have been )Tj
T*(described as "a revolutionary few days that rocked a nation," and many )Tj
T*(protesters sang "Nothing to My Name" to give voice to their rebellion against )Tj
T*(the government, and their desire for personal freedom and )Tj
T*(self-expression.[3][32] Brace describes how, during Cui's Tiananmen )Tj
T*(performance, students "jumped to their feet and began to sing," a practice that )Tj
T*(had rarely happened at music performances in China before then.[33] Not long )Tj
T*(after Tiananmen, Cui was restricted to playing in small venues; he did not play )Tj
T*(before a large audience in mainland China again until 2005.[12] )Tj
T*( Cui has become known as the "Father of Chinese Rock",[34] and "Nothing to My )Tj
T*(Name" has become his most famous song.[21][35] It has been described as "the )Tj
T*(biggest hit in Chinese history"[5][36] and the beginning of Chinese rock.[26] )Tj

T*( She was raised at the Gatchina Palace outside Saint Petersburg. Olga's )Tj
T*(relationship with her mother, Empress Marie, the daughter of King Christian IX )Tj
T*(of Denmark, was strained and distant from childhood. In contrast, she and her )Tj
T*(father were close. He died when she was 12, and her brother Nicholas became )Tj
T*(emperor. )Tj
T*( In 1901, she married Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately )Tj
T*(believed by family and friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years )Tj
T*(remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a )Tj
T*(divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually )Tj
T*(annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married )Tj
T*(cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, with whom she had fallen in love several )Tj
T*(years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army )Tj
T*(nurse at the front and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the )Tj
T*(downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled to the )Tj
T*(Crimea with her husband and children, where they lived under the threat of )Tj
T*(assassination. Her brother and his family were shot by revolutionaries. )Tj
T*( Olga escaped revolutionary Russia with her second husband and their two sons )Tj
T*(in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In )Tj
T*(exile, Olga acted as companion and secretary to her mother, and was often )Tj
T*(sought out by Romanov impostors who claimed to be her dead relatives. She met )Tj
T*(Anna Anderson, the best-known impostor, in Berlin in 1925. After the Dowager )Tj
T*(Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in )Tj
T*(Ballerup, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working )Tj

T*(there in 1958. Two years later, as her health deteriorated, Olga moved with )Tj
T*(devoted friends to a small apartment in East Toronto. She died aged 78, seven )Tj

T*( Olga was the youngest daughter of Tsar Alexander III and his consort, Marie )Tj
T*(Feodorovna, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She was born in the purple, )Tj
T*(i.e. during her father's reign, on 13 June 1882 in the Peterhof Palace, west of )Tj
T*(Saint Petersburg. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from )Tj
T*(the ramparts of the Peter and Paul Fortress, and similar salutes throughout the )Tj
T*(Russian Empire.[1] Her mother, advised by her sister, Alexandra, Princess of )Tj
T*(Wales, placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin.[1] )Tj
T*( The Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins, so for safety )Tj
T*(reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about )Tj
T*(50¬†miles \(80¬†km\) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were )Tj
T*(not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were )Tj
T*(modest, even Spartan.[2] They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in )Tj
T*(cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.[2] )Tj
T*( Olga left Gatchina for the first time in the early fall of 1888 when the )Tj
T*(imperial family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train )Tj
T*(approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four )Tj
T*(older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched )Tj
T*(violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron )Tj
T*(roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar )Tj
T*(crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with "a Herculean )Tj
T*(effort" so that the others could escape.[3] There were 21 fatalities. Empress )Tj
T*(Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own )Tj
T*(clothes.[4] An official investigation found that the crash was an accident,[5] )Tj
T*(but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.[4] )Tj
T*( The Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors. )Tj
T*(Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English and French, as well as )Tj
T*(drawing and dancing.[6] Physical activities such as equestrianism were taught )Tj
T*(at an early age, and they became expert riders.[7] The family was deeply )Tj
T*(religious. Although Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and )Tj
T*(extravagance, Lent was strictly observed‚Äîmeat, dairy products and any form of )Tj
T*(entertainment were avoided.[8] Family holidays were taken in the summer at )Tj
T*(Peterhof and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark.[9] )Tj
T*( Empress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child, and their )Tj
T*(relationship remained a difficult one.[10] However, Olga, her father, and the )Tj
T*(youngest of her brothers, Michael, had a close relationship. Together, the )Tj
T*(three frequently went on hikes within the Gatchina forests, where the Tsar )Tj
T*(taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship.[11] Olga said of her father: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(My father was everything to me. Immersed in work as he was, he always spared )Tj
T*(that daily half-hour.¬†‚Ä¶ once my father showed me a very old album full of most )Tj
T*(exciting pen and ink sketches of an imaginary city called Mopsopolis, inhabited )Tj
T*(by Mopses [pug dogs]. He showed it to me in secret, and I was thrilled to have )Tj
T*(him share his own childhood secrets with me.[12])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( During 1894 Olga's father became increasingly ill, and the annual trip to )Tj
T*(Denmark was cancelled.[13] On 13 November 1894, he died at the age of 49. The )Tj
T*(emotional impact on Olga, aged only 12, was traumatic,[14] and her eldest )Tj
T*(brother, the new Tsar Nicholas II, was propelled into a role for which in )Tj
T*(Olga's later opinion he was ill-prepared.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Court life )Tj
T*( Olga was due to enter society in the summer of 1899, but after the death of )Tj
T*(her brother George at the age of 27, her first official public appearance was )Tj
T*(delayed by a year until 1900.[16] She hated the experience, and later told her )Tj
T*(official biographer Ian Vorres, "I felt as though I were an animal in a )Tj
T*(cage‚Äîexhibited to the public for the first time."[17] From 1901, Olga was )Tj
T*(appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of )Tj
T*(the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory )Tj
T*(over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, and wore a distinctive )Tj

T*(cousin, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian branch )Tj
T*(of the House of Oldenburg.[19] He was 14 years her senior and known for his )Tj
T*(passion for literature and gambling.[20] Peter asked for Olga's hand in )Tj
T*(marriage the following year, a proposal that took the grand duchess completely )Tj
T*(by surprise: "I was so taken aback that all I could say was 'thank you'," she )Tj
T*(later explained. [21] )Tj
T*( Their engagement, announced in May 1901, was unexpected by family and friends, )Tj
T*(as Peter had shown no prior interest in women,[17] and members of society )Tj
T*(assumed he was homosexual.[22] At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married )Tj
T*(33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg )Tj
T*(palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while )Tj
T*(her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning.[23] Their )Tj
T*(marriage remained unconsummated,[24] and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed )Tj
T*(into proposing by his ambitious mother.[25] Biographer Patricia Phenix thought )Tj
T*(Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, )Tj
T*(the Dowager Empress Marie, or avoid marriage into a foreign court.[26] The )Tj
T*(couple initially lived with her in laws Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg )Tj
T*(and Eug√©nie Maximilianovna of Leuchtenberg. It was not an harmonious )Tj
T*(arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, )Tj
T*(berated their only son for his laziness.[23] Eug√©nie, a close friend of Empress )Tj
T*(Marie, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had )Tj
T*(been a present to Jos√©phine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a )Tj
T*(dislike towards her mother in law.[23] A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and )Tj
T*(her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, where they boarded a yacht loaned to )Tj
T*(them by King Edward VII of Great Britain and sailed to Sorrento, Italy.[27] )Tj
T*( On their return to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace \(the former )Tj
T*(Baryatinsky mansion\) at 46 Sergievskaya Street \(today Tchaikovskogo Street\), )Tj
T*(Saint Petersburg.[28] The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, )Tj
T*(now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The grand )Tj
T*(duchess had her own studio to draw, but in their large palace, Olga and Peter )Tj
T*(had separate bedrooms at opposite ends of the building.[29] Unhappy in her )Tj
T*(marriage, Olga fell into bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, )Tj
T*(forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.[30] )Tj
T*( Near the Oldenburg's estate, Ramon in Voronezh province, Olga had her own )Tj
T*(villa, called "Olgino" after the local town.[31] She subsidized the village )Tj

T*(daughter-in-law later wrote, "She tried to help every needy person as far as )Tj
T*(her strengths and means would permit."[32] At the hospital, she learned basic )Tj
T*(medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor.[33] She exemplified )Tj
T*(her strong Orthodox faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to )Tj
T*(the charitable endeavours she supported.[32] At Ramon Olga and Peter enjoyed )Tj

T*( In April 1903, she was introduced to a Blue Cuirassier Guards officer Nikolai )Tj
T*(Kulikovsky by her brother Michael during a royal military review at Pavlovsk )Tj
T*(Palace.[36] Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other, and exchanged letters )Tj
T*(regularly. The same year, at the age of 22, she confronted her husband and )Tj
T*(asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might )Tj
T*(reconsider after seven years.[37] Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky )Tj
T*(as an aide-de-camp, and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg )Tj

T*(weekend throughout the winter.[42] She especially took a liking to the youngest )Tj
T*(of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called Shvipsik )Tj
T*(\("little one"\).[43] Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met Rasputin, a )Tj
T*(self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no )Tj
T*(public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was )Tj
T*(unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him.[44] As Olga grew )Tj
T*(close to her brother's family, her relationship with her other surviving )Tj
T*(brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped )Tj
T*(with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael )Tj
T*(and the rest of the family was essentially cut off.[45] )Tj
T*( Public unrest over the Russo-Japanese War and demands for political reform )Tj
T*(increased in the early years of the twentieth century. At Epiphany 1905, a band )Tj
T*(of revolutionaries fired live rounds at the Winter Palace from the Peter and )Tj
T*(Paul Fortress. Olga and the Dowager Empress were showered with glass splinters )Tj
T*(from a smashed window, but were unharmed.[46] Three weeks later, on "Bloody )Tj
T*(Sunday", at least 92 people were killed by Cossack troops during a )Tj
T*(demonstration,[47] and a month later Olga's uncle, Grand Duke Sergei )Tj
T*(Alexandrovich of Russia, was assassinated.[48] Uprisings occurred throughout )Tj
T*(the country, and parts of the navy mutinied.[49] Olga supported the appointment )Tj
T*(of the liberal Pyotr Stolypin as prime minister, and he embarked on a programme )Tj
T*(of gradual reform, but in 1911 he was assassinated.[50] The public unrest, )Tj
T*(Michael's elopement, and Olga's sham marriage placed her under strain, and in )Tj
T*(1912, while visiting England with her mother, she suffered a nervous )Tj
T*(breakdown.[51]Tsarina Alexandra was also unwell with fatigue, concerned by the )Tj
T*(poor health of her hemophiliac son, Alexei.[52] Olga stood in for the Tsarina )Tj
T*(at public events, and accompanied her brother on a tour of the interior, while )Tj
T*(the Tsarina remained at home.[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] War and revolution )Tj
T*( On 1 August 1914, just before the start of World War I, Olga's regiment, the )Tj
T*(Akhtyrsky Hussars, appeared at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at )Tj
T*(Krasnoe Selo.[54] Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were )Tj
T*(stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia.[18] With the Grand )Tj
T*(Duchess's prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino, she started work )Tj
T*(as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in Rovno, near to where her )Tj
T*(own regiment was stationed.[55] During the war, she came under heavy Austrian )Tj
T*(fire while attending the regiment at the front. Nurses rarely worked so close )Tj
T*(to the frontlines and consequently she was awarded the Order of St. George by )Tj
T*(General Mannerheim, who later became President of Finland.[18] As the Russians )Tj
T*(lost ground to the Central Powers, Olga's hospital was moved eastwards to )Tj
T*(Kiev,[56] and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad.[57] )Tj
T*( In 1916, Tsar Nicholas II officially annulled the marriage between Duke Peter )Tj
T*(Alexandrovich and the Grand Duchess, allowing her to marry Colonel )Tj
T*(Kulikovsky.[58] The service was performed on 16 November 1916 in the )Tj
T*(Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya \(Three Saints Street\) in )Tj
T*(Kiev. The only guests were the Dowager Empress Marie, Olga's brother-in-law )Tj
T*(Grand Duke Alexander, four officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, and two of )Tj
T*(Olga's fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev.[59] )Tj
T*( During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued )Tj
T*(to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in )Tj
T*(early 1917, many members of the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his )Tj
T*(immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the )Tj
T*(Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga traveled to the )Tj
T*(Crimea by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister Grand Duchess )Tj
T*(Xenia.[60] They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12¬†miles \(19¬†km\) )Tj
T*(from Yalta, where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces.[61] )Tj
T*(On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during )Tj
T*(their virtual imprisonment. He was named after Tikhon of Zadonsk, the Saint )Tj
T*(venerated near the Grand Duchess's estate at Olgino.[18] Although Tikhon was )Tj
T*(the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, neither he nor his )Tj
T*(younger brother Guri received any title as his father was a commoner. )Tj

T*( The Romanovs isolated in the Crimea knew little of the fate of the Tsar and )Tj
T*(his family. Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children, were originally held at )Tj
T*(their official residence, the Alexander Palace, but the Provisional government )Tj
T*(under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk, Siberia. In February 1918, )Tj
T*(most of the imperial family at Ay-Todor was moved to another estate at Djulber, )Tj
T*(where Grand Dukes Nicholas and Peter were already under house arrest. Olga and )Tj
T*(her husband were left at Ay-Todor. The entire Romanov family in the Crimea was )Tj
T*(condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council, but the executions were )Tj
T*(delayed by political rivalry between the Yalta and Sevastopol Soviets.[62] By )Tj
T*(March 1918, the Central Power of Germany had advanced on the Crimea, and the )Tj
T*(revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.[63] In November 1918, the )Tj
T*(German forces were informed that their nation had lost the war, and they )Tj
T*(evacuated homewards. Allied forces took over the Crimean ports, in support of )Tj
T*(the loyalist White Army, which temporarily allowed the surviving members of the )Tj
T*(Romanov family time to escape abroad. The Dowager Empress Marie and, at her )Tj
T*(insistence, most of her family and friends were evacuated by the British )Tj
T*(warship HMS Marlborough. Nicholas II, however, had already been assassinated )Tj
T*(and the family assumed, correctly, that his wife and children had also been )Tj
T*(killed.[64] Unknown to her, Olga's childhood confidant and brother Michael, the )Tj
T*(emperor's supposed successor, had been assassinated near Perm on 13 June 1918. )Tj
T*( Olga and her husband refused to leave Russia, and decided to move to the )Tj
T*(Caucasus, which the White Army had cleared of revolutionary Bolsheviks.[65] An )Tj
T*(imperial bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large )Tj
T*(Cossack village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-roomed farmhouse there, Olga )Tj
T*(gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919.[66] He was )Tj
T*(named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the )Tj
T*(Akhtyrsky Regiment during World War I. In November 1919, the family set out on )Tj
T*(what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary )Tj
T*(troops, they escaped to Novorossiysk, and took refuge in the residence of the )Tj
T*(Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe )Tj
T*(arrival in Denmark.[67] After a brief stay with the consul, the family were )Tj
T*(shipped to a refugee camp on the island of B√ºy√ºkada in the Dardanelles Strait )Tj
T*(near Istanbul, Turkey, where Olga, her husband and children shared three rooms )Tj
T*(with eleven other adults.[68] After two weeks, they were evacuated to Belgrade )Tj
T*(in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by Regent )Tj
T*(Alexander Karageorgevich, later King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Alexander )Tj
T*(offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was )Tj
T*(summoned to Denmark by her mother.[67] On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family )Tj
T*(arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress Marie, at first at )Tj
T*(the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvid√∏re, where Olga )Tj
T*(acted as her mother's secretary and companion.[69] It was a difficult )Tj
T*(arrangement at times. The dowager empress insisted on having Olga at her beck )Tj
T*(and call. Never reconciled with the idea of her daughter's marriage to a )Tj
T*(commoner, Marie was cold towards Kulikovsky rarely allowing him in her )Tj
T*(presence.[70]At formal functions, Olga was expected to accompany her mother )Tj
T*(alone. The empress also found Olga's young sons too boisterous.[70] )Tj

T*(have been the first to recognize her, understand her desperate plight, and )Tj
T*(symphathize with her.[72])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Anderson stated she was in Berlin to inform Princess Irene of Prussia \(sister )Tj
T*(of Tsarina Alexandra and cousin of Tsar Nicholas II\) of her survival. Olga )Tj
T*(commented, "[Princess Irene] was one of the most straightlaced women in her )Tj
T*(generation. My niece would have known that her condition would have indeed have )Tj
T*(shocked [her]."[72] )Tj
T*( Olga met Anderson, who was being treated for tuberculosis, at a nursing home. )Tj
T*(Of the visit Olga later said: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(My beloved Anastasia was fifteen when I saw her for the last time in the summer )Tj
T*(of 1916. She would have been twenty-four in 1925. I thought Mrs. Anderson )Tj
T*(looked much older than that. Of course, one had to make allowances for a very )Tj
T*(long illness¬†... All the same, my niece's features could not possibly have )Tj
T*(altered out of all recognition. The nose, the mouth, the eyes were all )Tj
T*(different.[73]¬†... As soon as I sat down by that bed in the Mommsen Nursing )Tj
T*(Home, I knew I was looking at a stranger.¬†‚Ä¶ I had left Denmark with something )Tj
T*(of a hope in my heart. I left Berlin with all hope extinguished.[74])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In addition, Olga said she was dismayed that Anderson spoke only German and )Tj
T*(showed no sign of knowing either English or Russian, while Anastasia spoke both )Tj
T*(those languages fluently and was ignorant of German.[75] Nevertheless, Olga )Tj
T*(remained sympathetic towards Anderson, perhaps because she thought that she was )Tj
T*(ill rather than deliberately deceitful.[76] Olga later explained: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(...¬†she did not strike me as an out-and-out impostor. Her brusqueness warred )Tj
T*(against it. A cunning impostor would have done all she could to ingratiate )Tj
T*(herself¬†... But Mrs. Anderson's manner would have put anyone off. My own )Tj
T*(conviction is that it all started with some unscrupulous people who hoped they )Tj
T*(might lay their hands on at least a share of the fabulous and utterly )Tj
T*(non-existent Romanov fortune¬†... I had a feeling she was 'briefed,' as it were, )Tj
T*(but far from perfectly. The mistakes she made could not all be attributed to )Tj
T*(lapses of memory. For instance, she had a scar on one of her fingers and she )Tj
T*(kept telling everybody that it had been crushed because of a footman shutting )Tj
T*(the door of a landau too quickly. And at once I remembered the real incident. )Tj
T*(It was Marie, her elder sister, who got her hand hurt rather badly, and it did )Tj
T*(not happen in a carriage but on board the imperial train. Obviously someone, )Tj
T*(having heard something of the incident, had passed a garbled version of it to )Tj
T*(Mrs. Anderson.[74])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Conceivably, Olga was initially either open to the possibility that Anderson )Tj
T*(was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind.[77] Anderson's biographer and )Tj
T*(supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf )Tj
T*(Zahle, at the end of October 1925: "My feeling is that she is not the one she )Tj
T*(believes‚Äîbut one can't say she is not as a fact".[78] However, within a month )Tj
T*(she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, "There is no resemblance, and )Tj
T*(she is undoubtedly not A."[79][80] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, )Tj
T*(which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson )Tj
T*(as Anastasia.[81] Olga later said she sent the gift and letters "out of )Tj
T*(pity",[82] and called the claims "a complete fabrication".[82] When Olga )Tj
T*(refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement )Tj
T*(denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper,[83] Anderson's supporters, )Tj
T*(Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on )Tj
T*(instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in )Tj
T*(private letters and sworn testimony.[84][85] She told her official biographer, )Tj
T*("I never received any such telegram."[82] The supposed telegram was never )Tj

T*( [edit] Danish residency and exodus )Tj
T*( The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvid√∏re. Her estate was sold )Tj
T*(and Olga purchased Knudsminde, a farm in Ballerup about 15¬†miles \(24¬†km\) from )Tj
T*(Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds.[88] They kept horses, in which )Tj
T*(Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, )Tj
T*(chickens, geese, dogs and cats.[89] For transport they had a small car and a )Tj
T*(sledge.[89] Tihon and Guri \(age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they )Tj
T*(moved to Knudsminde\) grew up on the farm. Olga ran the household with the help )Tj
T*(of her elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso \("Mimka"\), who had come along )Tj
T*(with her from Russia. The grand duchess lived with simplicity working in the )Tj
T*(fields, doing household chores and painting.&lt;refname=H58/&gt; )Tj
T*( Her farm-estate became a center for the Russian monarchist community in )Tj
T*(Denmark and many Russian emigrants visited.[90] She maintained a high level of )Tj
T*(correspondence with the Russian √©migr√© community and former members of the )Tj
T*(Russian imperial army.[67] In the 1930s, the family took annual holidays at )Tj
T*(Sofiero Castle, Sweden, with Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and his wife, )Tj
T*(Louise.[91] Olga began to sell her own paintings of Russian and Danish scenes, )Tj
T*(with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen, London, Paris, and Berlin. Some of the )Tj
T*(proceeds were donated to the charities she supported.[67] )Tj
T*( Neutral Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, and was occupied )Tj
T*(for the remainder of World War II. Food shortages, communication restrictions, )Tj
T*(and transportation closures followed. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served )Tj
T*(as officers in the Danish Army, they were interned as prisoners of war, but )Tj
T*(their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months.[92] )Tj
T*(Tikhon was imprisoned for a further month in 1943 after being arrested on )Tj
T*(charges of espionage.[93] Other Russian √©migr√©s, keen to fight against the )Tj
T*(Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her )Tj
T*(mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with )Tj
T*(German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian √©migr√©s )Tj
T*(fighting against communism.[94] On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark )Tj
T*(surrendered to the British. When economic and social conditions for Russian )Tj
T*(exiles failed to improve, General Pyotr Krasnov wrote to the Grand Duchess, )Tj
T*(detailing the wretched conditions affecting Russian immigrants in Denmark.[95] )Tj
T*(She in turn asked Prince Axel of Denmark to help them, but her request was )Tj
T*(refused.[96] )Tj
T*( The Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish )Tj
T*(Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government.[97] With the end )Tj
T*(of World War II, Soviet troops came close to the Danish border, and the )Tj
T*(surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap )Tj

T*(at Toronto General Hospital.[112] She was not informed[113] or was not )Tj
T*(aware[114] that her elder sister, Xenia, died in London that month. Unable to )Tj

T*(1960, after a funeral service at Christ the Saviour Cathedral, Toronto. )Tj
T*(Officers of the Akhtyrsky Hussars and the Blue Cuirassiers stood guard in the )Tj
T*(small Russian church, which overflowed with mourners.[117] Although she lived )Tj

T*(Canadian dollars as of 2010[118]\) and was mostly held as stock and bonds.[119] )Tj

T*( The Act succeeded in its initial aim of establishing a mental health care )Tj
T*(system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a mental health )Tj
T*(trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians )Tj
T*(systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable )Tj
T*(land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset-stripping was )Tj
T*(eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a )Tj
T*(reconstituted mental health trust was established in the mid-1980s. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background to the act )Tj
T*( Alaska possessed no mental health treatment facilities prior to the passage of )Tj
T*(the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, )Tj
T*(being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of )Tj
T*(the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating )Tj
T*(back to the turn of the 19th to 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United )Tj
T*(States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of )Tj
T*(Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was )Tj
T*(signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo )Tj
T*(Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to )Tj
T*(the hospital for treatment.[3] A commitment regime was established under which )Tj
T*(a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, )Tj
T*(who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison )Tj
T*(until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a )Tj
T*(medical or psychiatric examination required.[4] )Tj
T*( By the 1940s it was recognized that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The )Tj
T*(American Medical Association conducted a series of studies in 1948, followed by )Tj
T*(a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies )Tj
T*(of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip )Tj
T*(to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, )Tj
T*(an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which )Tj
T*(owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make )Tj
T*(an excess profit of $69,000 per year \(equivalent to over $588,000 per year at )Tj
T*(2007 prices\).[3] )Tj
T*( The studies recommended a comprehensive overhaul of the system, with the )Tj
T*(development of an in-state mental health program for Alaska. This proposal was )Tj
T*(widely supported by the public and politicians. At the start of 1956, in the )Tj
T*(second session of the 84th Congress, Representative Edith Green \(D-Oregon\) )Tj
T*(introduced the Alaska Mental Health Bill \(H.R. 6376\) in the House of )Tj
T*(Representatives. The bill had been written by Bob Bartlett, the Congressional )Tj
T*(Delegate from the Alaska Territory who later became a U.S. Senator.[2] Senator )Tj
T*(Richard L. Neuberger \(D-Oregon\) sponsored an equivalent bill, S. 2518, in the )Tj
T*(Senate. )Tj
T*( [edit] Details of the bill )Tj
T*( The Alaska Mental Health Bill's stated purpose was to "transfer from the )Tj
T*(Federal Government to the Territory of Alaska basic responsibility for the )Tj
T*(hospitalization, care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska." In )Tj
T*(connection with this goal, it aimed: )Tj
T*( to modernize procedures for such hospitalization \(including commitment\), care, )Tj
T*(and treatment and to authorize the Territory to modify or supersede such )Tj
T*(procedures;)Tj
T*(to assist in providing for the Territory necessary facilities for a )Tj
T*(comprehensive mental-health program in Alaska, including inpatient and )Tj
T*(outpatient facilities;)Tj
T*(to provide for a land grant to the Territory to assist in placing the program )Tj
T*(on a firm long-term basis; and)Tj
T*(to provide for a ten-year program, of grants-in-aid to the Territory to enable )Tj
T*(the Territory gradually to assume the full operating costs of the program.[5])Tj
T*(  The bill provided for a cash grant of $12.5 million \(about $94 million at )Tj
T*(2007 prices\) to be disbursed to the Alaskan government in a number of phases, )Tj
T*(to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet )Tj

T*(the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres \(4,000¬†)Tj
T*(km¬≤\) of federally-owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new )Tj
T*(Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid‚Äîthe federal government owned about )Tj
T*(99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then be able to use the )Tj
T*(assets of the transferred land \(principally mineral and forestry rights\) to )Tj
T*(obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. )Tj
T*(Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision )Tj
T*(of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.[4] )Tj
T*( In addition, the bill granted the Governor of Alaska authority to enter into )Tj
T*(reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors of other )Tj
T*(states. Alaskans who became mentally ill in the lower 48 states would be )Tj
T*(properly treated locally until they could be returned to Alaska; likewise, )Tj
T*(citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care )Tj
T*(there, before being returned to their home states.[4] )Tj
T*( The bill was seen as entirely innocuous when it was introduced on January 16, )Tj
T*(1956. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and on January 18 it was passed )Tj
T*(unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to )Tj
T*(consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected )Tj
T*(to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on )Tj
T*(February 20.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Controversy )Tj
T*( [edit] Sounding the alarm )Tj
T*( In December 1955, a small anti-communist women's group in southern California, )Tj
T*(the American Public Relations Forum \(APRF\), issued an urgent call to arms in )Tj
T*(its monthly bulletin. It highlighted the proposed text of the Alaska Mental )Tj
T*(Health Bill, calling it "one that tops all of them". The bulletin writers )Tj
T*(commented: "We could not help remembering that Siberia is very near Alaska and )Tj
T*(since it is obvious no one needs such a large land grant, we were wondering if )Tj
T*(it could be an American Siberia." They said that the bill "takes away all of )Tj
T*(the rights of the American citizen to ask for a jury trial and protect )Tj
T*(him[self] from being railroaded to an asylum by a greedy relative or 'friend' )Tj
T*(or, as the Alaska bill states, 'an interested party'."[2] )Tj
T*( The APRF had a history of opposing mental health legislation; earlier in 1955, )Tj
T*(it had played a key role in stalling the passage of three mental health bills )Tj
T*(in the California Assembly. It was part of a wider network of far-right )Tj
T*(organizations which opposed psychiatry and psychology as being pro-communist, )Tj
T*(anti-American, anti-Christian and pro-Jewish.[2] The Keep America Committee, )Tj
T*(another Californian "superpatriot" group, summed up the anti-mental health mood )Tj
T*(on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955. Calling "mental hygiene" )Tj
T*(part of the "unholy three" of the "Communistic World Government", it declared: )Tj
T*("Mental Hygiene is a subtle and diabolical plan of the enemy to transform a )Tj
T*(free and intelligent people into a cringing horde of zombies".[6] )Tj
T*( The APRF's membership overlapped with that of the much larger Minute Women of )Tj
T*(the U.S.A., a nationwide organization of militant anti-communist housewives )Tj
T*(which claimed up to 50,000 members across the United States. In mid-January )Tj
T*(1956, Minute Woman Leigh F. Burkeland of Van Nuys, California issued a bulletin )Tj
T*(protesting against the bill. It was mimeographed by the California State )Tj

T*( [edit] Fanning the flames )Tj
T*( After the Santa Ana Register published its article, a nationwide network of )Tj
T*(activists began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill. )Tj
T*(The campaigners included, among other groups and individuals, the white )Tj
T*(supremacist Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith; Women for God and Country; the For America )Tj
T*(League; the Minute Women of the U.S.A.; the right-wing agitator Dan Smoot; the )Tj
T*(anti-Catholic former US Army Brigadier General Herbert C. Holdridge; and L. Ron )Tj
T*(Hubbard's Church of Scientology, which had been founded only two years earlier. )Tj
T*( Increasingly strong statements were made by the bill's opponents through the )Tj
T*(course of the spring and summer of 1956. In his February 17 bulletin, Dan Smoot )Tj
T*(told his subscribers: "I do not doubt that the Alaska Mental Health Act was )Tj
T*(written by sincere, well-intentioned men. Nonetheless, it fits into a sinister )Tj
T*(pattern which has been forming ever since the United Nations was )Tj
T*(organized."[8]Dr. George A. Snyder of Hollywood sent a letter to all members of )Tj
T*(Congress in which he demanded an investigation of the Alaska Mental Health )Tj
T*(Bill's proponents for "elements of treason against the American people behind )Tj
T*(the front of the mental health program." The Keep America Committee of Los )Tj
T*(Angeles similarly called the proponents of the bill a "conspiratorial gang" )Tj
T*(that ought to be "investigated, impeached, or at least removed from office" for )Tj
T*(treason.[2] Retired brigadier general Herbert C. Holdridge sent a public letter )Tj
T*(to President Dwight Eisenhower on March 12, in which he called the bill "a )Tj
T*(dastardly attempt to establish a concentration camp in the Alaskan wastes." He )Tj
T*(went on: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(This bill establishes a weapon of violence against our citizenry far more )Tj
T*(wicked than anything ever known in recorded history ‚Äî far worse than the )Tj
T*(Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or the violence of the )Tj
T*(Spanish Inquisition ‚Ä¶ The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks )Tj
T*(of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican, )Tj
T*(and, through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.[3])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( For their part, America's professional health associations \(notably the )Tj
T*(American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association\) came out in )Tj
T*(favour of the bill. There was some initial opposition from the Association of )Tj
T*(American Physicians and Surgeons, a small and extremely conservative body which )Tj
T*(opposed socialized medicine; Dr. L. S. Sprague of Tucson, Arizona said in its )Tj
T*(March 1956 newsletter that the bill widened the definition of mental health to )Tj
T*(cover "everything from falling hair to ingrown toenails." However, the )Tj
T*(association modified its position after it became clear that the AMA took the )Tj
T*(opposite view.[3] )Tj
T*( By March 1956, it was being said in Washington, D.C. that the amount of )Tj
T*(correspondence on the bill exceeded anything seen since the previous high-water )Tj
T*(mark of public controversy, the Lend-Lease Act of 1941.[2] Numerous )Tj
T*(letter-writers protested to their Congressional representatives that the bill )Tj
T*(was "anti-religious" or that the land to be transferred to the Alaska Mental )Tj
T*(Health Trust would be fenced off and used as a concentration camp for the )Tj
T*(political enemies of various state governors.[9] The well-known broadcaster )Tj
T*(Fulton Lewis described how he had "received, literally, hundreds of letters )Tj
T*(protesting bitterly against the bill. I have had telephone calls to the same )Tj
T*(effect from California, Texas and other parts of the country. Members of )Tj
T*(Congress report identical reactions."[10] A letter printed in the Daily )Tj
T*(Oklahoman newspaper in May 1956 summed up many of the arguments made by )Tj
T*(opponents of the bill: )Tj

T*(passed the Alaska Mental Health Act.)Tj
T*(The Act was prepared by the U.S. Department of Justice, Department of the )Tj
T*(Interior and the socialist-oriented Department of Health, Education and )Tj
T*(Welfare. It closely follows the Model Code, drafted by the American Psychiatric )Tj
T*(association, which has been working with the World Health Organization, a )Tj
T*(specialized agency of the United Nations ‚Ä¶)Tj
T*(All of you who don't want members of your family railroaded to an asylum had )Tj
T*(better start writing your senator, now.[11])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( During February and March 1956, hearings were held before the Senate )Tj
T*(Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs. Proponents and opponents of )Tj
T*(the bill faced off in a series of tense exchanges, with strong accusations )Tj
T*(being made against the people and groups involved in the bill's introduction. )Tj
T*(Stephanie Williams of the American Public Relations Forum said that the bill )Tj
T*(would enable Russia to reclaim its former Alaskan territory: "[it] contains )Tj
T*(nothing to prevent Russia from buying the entire million acres ‚Äî they already )Tj
T*(say Alaska belongs to them." [12] )Tj
T*( Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense )Tj
T*(castigated the slackness of Congress for not picking up on the bill's perceived )Tj
T*(dangers: "Those of us who have been in the study and research work of the )Tj
T*(United Nations, we feel that we are experts in this . . . you as Senators with )Tj
T*(all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all )Tj
T*(these things." John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had )Tj
T*(achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared )Tj
T*(that "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about )Tj
T*(eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish . . . one particular race is )Tj
T*(administering this particular thing." He argued that Jews were nationalists of )Tj
T*(another country who were attempting to "usurp American nationality." [4][6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Passing the bill )Tj
T*( The arguments of the bill's opponents attracted little support in the Senate. )Tj
T*(The Eisenhower administration, the Alaska territorial government and mainstream )Tj
T*(religious groups were all in favor of the bill. The Alaska Presbyterian Church )Tj
T*(gave the bill its unanimous support, issuing a statement declaring: "As )Tj
T*(Christian citizens of Alaska we believe this is a progressive measure for the )Tj
T*(care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska. We deplore the present )Tj
T*(antiquated methods of handling our mentally ill." It also urged the National )Tj
T*(Council of Churches to mobilize support for the bill.[13] An overwhelming )Tj
T*(majority of senators of both parties were also supportive. The bill's original )Tj
T*(author, Alaska Delegate Bob Bartlett, spoke for many of the bill's proponents )Tj
T*(when he expressed his bafflement at the response that it had received: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I am completely at a loss in attempting to fathom the reasons why certain )Tj
T*(individuals and certain groups have now started a letter-writing campaign ‚Ä¶ to )Tj
T*(defeat the act. I am sure that if the letter writers would consult the facts, )Tj
T*(they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law )Tj
T*(but in working for its speedy passage and approval.[2])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Other senators expressed similar mystification at the agitation against the )Tj
T*(bill. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington stated that he was "at a loss" to )Tj
T*(see how the bill affected religion, as its opponents said.[9] Senator Alan )Tj
T*(Bible of Nevada, the acting chairman of the Subcommittee on Territories and )Tj
T*(Insular Affairs, told the bill's opponents that nothing in the proposed )Tj
T*(legislation would permit the removal of any non-Alaskan to the territory for )Tj
T*(confinement.[12] )Tj
T*( Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona proposed an amended bill that )Tj
T*(removed the commitment procedures in title I of the House bill and stated that )Tj
T*("Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska, )Tj
T*(pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, of any mentally ill person who is not a )Tj
T*(resident of Alaska." In effect, this eliminated the bill's most controversial )Tj

T*(states to Alaska.[4] The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on )Tj
T*(Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater's lead that the bill be amended )Tj
T*(to strike all the controversial "detailed provisions for commitment, )Tj
T*(hospitalization, and care of the mentally ill of Alaska" included in title I of )Tj
T*(the original House bill. This amended proposal left only the transfer of )Tj
T*(responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the )Tj
T*(establishment of land grants to support this care. The committee stressed that )Tj
T*(they were not invalidating the title I provisions of the original bill but that )Tj
T*(they had been misunderstood, a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(However, the proposed provisions were misunderstood by many persons in parts of )Tj
T*(the country other than Alaska. Partly as a result of this misunderstanding, but )Tj
T*(more because the members of the committee are convinced that the people of )Tj
T*(Alaska are fully capable of drafting their own laws for a mental health program )Tj
T*(for Alaska, the committee concluded that authority should be vested in them in )Tj
T*(this field comparable to that of the States and other Territories.[14])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Thus amended, the Senate bill \(S. 2973\) was passed unanimously by the Senate )Tj
T*(on July 20, after only ten minutes of debate.[2][3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( Following the passage of the act, an Alaska Mental Health Trust was set up to )Tj
T*(administer the land and grants appropriated to fund the Alaskan mental health )Tj
T*(program. During the 1970s, the issue of the trust's land became increasingly )Tj
T*(controversial, with the state coming under increasing pressure to develop the )Tj
T*(land for private and recreational use. In 1978, the Alaska Legislature passed a )Tj
T*(law to abolish the trust and transfer the most valuable parcels of lands to )Tj
T*(private individuals and the government.[15] By 1982, 40,000 acres \(160¬†km2\) had )Tj
T*(been conveyed to municipalities, 50,000 acres \(200¬†km2\) transferred to )Tj
T*(individuals, and slightly over 350,000 acres \(1,400¬†km2\) designated as forests, )Tj
T*(parks or wildlife areas. Around 35 percent of the land trust remained )Tj
T*(unencumbered and in state ownership.[16] )Tj
T*( The loss of the land and the revenue earned from it had a severe effect on )Tj
T*(mental health care in the state.[citation needed] In 1982, Alaska resident Vern )Tj
T*(Weiss filed a lawsuit on behalf of his son, who required mental health services )Tj
T*(that were not available in Alaska. The case of Weiss v State of Alaska )Tj
T*(eventually became a class action lawsuit involving a range of mental health )Tj
T*(care groups. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the abolition of the )Tj
T*(trust had been illegal and ordered it to be reconstituted. However, as much of )Tj
T*(the original land had been transferred away, the parties had to undergo a long )Tj
T*(and complex series of negotiations to resolve the situation. A final settlement )Tj
T*(was reached in 1994 in which the trust was reconstituted with 500,000 acres )Tj
T*(\(2,000¬†km2\) of original trust land, 500,000 acres \(2,000¬†km2\) of replacement )Tj
T*(land, and $200 million to replace lost income and assets.[16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Scientology and the Alaska Mental Health Bill )Tj
T*( The Alaska Mental Health Bill plays a major part in the Church of )Tj
T*(Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry. The Church )Tj
T*(participated in the campaign against the Bill and still refers to it as the )Tj
T*("Siberia Bill". Scientology may also have provided an important piece of the )Tj
T*("evidence" which the anti-bill campaigners used ‚Äî a booklet titled )Tj
T*(Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics, which has )Tj
T*(been widely attributed to the anonymous authorship of L. Ron Hubbard \(see )Tj

T*(to establish a million-acre \(4,000 km¬≤\) Siberia-type camp for mental health )Tj
T*(patients in Alaska, far from the prying eyes of civil libertarians"[17] which )Tj
T*("presumably ... was far enough away from the well-traveled roads of the world )Tj
T*(to allow psychiatrists to conduct their mind control and other experiments on a )Tj

T*(and sent without trial to Alaska, deprived of human and civil rights and )Tj
T*(detained forever, all without trial or examination."[19] According to the )Tj
T*(Church's Freedom Magazine: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(the bill came to the attention of Scientologists in 1956, only two years after )Tj
T*(the Church of Scientology had been established. ‚Ä¶ Scientologists responded with )Tj
T*(a campaign to inform the public of the very real threat to personal liberties )Tj
T*(and freedom of speech posed by the measure. If passed, it would have created a )Tj
T*(potential "gulag" where political undesirables could be dumped and simply )Tj
T*(forgotten. The hope of creating this psychiatric slave state was shattered by )Tj
T*(Scientologists. Refusing to allow vested interests to destroy the right of )Tj
T*(every citizen to freely speak his opinions without fear of retaliation they )Tj
T*(instituted a huge grassroots letter campaign. This alerted the Senate to public )Tj
T*(opposition and testimony was presented at Senate Committee hearings on the )Tj
T*(bill. Ultimately, except for granting a small amount of money for Alaska to )Tj
T*(continue "treating" its few existing mental patients, the Senate rejected the )Tj
T*(Siberia bill and it was never heard of again.[20])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Church officials have stated their belief that the American Psychiatric )Tj
T*(Association intensified its "interest in destroying Dianetics and Scientology )Tj
T*(organizations ... when the Church of Scientology actively opposed a bill whose )Tj
T*(introduction in Congress had been secure by the APA. ... The APA was well aware )Tj
T*(of who was behind the massive response that defeated the legislation, and they )Tj
T*(never forgot, as can be seen from some of the attacks its members )Tj
T*(generated."[21] )Tj
T*( [edit] Miscavige on Nightline )Tj
T*( Similarly, David Miscavige, the church's leader, in 1992 told Ted Koppel in an )Tj
T*(interview on the Nightline program: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I don't know if you're aware that there was a plan in 1955 in this country, )Tj
T*(Ted, to repeat what was done in Russia. There was going to be a Siberia, U.S.A. )Tj
T*(set up on a million acres \(4,000 km¬≤\) in Alaska to send mental patients. They )Tj
T*(were going to lessen the commitment laws, you could basically get into an )Tj
T*(argument with somebody and be sent up there. This sounds very odd. Nobody's )Tj
T*(ever heard about it. That's in no small part thanks to the Church of )Tj
T*(Scientology. I must say, though, that when that bill was killed in Congress, )Tj
T*(the war was on with psychiatry where they declared war on us ‚Ä¶ It was a major, )Tj
T*(major, major flap for the psychiatrists when it got voted down, because then )Tj
T*(the slogan around the country began, 'Siberia U.S.A.,' and it was really the )Tj
T*(first time that psychiatry had been denigrated publicly, that they weren't the )Tj
T*(science that they had been promoting themselves to be. And they took it upon )Tj
T*(themselves then to start dealing with anybody who would oppose them.[22])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Conspiracy theories )Tj
T*( In Ron's Journal 67, Hubbard identified "the people behind the Siberia Bill", )Tj
T*(who he asserted were )Tj
T*( less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher )Tj
T*(financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains, and they are, oddly )Tj
T*(enough, directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have )Tj
T*(sprung up. Now these chaps are very interesting fellows: They have )Tj
T*(fantastically corrupt backgrounds; illegitimate children; government graft; a )Tj
T*(very unsavory lot. And they apparently, sometime in the rather distant past, )Tj
T*(had determined on a course of action. Being in control of most of the gold )Tj
T*(supplies of the planet, they entered upon a program of bringing every )Tj
T*(government to bankruptcy and under their thumb, so that no government would be )Tj
T*(able to act politically without their permission.[23])Tj
T*(  According to David Miscavige, the bill was the product of a conspiracy by the )Tj
T*(American Psychiatric Association. In a public address in 1995, he told )Tj
T*(Scientologists that it was "in 1955 that the agents for the American )Tj
T*(Psychiatric Association met on Capitol Hill to ram home the infamous Siberia )Tj

T*("here that Mr. Hubbard, as the leader of a new and dynamic religious movement, )Tj
T*(knocked that Siberia Bill right out of the ring ‚Äî inflicting a blow they would )Tj
T*(never forget." [24] The assertion that Scientologists defeated the bill is made )Tj
T*(frequently in Scientology literature.[25] In fact, the original version of the )Tj
T*(bill with the offending Title I commitment provisions only passed the House of )Tj
T*(Representatives; it was subsequently amended in conference to strike the )Tj

T*(care. The revised bill passed easily without further changes.[14] )Tj
T*( [edit] Contemporary publications )Tj
T*( Contemporary Church publications suggest that although Hubbard was tracking )Tj
T*(progress of the bill at least as early as February 1956, Scientology did not )Tj
T*(become involved in the controversy until the start of March 1956, over two )Tj
T*(months after the American Public Relations Forum had first publicized the bill. )Tj
T*(A March "Professional Auditor's Bulletin" issued by Hubbard, who was staying in )Tj

T*( Although the church says that Scientologists led the opposition to the bill, )Tj
T*(the Congressional Record's account of the Senate hearings into the bill does )Tj
T*(not mention the church. A contemporary review of the opposition to the bill )Tj

T*( This was the first World Series appearance for the Cards, the first of eleven )Tj

T*(two games ahead of the runner-up Cincinnati Reds, after finishing only fourth )Tj
T*(in 1925 at 77-76. Before 1926 was half over, they traded outfielder Heinie )Tj

T*(The Cardinals' Game¬†2 starter was 39-year-old Grover Cleveland "Old Pete" )Tj

T*(he posted numbers considerably lower than the pitching season statistics from )Tj

T*(Alexander had compiled a 12‚Äì10 record in 200¬†innings, while posting a 3.05 ERA )Tj
T*(and 48 strikeouts, compared to the nearly 250 strikeouts he had in 1915 with )Tj
T*(the Phillies.[30] )Tj
T*( The Cardinals were first to bat in the game. After giving up a double to )Tj
T*(Rogers Hornsby, Shocker got a groundout from Jim Bottomley to end the )Tj
T*(run-scoring threat. In the Yankees' half of the inning, Mark Koenig grounded )Tj
T*(into a double play, and Babe Ruth followed by striking out. The Cardinals )Tj
T*(threatened again in the second inning, after back-to-back singles by catcher )Tj
T*(Bob O'Farrell and shortstop Tommy Thevenow. However, Alexander came to the )Tj
T*(plate and popped up to Koenig to end the inning. The Yankees scored first in )Tj
T*(the bottom of the second inning. Bob Meusel hit a single into center field, and )Tj
T*(Lou Gehrig followed by hitting a grounder to Alexander, which advanced Meusel )Tj
T*(to second base. Tony Lazzeri then hit a single to left field that scored Meusel )Tj
T*(from second. Joe Dugan followed with a single of his own, moving Lazzeri to )Tj
T*(third base. On the following play, Yankees catcher Hank Severeid struck out, )Tj
T*(and Lazzeri then attempted to steal home plate. Alexander made an error on his )Tj
T*(throw to catcher Bob O'Farrell, and Lazzeri was able to slide into home plate )Tj
T*(for the second Yankees run of the inning. O'Farrell then threw the ball to )Tj
T*(Thevenow, but the tag was late and Dugan was called safe at second base. The )Tj
T*(inning ended when Alexander struck out Shocker.[31] )Tj
T*( In the third inning, Taylor Douthit hit an infield single to shortstop Koenig, )Tj
T*(and Billy Southworth followed with a single to left field, advancing Douthit to )Tj

T*( [edit] Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester )Tj
T*( The 1926 World Series produced one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball )Tj
T*(history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old )Tj
T*(boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey, who was supposedly hospitalized after falling )Tj
T*(off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by )Tj
T*(Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent )Tj
T*(urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. )Tj
T*(Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by )Tj
T*(the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number )Tj
T*(of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, "I'll knock a homer )Tj
T*(for you on Wednesday".[46] After Ruth hit three home runs in Game¬†4 on )Tj
T*(Wednesday, October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had )Tj
T*(miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly )Tj
T*(publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which the boy said to Ruth, "I'm sorry )Tj
T*(the Yanks lost the series".[47] In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle )Tj
T*(visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy )Tj
T*(was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, )Tj
T*(Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, "Now who the )Tj
T*(hell is Johnny Sylvester?"[7]\(p81\)[48] )Tj
T*( There have been many alternate versions of this event. One version, which was )Tj
T*(later portrayed in The Babe Ruth Story, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's )Tj
T*(hospital bed and promised him in person that he would hit a home run for him. )Tj
T*(On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would "try to knock )Tj
T*(you another homer, maybe two today".[46] Differing newspaper reports from )Tj

T*( [edit] Game 5 )Tj
T*( Game¬†5, played at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis on October 7, featured a )Tj
T*(rematch between Game¬†1 starters Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel. Pennock had )Tj
T*(pitched a complete game three-hitter in the 2‚Äì1 Yankees victory, while Sherdel )Tj
T*(had pitched seven innings, giving up two runs and six hits.[23] )Tj
T*( Through the first three innings of the fourth game, both pitchers held the )Tj
T*(opposing team to no runs and a limited number of hits. In the bottom of the )Tj
T*(fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim )Tj
T*(Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les )Tj
T*(Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then )Tj
T*(hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while )Tj
T*(attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a )Tj
T*(line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell )Tj
T*(threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a )Tj
T*(considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his )Tj
T*(tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees )Tj
T*(leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second )Tj
T*(base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, )Tj
T*(and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed )Tj
T*(by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs )Tj
T*(promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for )Tj
T*(Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder )Tj
T*(Wattie Holm.[49] )Tj
T*( The Cardinals came back to take the lead in the bottom of the seventh inning. )Tj
T*(Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, )Tj
T*(O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to )Tj
T*(home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2‚Äì1 advantage. In the top of the )Tj
T*(ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left )Tj
T*(field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, advancing Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal )Tj
T*(went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring )Tj
T*(Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, )Tj
T*(and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on )Tj
T*(Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to )Tj
T*(shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on )Tj
T*(Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded )Tj
T*(to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals )Tj
T*(could not break the 2‚Äì2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went )Tj
T*(into extra innings.[49] )Tj
T*( The Yankees immediately took advantage of Sherdel in the top of the tenth )Tj
T*(inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild )Tj
T*(pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel )Tj
T*(followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at )Tj
T*(first, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. )Tj
T*(Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to )Tj
T*(left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the )Tj
T*(Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was )Tj
T*(hit by a pitch from Sherdel. With the bases loaded again, Severeid popped up to )Tj
T*(second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a )Tj
T*(single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not )Tj
T*(score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3‚Äì2. Both )Tj
T*(Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine )Tj

T*(Cleveland Alexander and Bob Shawkey, both of whom had made appearances in )Tj
T*(previous games in the series. Shawkey had come in as relief in Games 2 and 3, )Tj
T*(while Alexander had pitched a complete game against the Yankees in the )Tj
T*(Cardinals' Game¬†2 victory.[27] In the 1926 season, Shawkey had made most of his )Tj
T*(pitching appearances in relief, and had been an occasional starter on the )Tj
T*(Yankees rotation. He started 10 of his 29 total pitching appearances and posted )Tj
T*(an 8‚Äì7 record with a 3.62 earned run average.[50] )Tj
T*( The game was lopsided from the start. In the top of the first inning, Shawkey )Tj
T*(gave up three runs on three hits, with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley )Tj
T*(double and Les Bell single. Alexander encountered a minor setback in the fourth )Tj
T*(inning. To open up the bottom of the inning, Bob Meusel launched a triple into )Tj
T*(left field and scored on the following ground out by Lou Gehrig. Alexander shut )Tj
T*(down the Yankees for the rest of the inning, and the Cardinals held on to a 3‚Äì1 )Tj
T*(lead. In the top of the fifth inning, the Cardinals expanded their two-run )Tj
T*(lead. Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth. Alexander laid )Tj
T*(down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig, but was )Tj
T*(successful in advancing Thevenow to second base. Wattie Holm, substituting for )Tj
T*(Taylor Douthit as center fielder, followed by hitting a single into center )Tj
T*(field, scoring Thevenow on the play. Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby )Tj
T*(followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning.[51] )Tj
T*( The Cardinals scored again in the top of the seventh inning. Thevenow again )Tj
T*(led the inning by hitting a single into left field. Alexander bunted right in )Tj
T*(front of the plate. Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second )Tj
T*(baseman Tony Lazzeri, but Lazzeri made an error on the play, and both runners )Tj
T*(were safe at their respective bases. Holm followed by hitting a weak grounder )Tj
T*(that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base. With runners at first and )Tj
T*(second base, Southworth lined a double right by Ruth, scoring Alexander and )Tj
T*(sending Holm to third base. Urban Shocker, the starter in Game¬†2, then came in )Tj
T*(to relieve Shawkey as pitcher. Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center )Tj
T*(field, allowing Holm and Southworth to score. Bottomley then hit a grounder to )Tj
T*(shortstop Mark Koenig, who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out on the )Tj
T*(force play. Bell followed with a two-run home run, extending the Cardinals' )Tj
T*(lead to 9‚Äì1. Chick Hafey lined a double into left field, but Bob O'Farrell )Tj
T*(ended the inning by striking out. In the bottom of the seventh inning, the )Tj
T*(Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals' lead to )Tj
T*(seven runs.[51] )Tj
T*( In the eighth inning, Myles Thomas came in to relieve Shocker, who had given )Tj
T*(up three hits and two unearned runs in less than an inning of work. Meanwhile, )Tj
T*(Alexander shut down the Yankees offense for the rest of the game. In the top of )Tj
T*(the ninth inning, the Cardinals increased their lead back to eight runs after )Tj
T*(Hornsby had an RBI groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his )Tj
T*(second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, )Tj
T*(while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up )Tj
T*(thirteen hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.[51] )Tj
T*( [edit] Game 7 )Tj
T*( The deciding Game¬†7 was played on October 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium in front )Tj

T*(Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to )Tj
T*(tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a )Tj
T*(two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Haines struck out the next batter, and )Tj
T*(Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base.[52] All three runs in the )Tj
T*(inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors. )Tj
T*( In the sixth inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals lead. With two outs, Joe )Tj
T*(Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid followed with a double, scoring Dugan, before )Tj
T*(pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game¬†1 and 5 )Tj
T*(winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded )Tj
T*(only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3‚Äì2 lead. In the )Tj
T*(bottom half of the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, )Tj
T*(Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had )Tj
T*(developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the )Tj
T*(game.[53]\(p118\) )Tj
T*( Rogers Hornsby had to determine who he would put in to replace Haines as )Tj
T*(pitcher. Although Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a complete game the )Tj
T*(day before and may have spent the night drinking,[54] Hornsby decided to trust )Tj
T*(him after Alexander said he "had it in easy in there" in Game¬†6[53]\(p118\) and )Tj
T*(would be ready whenever Hornsby needed him. The first two pitches thrown by )Tj
T*(Alexander to batter Tony Lazzeri went for a strike and a ball, respectively. On )Tj
T*(the third pitch, Lazzeri hit a fly ball down the left field line. The ball )Tj
T*(initially appeared to be going into the stands for a grand slam, but at the )Tj
T*(last minute, it curved several feet into the stands in foul )Tj
T*(territory.[53]\(p119\) Alexander then threw a fastball that Lazzeri swung late at )Tj
T*(and missed for strike three, ending the inning and the Yankees' threat. )Tj
T*( Alexander retired the Yankees in order in the eighth inning. The Cardinals did )Tj
T*(nothing offensively in the top of the ninth inning, so it was up to Alexander )Tj
T*(to preserve the Cardinals' game in the bottom of the ninth.[53]\(p119\) Alexander )Tj
T*(got the first two batters of the inning, Combs and Dugan, to ground out to )Tj
T*(third baseman Bell. With two outs and no runners on base, Alexander faced Ruth. )Tj
T*(Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game. Manager )Tj
T*(Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander. Alexander told Hornsby that )Tj
T*(he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him. Alexander's first pitch )Tj
T*(to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate. Alexander's next )Tj
T*(pitch fell outside of the strike zone for ball one. Ruth then fouled the next )Tj
T*(pitch, making the count one ball and two strikes. Alexander's next two pitches )Tj
T*(fell too low for balls two and three, making it a full count.[35]\(p37\) The )Tj
T*(following full count pitch was noted by New York Herald Tribune sportswriter W. )Tj
T*(O. McGeehan: "The count went to three and two, Ruth was swaying eagerly. The )Tj
T*(soupbone creaked again. The ball seemed a fraction of an inch from being a )Tj
T*(strike. Ruth paused a moment. Even he was uncertain. Then he trotted down to )Tj
T*(first."[53]\(p119\) )Tj
T*( With two outs and Ruth at first base, left fielder Bob Meusel came up to the )Tj
T*(plate. Meusel was a .315 hitter that year and had batted in 81¬†runs in just )Tj
T*(over 100 regular season games. Meusel also had success in Game¬†6 against )Tj
T*(Alexander, with a double and triple.[53]\(p119\) Just as Meusel was about to take )Tj
T*(his first pitch, Ruth made the bold move of trying to steal second base. Ruth )Tj
T*(was known as a good but overly aggressive baserunner, with about a 50% success )Tj
T*(rate at stealing bases in his career, and his attempt surprised many people )Tj
T*(throughout the stadium.[7]\(p80\) Meusel swung and missed at the pitch, and )Tj
T*(Cardinals catcher Bob O'Farrell immediately threw the ball to second baseman )Tj
T*(Hornsby. Hornsby reached for the ball, and laid the tag immediately on Ruth. )Tj
T*(Ruth was out by a good 10 feet \(3.0¬†m\), and the game was over. As the game )Tj

T*(steal second and is put out catcher to second!"[44]\(p340\) )Tj
T*( As Hornsby recalled later, Ruth "didn't say a word. He didn't even look around )Tj
T*(or up at me. He just picked himself up and walked away".[53]\(p119\) Ruth's )Tj

T*( Tosca \(Italian pronunciation:¬†[Ààt…îska]\) is an opera in three acts by Giacomo )Tj
T*(Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It )Tj
T*(premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on )Tj
T*(Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a )Tj
T*(melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's )Tj
T*(control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains )Tj
T*(depictions of torture, murder and suicide, yet also includes some of Puccini's )Tj
T*(best-known lyrical arias, and has inspired memorable performances from many of )Tj
T*(opera's leading singers. )Tj
T*( Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some )Tj
T*(vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. )Tj
T*(Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, )Tj
T*(during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. )Tj
T*(Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was )Tj
T*(delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from )Tj
T*(the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. )Tj
T*( Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, )Tj
T*(recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. )Tj
T*(Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs \(short musical statements\) to identify )Tj
T*(characters, objects and ideas. While critics have frequently dismissed the )Tj
T*(opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot‚Äîmusicologist Joseph Kerman )Tj
T*(famously called it a "shabby little shocker"‚Äîthe power of its score and the )Tj
T*(inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic )Tj
T*(force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and )Tj
T*(audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. )Tj
T*(Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live )Tj
T*(performances. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of )Tj
T*(them successful, and none of them performed today.[1] In the early 1880s Sardou )Tj
T*(began a collaboration with the immensely popular actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom )Tj
T*(he provided with a series of historical melodramas.[2] He reached his greatest )Tj
T*(glory with the third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24¬†)Tj
T*(November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe.[3] The play was an )Tj
T*(outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.[4] )Tj
T*( Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7¬†May 1889 he )Tj
T*(wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission )Tj
T*(for the work to be made into an opera: "I see in this Tosca the opera I need, )Tj
T*(with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the )Tj
T*(usual excessive amount of music."[5] Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele )Tj
T*(Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a )Tj
T*(French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in )Tj
T*(Italy, particularly in Milan, and also warned that other composers were )Tj
T*(interested in the piece.[6] Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou, and )Tj
T*(assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.[7] )Tj
T*(In 1891, however, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely )Tj
T*(because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical )Tj

T*(form.[8] When Sardou indicated his unease at entrusting his most successful )Tj
T*(work to the as-yet-unproven Puccini, whose music he did not like, Puccini took )Tj
T*(offence. He withdrew from the agreement,[9] which Ricordi then assigned to )Tj
T*(Alberto Franchetti.[7] )Tj
T*( Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti who, however, was never at ease with )Tj
T*(the assignment. There are several versions of how Ricordi got Franchetti to )Tj
T*(surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini, who had again become )Tj
T*(interested.[10] By some accounts, Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work )Tj
T*(was too violent to be successfully staged. Franchetti family tradition holds )Tj
T*(that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand gesture, "He has more talent than )Tj
T*(I do."[7] American scholar Deborah Burton contends that Franchetti gave it up )Tj
T*(simply because he saw little merit in it and could not feel the music in the )Tj
T*(play.[7] Franchetti surrendered the rights in May 1895, and in August Puccini )Tj
T*(signed a contract to resume control of the project.[10] )Tj

T*( [edit] Historical context )Tj
T*( According to the libretto, the action of Tosca occurs in Rome in June )Tj
T*(1800.[13] Sardou, in his play, dates it more precisely; La Tosca takes place in )Tj
T*(the afternoon, evening, and early morning of 17 and 18¬†June 1800.[14] )Tj
T*( Italy had long been divided into a number of small states, with the Pope in )Tj
T*(Rome ruling the Papal States in the area of central Italy. Following the French )Tj
T*(Revolution, a French army under Napoleon invaded Italy in 1796, entering Rome )Tj
T*(almost unopposed on 11¬†February 1798 and establishing a republic there.[15] )Tj
T*(This republic was ruled by seven consuls; in the opera this is the former )Tj
T*(office of Angelotti, whose character may be based on the real-life consul )Tj
T*(Libero Angelucci.[16] In September 1799 the French, who had protected the )Tj
T*(republic, withdrew from Rome.[17] As they left, troops of the Kingdom of Naples )Tj
T*(occupied the city.[18] )Tj

T*( In May 1800 Napoleon, by then the unquestioned leader of France, brought his )Tj
T*(troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14¬†June his army met the )Tj
T*(Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo \(near Alessandria\). Austrian troops )Tj
T*(were initially successful; by mid-morning they were in control of the field of )Tj
T*(battle, and their commander, Michael von Melas sent this news south towards )Tj
T*(Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived in late afternoon, and Napoleon )Tj
T*(attacked the tired Austrians. As Melas retreated in disarray with the remains )Tj
T*(of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message.[19] The )Tj
T*(Neapolitans abandoned Rome,[20] and the city spent the next fourteen years )Tj
T*(under French domination.[21] )Tj
T*( Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle )Tj
T*( Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped )Tj
T*(political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private )Tj
T*(chapel ‚Äî his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel )Tj
T*(hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters )Tj
T*(and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The )Tj
T*(painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary )Tj
T*(Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a )Tj
T*(blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently \(unknown to him, )Tj
T*(it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa\). Cavaradossi describes the "hidden )Tj
T*(harmony" \("Recondita armonia"\) in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his )Tj
T*(painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan )Tj
T*(mumbles his disapproval before leaving. )Tj
T*( Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican )Tj
T*(sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. )Tj
T*(Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, )Tj
T*(calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and )Tj
T*(Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously )Tj
T*(asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing ‚Äî she thinks that he has been talking )Tj
T*(to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to )Tj
T*(take her to his villa that evening: "Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta" \("Do )Tj
T*(you not long for our little villa"\). She then expresses jealousy over the woman )Tj
T*(in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi )Tj
T*(explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the )Tj
T*(church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more )Tj
T*(beautiful than her own: "Qual'occhio al mondo" \("What eyes in the world"\). )Tj
T*(After Tosca has gone, Angelotti reappears, and discusses with the painter his )Tj
T*(plan to flee disguised as a woman, using clothes left in the chapel by his )Tj
T*(sister. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti a key to his villa, suggesting that he hide )Tj
T*(in a disused well in the garden. )Tj
T*( The sound of a cannon signals that Angelotti's escape has been discovered. As )Tj
T*(he and Cavaradossi rapidly leave the church the Sacristan re-enters with )Tj
T*(choristers, celebrating the news that Napoleon has apparently been defeated at )Tj
T*(Marengo. The celebrations cease abruptly with the entry of Scarpia, his )Tj
T*(henchman Spoletta and several police agents, who are searching for Angelotti. )Tj
T*(They have heard that he has sought refuge in the church. A search is ordered, )Tj
T*(and the empty food basket and a fan bearing the Attavanti coat of arms are )Tj
T*(found in the chapel. Scarpia questions the Sacristan, and his suspicions are )Tj
T*(aroused further when he learns that Cavaradossi has been in the church; Scarpia )Tj
T*(mistrusts the painter, and believes him complicit in Angelotti's escape. When )Tj
T*(Tosca arrives looking for her lover, Scarpia artfully arouses her jealous )Tj
T*(instincts by implying a relationship between the painter and the Marchesa )Tj
T*(Attavanti. He draws Tosca's attention to the fan and suggests that someone must )Tj
T*(have surprised the lovers in the chapel. Tosca falls for his deceit; enraged, )Tj
T*(she rushes off to confront Cavaradossi. Scarpia orders Spoletta and his agents )Tj
T*(to follow her, assuming she will lead them to Cavaradossi and Angelotti. He )Tj
T*(privately gloats as he reveals his intentions to possess Tosca and execute )Tj
T*(Cavaradossi. A procession enters the church singing the Te Deum; exclaiming )Tj
T*('Tosca, you make me forget even God!', Scarpia joins the chorus in the prayer. )Tj

T*(that she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's )Tj

T*(tells Scarpia that Angelotti is in the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's )Tj
T*(villa. )Tj
T*( Scarpia orders the torture of Cavaradossi to cease and the wounded painter is )Tj

T*(victory at Marengo; Cavaradossi gloats, telling Scarpia that his rule of terror )Tj
T*(will soon be at an end, before being dragged away by Scarpia's men. Scarpia, )Tj
T*(left with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi )Tj
T*(will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances. Outside )Tj
T*(she hears the drums that announce an execution; as Scarpia awaits her decision, )Tj
T*(she prays to God for help, asking why He has abandoned her: "Vissi d'arte" \("I )Tj
T*(lived for art"\). Scarpia remains adamant despite her pleas. When Spoletta )Tj
T*(brings news that Angelotti has killed himself and that everything is in place )Tj
T*(for Cavaradossi's execution, Tosca, in despair, agrees to submit to Scarpia in )Tj
T*(return for Cavaradossi's freedom. Scarpia tells his deputy Spoletta to arrange )Tj
T*(a mock execution, both recalling that it will be "as we did with Count )Tj
T*(Palmieri". )Tj
T*( Following Spoletta's departure, Tosca imposes the further condition that )Tj
T*(Scarpia provide a safe-conduct out of Rome for herself and her lover. While he )Tj

T*(Scarpia triumphantly embraces her, she stabs him, crying "this is Tosca's )Tj

T*(permission to write a letter to Tosca. He begins to write, but is soon )Tj
T*(overwhelmed by memories: "E lucevan le stelle" \("And the stars shone"\). Tosca )Tj
T*(enters and shows him the safe-conduct. She tells him that she has killed )Tj
T*(Scarpia and that the imminent execution is a sham: Cavaradossi must feign )Tj
T*(death, but afterwards they can leave Rome together, before Scarpia's body is )Tj
T*(discovered. Cavaradossi is amazed at the courage shown by one so gentle and )Tj
T*(tender: "O dolci mani" \("Oh sweet hands"\). The pair ecstatically plan the life )Tj
T*(they will live away from Rome. Tosca then anxiously instructs Cavaradossi on )Tj
T*(how to play his part in the mock execution convincingly. She tells him that he )Tj
T*(will be shot with blanks by the firing squad and instructs him to fall down as )Tj
T*(if dead. He agrees to act "like Tosca in the theatre". )Tj
T*( Cavaradossi is led away, and Tosca watches with increasing impatience as the )Tj

T*(exposition. While the broad details of the play are present in the opera's )Tj
T*(plot, the original work contains many more characters and much detail not )Tj
T*(present in the opera. In the play the lovers are portrayed as though they were )Tj
T*(French: the character Floria Tosca is closely modelled on Bernhardt's )Tj
T*(personality, while her lover Cavaradossi, of Roman descent, is born in Paris. )Tj
T*(Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the playwright who joined the project to polish )Tj
T*(the verses, needed not only to cut back the play drastically, but to make the )Tj
T*(characters' motivations and actions suitable for Italian opera.[22] Giacosa and )Tj
T*(Puccini repeatedly clashed over the condensation, with Giacosa feeling that )Tj
T*(Puccini did not really want to complete the project.[23] )Tj
T*( The first draft libretto that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 )Tj
T*(after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences from the )Tj
T*(final libretto, relatively minor in the first two acts but much more )Tj
T*(appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens )Tj
T*(the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual "E )Tj
T*(lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a )Tj
T*(different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the )Tj
T*(final scene, she cradles her lover's head in her lap and hallucinates that she )Tj
T*(and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for )Tj
T*(silence.[24] Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the )Tj
T*(play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death.[25] Puccini )Tj
T*(agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences )Tj
T*(anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed )Tj
T*(his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to )Tj
T*(abandon the work.[26] The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini )Tj
T*(what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.[27] )Tj
T*( Little work was done on the score during 1897, which Puccini devoted mostly to )Tj
T*(performances of La boh√®me.[27] The opening page of the autograph Tosca score, )Tj
T*(containing the motif that would be associated with Scarpia, is dated January )Tj
T*(1898.[28] At Puccini's request, Giacosa irritably provided new lyrics for the )Tj
T*(act 1 love duet. In August, Puccini removed several numbers from the opera, )Tj
T*(according to his biographer, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, "cut[ting] Tosca to the )Tj
T*(bone, leaving three strong characters trapped in an airless, violent, tightly )Tj
T*(wound melodrama that had little room for lyricism".[29] At the end of the year, )Tj
T*(Puccini wrote that he was "busting his balls" on the opera.[29] )Tj
T*( Puccini asked clerical friends for words for the congregation to mutter at the )Tj
T*(start of the act 1 Te Deum; when nothing they provided satisfied him, he )Tj
T*(supplied the words himself.[29] For the Te Deum music, he investigated the )Tj
T*(melodies to which the hymn was set in Roman churches, and sought to reproduce )Tj
T*(the cardinal's procession authentically, even to the uniforms of the Swiss )Tj
T*(Guards.[26] He adapted the music to the exact pitch of the great bell of St. )Tj
T*(Peter's Basilica,[30] and was equally diligent when writing the music that )Tj
T*(opens act 3, in which Rome awakens to the sounds of church bells.[30] He )Tj
T*(journeyed to Rome and went to the Castel Sant'Angelo to measure the sound of )Tj
T*(matins bells there, as they would be heard from its ramparts.[26] Puccini had )Tj
T*(bells for the Roman dawn cast to order by four different foundries.[31] This )Tj
T*(apparently did not have its desired effect, as Illica wrote to Ricordi on the )Tj
T*(day after the premiere, "the great fuss and the large amount of money for the )Tj
T*(bells have constituted an additional folly, because it passes completely )Tj
T*(unnoticed".[32] Nevertheless, the bells provide a source of trouble and expense )Tj
T*(to opera companies performing Tosca to this day.[25] )Tj
T*( In act 2, when Tosca sings offstage the cantata that celebrates the supposed )Tj
T*(defeat of Napoleon, Puccini was tempted to follow the text of Sardou's play and )Tj
T*(use the music of Giovanni Paisiello, before finally writing his own imitation )Tj
T*(of Paisello's style.[33] It was not until 29¬†September 1899 that Puccini was )Tj
T*(able to mark the final page of the score as completed. Despite the notation, )Tj
T*(there was additional work to be done,[34] such as the shepherd boy's song at )Tj
T*(the start of act 3. Puccini, who always sought to put local colour in his )Tj
T*(works, wanted that song to be in Roman dialect. The composer asked a friend to )Tj

T*(folklorist, Luigi "Giggi" Zanazzo wrote the verse which, after slight )Tj
T*(modification, was placed in the opera.[34] )Tj
T*( In October 1899, Ricordi realized that some of the music for Cavaradossi's act )Tj
T*(3 aria, "O dolci mani" was borrowed from music Puccini had cut from his early )Tj
T*(opera, Edgar and demanded changes. Puccini defended his music as expressive of )Tj
T*(what Cavaradossi must be feeling at that point, and offered to come to Milan to )Tj
T*(play and sing act 3 for the publisher.[35] Ricordi was overwhelmed by the )Tj
T*(completed act 3 prelude, which he received in early November, and softened his )Tj
T*(views, though he was still not completely happy with the music for "O dolci )Tj
T*(mani".[36] In any event time was too short before the scheduled January 1900 )Tj
T*(premiere to make any further changes.[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception and performance history )Tj
T*( [edit] Premiere )Tj
T*( By December 1899, Tosca was in rehearsal at the Teatro Costanzi.[38] Because )Tj
T*(of the Roman setting, Ricordi arranged a Roman premiere for the opera,[26] even )Tj
T*(though this meant that Arturo Toscanini could not conduct it as Puccini had )Tj
T*(hoped‚ÄîToscanini was fully engaged at La Scala in Milan. Leopoldo Mugnone was )Tj
T*(appointed to conduct. The accomplished \(but temperamental\) soprano Hariclea )Tj
T*(Darcl√©e was selected for the title role; Eugenio Giraldoni, whose father had )Tj
T*(originated multiple Verdi roles, became the first Scarpia. The young Enrico )Tj
T*(Caruso had hoped to create Cavaradossi, but was passed over in favour of the )Tj
T*(more experienced Emilio De Marchi.[38] The performance was to be directed by )Tj
T*(Nino Vignuzzi, with stage designs by Adolfo Hohenstein.[39] )Tj
T*( At the time of the premiere, Italy had experienced political and social unrest )Tj
T*(for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the )Tj
T*(religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other )Tj
T*(anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, )Tj
T*(and instructed Mugnone \(who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona\),[40] )Tj
T*(that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march.[41] The unrest caused )Tj
T*(the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14¬†January.[42] )Tj
T*( By 1900, the premiere of a Puccini opera was a national event.[41] Many Roman )Tj
T*(dignitaries attended, as did Queen Margherita, though she arrived late, after )Tj
T*(the first act.[40] The Prime Minister of Italy, Luigi Pelloux was present, with )Tj
T*(several members of his cabinet.[42] A number of Puccini's operatic rivals were )Tj
T*(there, including Franchetti, Pietro Mascagni, Francesco Cilea and Ildebrando )Tj
T*(Pizzetti. Shortly after the curtain was raised there was a disturbance in the )Tj
T*(back of the theatre, caused by latecomers attempting to enter the auditorium, )Tj
T*(and a shout of "Bring down the curtain!", at which Mugnone stopped the )Tj
T*(orchestra.[40] A few moments later the opera began again, and proceeded without )Tj
T*(further disturbance.[40] )Tj
T*( The performance, while not quite the triumph that Puccini had hoped for, was )Tj
T*(generally successful, with numerous encores.[40] Much of the critical and press )Tj
T*(reaction was lukewarm, often blaming Illica's libretto. In response, Illica )Tj
T*(condemned Puccini for treating his librettists "like stagehands" and reducing )Tj
T*(the text to a shadow of its original form.[43] Nevertheless, any public doubts )Tj
T*(about Tosca soon vanished; the premiere was followed by twenty performances, )Tj
T*(all given to packed houses.[44] )Tj
T*( [edit] Subsequent productions )Tj
T*( The Milan premiere at La Scala took place under Toscanini on 17¬†March 1900. )Tj
T*(Darcl√©e and Giraldoni reprised their roles; the prominent tenor Giuseppe )Tj
T*(Borgatti replaced De Marchi as Cavaradossi. The opera was a great success at La )Tj
T*(Scala, and played to full houses.[45] Puccini travelled to London for the )Tj
T*(British premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 11¬†July, with )Tj
T*(Milka Ternina and Fernando De Lucia as the doomed lovers and Antonio Scotti as )Tj
T*(Scarpia. Puccini wrote that Tosca was "[a] complete triumph", and Ricordi's )Tj
T*(London representative quickly signed a contract to take Tosca to New York. The )Tj
T*(premiere at the Metropolitan Opera \(the "Met"\) was on 4¬†February 1901, with De )Tj
T*(Lucia's replacement by Giuseppe Cremonini the only change from the London )Tj
T*(cast.[46] For its French premiere at the Op√©ra-Comique on 13¬†October 1903, the )Tj

T*(delighted with the public's reception of the work in Paris, despite adverse )Tj
T*(comments from critics. The opera was subsequently premiered at venues )Tj
T*(throughout Europe, the Americas, Australia and the Far East;[47] by the )Tj
T*(outbreak of war in 1914 it had been performed in more than 50 cities )Tj
T*(worldwide.[11] )Tj
T*( Among the prominent early Toscas was Emmy Destinn, who sang the role regularly )Tj
T*(in a long-standing partnership with the tenor Enrico Caruso.[48]Maria Jeritza, )Tj
T*(over many years at the Met and in Vienna, brought her own distinctive style to )Tj
T*(the role, and was said to be Puccini's ideal Tosca.[49] Jeritza was the first )Tj
T*(to deliver "Vissi d'arte" from a prone position, having fallen to the stage )Tj
T*(while eluding the grasp of Scarpia. This was a great success, and Jeritza sang )Tj
T*(the aria lying down thereafter.[50] Of her successors, opera enthusiasts tend )Tj
T*(to consider Maria Callas as the supreme interpreter of the role, largely on the )Tj
T*(basis of her performances at the Royal Opera House in 1964, with Tito Gobbi as )Tj
T*(Scarpia.[49] This production, by Franco Zeffirelli, remained in continuous use )Tj
T*(at Covent Garden for more than 40 years until replaced in 2006 by a new )Tj
T*(staging, which premiered with Angela Gheorghiu. Callas had first sung Tosca at )Tj
T*(age¬†18 in a performance given in Greek, in Athens on 27¬†August 1942.[51] Tosca )Tj
T*(was also her last on-stage operatic role, in a special charity performance at )Tj
T*(the Royal Opera House on 7¬†May 1965.[52] )Tj
T*( Among non-traditional productions, in 1996 at La Scala Luca Ronconi used )Tj
T*(distorted and fractured scenery to represent the twists of fate reflected in )Tj
T*(the plot.[49]Jonathan Miller, in a 1986 production for the 49th Maggio Musicale )Tj
T*(Fiorentino, transferred the action to Nazi-occupied Rome in 1944, with Scarpia )Tj
T*(as head of the fascist police.[53] In Philipp Himmelmann's production on the )Tj
T*(Lake Stage at the Bregenz Festival in 2007 the act 1 set, designed by Johannes )Tj
T*(Leiacker, was dominated by a huge Orwellian "Big Brother" eye. The iris opens )Tj
T*(and closes to reveal surreal scenes beyond the action. This production updates )Tj
T*(the story to a modern Mafia scenario, with special effects "worthy of a Bond )Tj
T*(film".[54] )Tj
T*( In 1992 a television version of the opera was filmed at the locations )Tj
T*(prescribed by Puccini, at the times of day at which each act takes place. )Tj
T*(Featuring Catherine Malfitano, Pl√°cido Domingo and Ruggero Raimondi, the )Tj
T*(performance was broadcast live throughout Europe.[55]Luciano Pavarotti, who )Tj
T*(sang Cavaradossi from the late 1970s, appeared in a special performance in Rome )Tj
T*(on 14¬†January 2000, to celebrate the opera's centenary with Domingo as )Tj
T*(conductor. Pavarotti's last stage performance was as Cavaradossi at the Met, on )Tj
T*(13¬†March 2004.[56] )Tj
T*( Early Cavaradossis played the part as if the painter believed that he was )Tj
T*(reprieved, and would survive the "mock" execution. Beniamino Gigli, who )Tj
T*(performed the role many times in his forty-year operatic career, was one of the )Tj
T*(first to assume that the painter knows, or strongly suspects, that he will be )Tj
T*(shot. Gigli wrote in his autobiography: "he is certain that these are their )Tj
T*(last moments together on earth, and that he is about to die".[57] Domingo, the )Tj
T*(dominant Cavaradossi of the 1970s and 1980s, concurred, stating in a 1985 )Tj
T*(interview that he had long played the part that way.[57] Gobbi, who in his )Tj
T*(later years often directed the opera, commented, "Unlike Floria, Cavaradossi )Tj
T*(knows that Scarpia never yields, though he pretends to believe in order to )Tj
T*(delay the pain for Tosca."[57] )Tj
T*( [edit] Critical reception )Tj
T*( The enduring popularity of Tosca has not been matched by consistent critical )Tj
T*(enthusiasm. After the premiere, Ippolito Valetta of Nueva antologia wrote, )Tj
T*("[Puccini] finds in his palette all colours, all shades; in his hands, the )Tj
T*(instrumental texture becomes completely supple, the gradations of sonority are )Tj
T*(innumerable, the blend unfailingly grateful to the ear."[44] However, one )Tj
T*(critic described act¬†2 as overly long and wordy; another echoed Illica and )Tj
T*(Giacosa in stating that the rush of action did not permit enough lyricism, to )Tj
T*(the great detriment of the music. A third called the opera "three hours of )Tj
T*(noise".[58] )Tj

T*(Times called Puccini "a master in the art of poignant expression", and praised )Tj
T*(the "wonderful skill and sustained power" of the music.[59] In The Musical )Tj
T*(Times, Puccini's score was admired for its sincerity and "strength of )Tj
T*(utterance."[60] However, after the 1903 Paris opening, the composer Paul Dukas )Tj
T*(thought the work lacked cohesion and style, while Gabriel Faur√© was offended by )Tj
T*("disconcerting vulgarities".[61] More recently the musicologist Joseph Kerman )Tj
T*(described Tosca as a "shabby little shocker",[62] while the composer Benjamin )Tj
T*(Britten declared that he was "sickened by the cheapness and emptiness" of )Tj
T*(Puccini's music.[63] Veteran critic Ernest Newman, while acknowledging the )Tj
T*("enormously difficult business of boiling [Sardou's] play down for operatic )Tj
T*(purposes,"[64] writes that the subtleties of Sardou's original plot are handled )Tj
T*("very lamely", so that "much of what happens, and why, is unintelligible to the )Tj
T*(spectator".[65] Overall, however, Newman delivers a more positive judgement: )Tj
T*("[Puccini's] operas are to some extent a mere bundle of tricks, but no one else )Tj
T*(has performed the same tricks nearly as well".[66] Opera scholar Julian Budden )Tj
T*(remarks on Puccini's "inept handling of the political element", but still hails )Tj
T*(the work as "a triumph of pure theatre".[67] Music critic Charles Osborne )Tj
T*(ascribes Tosca's immense popularity with audiences to the taut effectiveness of )Tj
T*(its melodramatic plot, the opportunities given to its three leading characters )Tj
T*(to shine vocally and dramatically, and the presence of two great arias in )Tj
T*("Vissi d'arte" and "E lucevan le stelle".[63] The work remains popular today; )Tj
T*(it was the second-most performed opera in North America in 2008/2009, surpassed )Tj
T*(only by Puccini's La boh√®me.[68] )Tj
T*( [edit] General style )Tj
T*( By the end of the 19th century the classic form of opera structure, in which )Tj
T*(arias, duets and other set-piece vocal numbers are interspersed with passages )Tj
T*(of recitative or dialogue, had been largely abandoned, even in Italy. Operas )Tj
T*(were "through-composed", with a continuous stream of music which in some cases )Tj
T*(eliminated all identifiable set-pieces. In what critic Edward Greenfield calls )Tj
T*(the "Grand Tune" concept, Puccini retains a limited number of set-pieces, )Tj
T*(distinguished from their musical surroundings by their memorable melodies. Even )Tj
T*(in the passages linking these "Grand Tunes", Puccini maintains a strong degree )Tj
T*(of lyricism and only rarely resorts to recitative.[69] )Tj
T*( Budden describes Tosca as the most Wagnerian of Puccini's scores, in its use )Tj
T*(of musical leitmotifs. Unlike Wagner, Puccini does not develop or modify his )Tj
T*(motifs, nor weave them into the music symphonically, but uses them to refer to )Tj
T*(characters, objects and ideas, and as reminders within the narrative.[70] The )Tj
T*(most potent of these motifs is the sequence of three very loud and strident )Tj
T*(chords which open the opera and which represent the evil character of )Tj
T*(Scarpia‚Äîor perhaps, Charles Osborne proposes, the violent atmosphere that )Tj
T*(pervades the entire opera.[71] Budden has suggested that Scarpia's tyranny, )Tj
T*(lechery and lust form "the dynamic engine that ignites the drama".[72] Other )Tj
T*(motifs identify Tosca herself, the love of Tosca and Cavaradossi, the fugitive )Tj
T*(Angelotti, the semi-comical character of the sacristan in act 1 and the theme )Tj
T*(of torture in act 2.[72][73] )Tj
T*( The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif )Tj
T*(lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of )Tj
T*(the "fugitive" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo )Tj
T*(theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with )Tj
T*(Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance. This leads to the first )Tj
T*(of the "Grand Tunes", Cavaradossi's "Recondita armonia" with its sustained high )Tj
T*(B flat, accompanied by the sacristan's grumbling counter-melody.[71] The )Tj
T*(domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet )Tj
T*(make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, )Tj
T*(Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work.[74] Cavaradossi's dialogue with )Tj
T*(Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which )Tj
T*(incorporates, in Newman's words, "the feline, caressing cadence so )Tj
T*(characteristic of her."[75] Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the )Tj
T*(music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no )Tj
T*(contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover )Tj

T*(does not take too seriously.[76] )Tj
T*( After Tosca's "Non la sospiri" and the subsequent argument inspired by her )Tj
T*(jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet "Qual'occhio" provides what )Tj
T*(opera writer Burton Fisher describes as "an almost erotic lyricism that has )Tj
T*(been called pornophony".[77] The brief scene in which the sacristan returns )Tj
T*(with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the )Tj
T*(last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his )Tj
T*(menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker.[33] As the )Tj
T*(police chief interrogates the sacristan, the "fugitive" motif recurs three more )Tj
T*(times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his )Tj
T*(investigation.[78] In Scarpia's exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling )Tj
T*(bells, interwoven with the orchestra, creates an almost religious )Tj
T*(atmosphere,[33] for which Puccini draws on music from his then unpublished Mass )Tj
T*(of 1880.[79] The final scene in the act is a juxtaposition of the sacred and )Tj
T*(the profane,[73] as Scarpia's lustful reverie is sung alongside the swelling Te )Tj
T*(Deum chorus. He joins with the chorus in the final statement "Te aeternum )Tj
T*(Patrem omnis terra veneratur" \("Everlasting Father, all the earth worships )Tj
T*(thee"\), before the act ends with a thunderous restatement of the Scarpia )Tj
T*(motif.[73][80] )Tj

T*(Tosca, according to Newman, he rises to his greatest height as a master of the )Tj
T*(musical macabre.[81] The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the )Tj
T*(forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a )Tj
T*(gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music )Tj
T*(Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, )Tj
T*(Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him.[82] )Tj
T*(In the dialogue with Spoletta, the "torture" motif‚Äîan "ideogram of suffering", )Tj
T*(according to Budden‚Äîis heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to )Tj
T*(come.[33][83] As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is )Tj
T*(heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, "[its] suave strains )Tj
T*(contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening )Tj
T*(colour of the stage action".[84] The cantata is most likely the Cantata a )Tj
T*(Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.[82] )Tj
T*( Osborne describes the scenes that follow‚ÄîCavaradossi's interrogation, his )Tj
T*(torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca‚Äîas Puccini's musical equivalent )Tj
T*(of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief "Vittoria! Vittoria!" on the news )Tj
T*(of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief.[85] Scarpia's aria "Gi√†, mi )Tj
T*(dicon venal" \("Yes, they say I am venal"\) is closely followed by Tosca's "Vissi )Tj
T*(d'arte". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the )Tj
T*(opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake;[86] he )Tj
T*(considered eliminating it since it held up the action.[87] Fisher calls it "a )Tj
T*(Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly )Tj
T*(and righteously".[73] In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil )Tj
T*(which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow )Tj
T*(movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.[88] After Tosca's contemptuous "E )Tj
T*(avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!" \("All Rome trembled before him"\), sung on a )Tj
T*(middle C‚ôØ monotone [89] \(sometimes spoken\),[85] the music gradually fades, )Tj
T*(ending "the most impressively macabre scene in all opera."[90] The final notes )Tj
T*(in the act are those of the Scarpia motif, softly, in a minor key.[91] )Tj
T*( The third act's tranquil beginning provides a brief respite from the drama. An )Tj
T*(introductory 16-bar theme for the horns will later be sung by Cavaradossi and )Tj
T*(Tosca in their final duet. The orchestral prelude which follows portrays the )Tj
T*(Roman dawn; the pastoral aura is accentuated by the shepherd boy's song, and )Tj
T*(the sounds of sheep bells and church bells, the authenticity of latter )Tj
T*(validated by Puccini's early morning visits to Rome.[77][85] Themes reminiscent )Tj
T*(of Scarpia, Tosca and Cavaradossi emerge in the music, which changes tone as )Tj
T*(the drama resumes with Cavaradossi's entrance, to an orchestral statement of )Tj
T*(what becomes the melody of his aria "E lucevan le stelle".[85] This is a )Tj
T*(farewell to love and life, "an anguished lament and grief built around the )Tj
T*(words 'muoio disperato' \(I die in despair\)".[92] Puccini insisted on the )Tj

T*(cause to be grateful to him: for composing the music, for having the lyrics )Tj
T*(written, and "for declining expert advice to throw the result in the )Tj
T*(waste-paper basket".[93] The lovers' final duet "Amaro sol per te", which )Tj
T*(concludes with the act's opening horn music, did not equate with Ricordi's idea )Tj
T*(of a transcendental love duet which would be a fitting climax to the opera. )Tj
T*(Puccini justified his musical treatment by citing Tosca's preoccupation with )Tj
T*(teaching Cavaradossi to feign death.[70] )Tj
T*( In the execution scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant )Tj
T*(repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates )Tj
T*(the two parts of act¬†1 in Wagner's Parsifal.[94] In the final bars, as Tosca )Tj
T*(evades Spoletta and leaps to her death, the theme of "E lucevan le stelle" is )Tj
T*(played tutta forze \(as loudly as possible\). This choice of ending has been )Tj
T*(strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association )Tj
T*(with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca.[67] Joseph Kerman mocked the final music, )Tj
T*("Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams the first thing that comes into its )Tj
T*(head."[95] Budden, however, argues that it is entirely logical to end this dark )Tj
T*(opera on its blackest theme.[67] According to historian and former opera singer )Tj
T*(Susan Vandiver Nicassio: "The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues )Tj
T*(gives the end of the opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected )Tj

T*( [edit] Recordings )Tj
T*( The first complete Tosca recording was made in 1919, using the pre-microphone )Tj
T*(acoustic process. The conductor, Carlo Sabajno, had been The Gramophone )Tj
T*(Company's house conductor since 1904; he had made recordings of Verdi's Ernani )Tj
T*(and Rigoletto before tackling Tosca with a young and largely unknown cast.[96] )Tj
T*(In 1929 Sabajno recorded the opera again, with the orchestra and chorus of the )Tj
T*(Teatro alla Scala and with star names Carmen Melis and Apollo Granforte in the )Tj
T*(roles of Tosca and Scarpia.[97] In 1938 HMV secured the services of the )Tj
T*(renowned tenor Beniamino Gigli for a "practically complete" recording that )Tj
T*(extended over 14 double-sided shellac discs.[98] )Tj
T*( In the post-war period, following the invention of long-playing records, Tosca )Tj
T*(recordings were dominated by Maria Callas. The earliest of her recordings in )Tj
T*(the role were of two live performances in Mexico City, in 1950 and 1952.[99] In )Tj
T*(1953, with conductor Victor de Sabata and the La Scala forces, she made the )Tj
T*(recording which for decades has been considered the best of all the recorded )Tj
T*(performances of the opera.[100][101] Callas made several more recordings, )Tj
T*(mainly of live stage performances, the last in 1965.[99] The first stereo )Tj
T*(recording of the opera was made in 1959, with Francesco Molinari-Pradelli )Tj
T*(conducting the Santa Cecilia orchestra and chorus with Renata Tebaldi as Tosca )Tj
T*(and Mario Del Monaco as Cavaradossi.[102]Herbert von Karajan's acclaimed )Tj
T*(performance with the Vienna State Opera was in 1963, with Leontyne Price, )Tj
T*(Giuseppe Di Stefano and Giuseppe Taddei in the leading roles.[100] )Tj
T*( The 1970s and 1980s saw a proliferation of recordings, many of live )Tj
T*(performances. Pl√°cido Domingo first recorded Cavaradossi in 1973, and continued )Tj
T*(to do so at regular intervals until 1994. In 1976 he was joined by his son, )Tj
T*(Pl√°cido Domingo Jr., who sang the shepherd boy's song in a British recording )Tj
T*(with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. More recent commended recordings have )Tj
T*(included Antonio Pappano's 2000 Royal Opera House version with Angela )Tj
T*(Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi.[100] Recordings of Tosca in )Tj
T*(languages other than Italian are rare but not unknown; over the years versions )Tj
T*(in French, German, Spanish, Hungarian and Russian have been issued.[99] An )Tj
T*(admired English language version was released in 1995 in which David Parry led )Tj
T*(the Philharmonia Orchestra and a largely British cast.[103] Since the late )Tj
T*(1990s numerous video recordings of the opera have been issued on DVD and )Tj
T*(Blu-ray disc \(BD\). These include recent productions and remastered versions of )Tj
T*(historic performances.[104] )Tj
T*( [edit] Editions and amendments )Tj
T*( The orchestral score of Tosca was published in late 1899 by Casa Ricordi. In )Tj
T*(contrast to his other operas, Puccini appeared to be satisfied with his initial )Tj
T*(score, which remained relatively unchanged in the 1909 edition prepared by )Tj
T*(Osbourne McConachy.[105] An unamended edition was published by Dover Press in )Tj
T*(1991.[106] )Tj
T*( The 1909 score contains a number of minor changes from the autograph score. )Tj
T*(Some are changes of phrase: Cavaradossi's reply to the sacristan when he asks )Tj
T*(if the painter is doing penance is changed from "Pranzai"[107] \("I have )Tj
T*(eaten."\) to "Fame non ho" \("I am not hungry."\), which William Ashbrook states, )Tj
T*(in his study of Puccini's operas, accentuates the class distinction between the )Tj
T*(two. When Tosca comforts Cavaradossi after the torture scene, she now tells )Tj
T*(him, "Ma il giusto Iddio lo punir√°" \("But a just God will punish him" )Tj
T*([Scarpia]\); formerly she stated, "Ma il sozzo sbirro lo pagher√†" \("But the )Tj
T*(filthy cop will pay for it."\). Other changes are in the music; when Tosca )Tj
T*(demands the price for Cavaradossi's freedom \("Il prezzo!"\), her music is )Tj
T*(changed to eliminate an octave leap, allowing her more opportunity to express )Tj
T*(her contempt and loathing of Scarpia in a passage which is now near the middle )Tj

T*(of the soprano vocal range.[108] A remnant of a "Latin Hymn" sung by Tosca and )Tj
T*(Cavaradossi in act 3 survived into the first published score and libretto, but )Tj
T*(is not in later versions.[109] According to Ashbrook, the most surprising )Tj
T*(change is where, after Tosca discovers the truth about the "mock" execution and )Tj
T*(exclaims "Finire cos√¨? Finire cos√¨?" \("To end like this? To end like this?"\), )Tj
T*(she was to sing a five-bar fragment to the melody of "E lucevan le stelle". )Tj
T*(Ashbrook applauds Puccini for deleting the section from a point in the work )Tj
T*(where delay is almost unendurable as events rush to their conclusion. He also )Tj
T*(points out that the orchestra's recalling "E lucevan le stelle" in the final )Tj
T*(notes would seem less incongruous if it was meant to underscore Tosca's and )Tj
T*(Cavaradossi's love for each other, rather than being simply a melody which )Tj
T*(Tosca never hears.[110] )Tj

T*(may not exceed 1¬†m \(3¬†ft\) in height. At an exposed area such as Green Cape, it )Tj
T*(is reduced further to a 30¬†cm \(12¬†in\) prostrate shrub.[5] This subspecies has a )Tj
T*(woody base, known as a lignotuber, which begins developing in the first year of )Tj
T*(life.[3]Banksia paludosa subspecies astrolux is a more open nonlignotuberous )Tj
T*(shrub which reaches 5¬†m \(16¬†ft\) high.[2] )Tj
T*( The bark and foliage is smooth, although the new growth is covered in fine )Tj
T*(hair. The stems are generally less than 2¬†cm \(0.8¬†in\) in diameter,[3] and may )Tj
T*(be red or yellow when young.[6] The leaves are alternate or whorled along the )Tj
T*(stems, and spear- to egg-shaped \(lanceolate to obovate\) in shape. They measure )Tj
T*(4‚Äì13¬†cm \(1.6‚Äì5.2¬†in\) long and 1‚Äì3¬†cm \(0.4‚Äì1.2¬†in\) wide. The leaf margins are )Tj
T*(entire or have occasional serrations. The leaf undersurface is white, with a )Tj
T*(midrib.[3] Flowering occurs over autumn and winter \(April to July\) and the )Tj
T*(flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arise from stems that are three or more )Tj
T*(years old. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike or )Tj
T*(axis from which a large number of compact floral units arise perpendicularly to )Tj

T*(high.[3] The individual flowers are more openly spaced than those of other )Tj
T*(banksias, and this is especially evident in late bud.[6] This, coupled with the )Tj
T*(tall thin shape of the flower spike, makes the species quite distinctive.[3] )Tj
T*(The flower spikes are pale- to golden brown in bud, and open to a more gold )Tj
T*(colour after anthesis.[6] Variations are seen, one form having a grey limb in )Tj
T*(bud, and plants with particularly tall flower spikes have been recorded near )Tj
T*(Huskisson at Jervis Bay.[7] As with most banksias, anthesis is acropetal; the )Tj
T*(opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to )Tj
T*(the top.[3] The process from bud to the finishing of flowering takes six to )Tj
T*(eight weeks.[8] )Tj
T*( As they age, the flower spikes fade to grey, with the old flowers remaining )Tj
T*(for years. Up to 60 woody follicles develop on each spike, known in this stage )Tj
T*(an as infructescence. Narrow and elliptic, they measure 0.9‚Äì1.8¬†cm \(0.4‚Äì0.7¬†in\) )Tj

T*( [edit] Placement within Banksia )Tj
T*( The current taxonomic arrangement of the Banksia genus is based on botanist )Tj
T*(Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series.[2] In this )Tj
T*(arrangement, B.¬†paludosa is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its )Tj
T*(inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section )Tj
T*(Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its )Tj
T*(inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published )Tj
T*(in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Integrifoliae, )Tj
T*(within the series Salicinae.[13] However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was )Tj

T*(Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata until they observed the flower spikes )Tj
T*(typical of B.¬†paludosa. The subspecies was initially termed the Nattai River )Tj
T*(form of B.¬†paludosa,[18] until it was formally named by George, who coined its )Tj

T*(nominate subspecies paludosa is found from Glen Davis through to the Sydney )Tj
T*(region and then south to Ulladulla on the South Coast, with a separate )Tj
T*(population in the vicinity of Eden just north of the Victorian border. It )Tj
T*(occurs inland as far as Taralga on the Southern Tablelands. It was collected in )Tj
T*(1966 from Hat Head on the Mid North Coast by Lawrie Johnson, but has not been )Tj
T*(found there since despite field work in the area.[5] This record aside, the )Tj
T*(northernmost historical coastal record is from what is now Centennial Park and )Tj
T*(La Perouse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where it is now locally vanished.[8] )Tj
T*(Subspecies astrolux is restricted to Nattai National Park in the Southern )Tj
T*(Highlands.[5] )Tj
T*( Both subspecies grow in nutrient-poor well-drained sandstone soils, in open )Tj
T*(woodland with trees such as Sydney peppermint \(Eucalyptus piperita\), silvertop )Tj
T*(ash \(E.¬†sieberi\), grey gum \(E.¬†punctata\), narrow-leaved stringybark \(E.¬†)Tj

T*(\(Hakea teretifolia\).[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ecology )Tj
T*( Banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa is a slow-growing shrub which regenerates )Tj
T*(from bushfire by resprouting from its lignotuber. After fire, plants take )Tj
T*(around three years to flower significantly, but are flowering well by five )Tj
T*(years afterwards. Flowerhead numbers dwindle by fourteen years post bushfire. )Tj
T*(Plants are estimated to live to around 60 years of age. Seedlings also appear )Tj
T*(from seed dispersed after bushfire.[8] All banksias have developed proteoid or )Tj
T*(cluster roots in response to the nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils )Tj
T*(\(particularly lacking in phosphorus\).[21] )Tj
T*( The flower spikes of Banksia paludosa are unable to self-pollinate and require )Tj
T*(pollinators to set seed.[4] A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of )Tj
T*(outcrossing; pollen from one plant is well-mixed among other plants in the )Tj
T*(locale. Nonflying mammals are important pollinators in heathland habitat, with )Tj
T*(the Brown Antechinus \(Antechinus stuartii\) a frequent visitor to flower spikes. )Tj
T*(The Sugar Glider \(Petaurus breviceps\) is another mammal pollinator.[4] Bird )Tj
T*(species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the )Tj
T*(Red Wattlebird \(Anthochaera carunculata\), Yellow-faced Honeyeater )Tj
T*(\(Lichenostomus chrysops\), White-eared Honeyeater \(L. leucotis\), Crescent )Tj
T*(Honeyeater \(Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera\), New Holland Honeyeater \(P.¬†)Tj
T*(novaehollandiae\), and Eastern Spinebill \(Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris\).[5] )Tj
T*(Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European Honey Bee and )Tj
T*(ants.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cultivation )Tj
T*( Banksia paludosa was first introduced into cultivation in England in 1805. The )Tj
T*(species was grown at Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens, Woburn Abbey, Loddiges )Tj
T*(nursery in Hackney, John Miller's nursery in Bristol and George Hibbert's )Tj
T*(garden at Clapham Common.[22] It was also grown in the Villa San Donato in )Tj
T*(Italy, in the collection of Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San )Tj
T*(Donato.[23] )Tj
T*( Banksia paludosa is cultivated in Australian gardens, and does best with a )Tj
T*(sunny aspect and good drainage, in soils with a pH from 5.5 to 7.5. Slow )Tj
T*(growing, it flowers in 6 to 10 years from seed.[6] It can be propagated by )Tj
T*(seed, which take around two weeks to germinate,[24] or cutting. Low growing )Tj
T*(coastal \(dwarf\) forms which grow to 60¬†cm \(2¬†ft\) are also commercially )Tj
T*(available, and should be propagated by cutting to preserve features.[6] Noting )Tj
T*(the flower spikes to be "rather dull", plant author John Wrigley has described )Tj
T*(the species as "not a spectacular garden plant",[24] although its foliage has )Tj
T*(been described as "attractive".[12] A form from Jervis Bay with large orange )Tj
T*(flower spikes was deemed by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast Alf Salkin )Tj
T*(to have horticultural potential.[25] )Tj

T*( Galerina marginata is a species of poisonous fungus in the family )Tj
T*(Hymenogastraceae of the order Agaricales. Prior to 2001, the species G.¬†)Tj
T*(autumnalis, G.¬†oregonensis, G.¬†unicolor, and G.¬†venenata were thought to be )Tj
T*(separate due to differences in habitat and the viscidity of their caps, but )Tj
T*(phylogenetic analysis showed that they are all the same species. )Tj
T*( The fruit bodies of this fungus have brown to yellow-brown caps that fade in )Tj
T*(color when drying. The gills are brownish and give a rusty spore print. A )Tj
T*(well-defined membranous ring is typically seen on the stems of young specimens )Tj
T*(but often disappears with age. In older fruit bodies, the caps are flatter and )Tj
T*(the gills and stems browner. The species is a classic "little brown mushroom"‚Äîa )Tj
T*(catchall category that includes all small to medium-sized, hard-to-identify )Tj
T*(brownish mushrooms, and may be easily confused with several edible species. )Tj
T*( Galerina marginata is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, )Tj
T*(North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a )Tj
T*(wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. An )Tj
T*(extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the )Tj

T*( [edit] Taxonomy and naming )Tj
T*( What is now recognized as a single morphologically variable taxon named )Tj
T*(Galerina marginata was once split into five distinct species. Norwegian )Tj
T*(mycologist Gro Gulden and colleagues concluded that all five represented the )Tj
T*(same species after comparing the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed )Tj
T*(spacer region of ribosomal DNA for various North American and European )Tj
T*(specimens in Galerina section Naucoriopsis. The results showed no genetic )Tj
T*(differences between G.¬†marginata and G.¬†autumnalis, G.¬†oregonensis, G.¬†)Tj
T*(unicolor, and G.¬†venenata, thus reducing all these names to synonymy.[1] The )Tj
T*(oldest of these names are Agaricus marginatus, described by August Batsch in )Tj
T*(1789,[2] and Agaricus unicolor, described by Martin Vahl in 1792.[3]Agaricus )Tj
T*(autumnalis was described by Charles Horton Peck in 1873, and later moved to )Tj
T*(Galerina by A.¬†H.¬†Smith and Rolf Singer in their 1962 worldwide monograph on )Tj
T*(that genus. In the same publication they also introduced the G.¬†autumnalis )Tj
T*(varieties robusta and angusticystis.[4] Another of the synonymous species, G.¬†)Tj
T*(oregonensis, was first described in that monograph. Galerina venenata was first )Tj
T*(identified as a species by Smith in 1953.[5] Since Agaricus marginatus is the )Tj

T*(Agaricales, G.¬†marginata is the type species of Galerina section Naucoriopsis, )Tj
T*(a subdivision first defined by French mycologist Robert K√ºhner in 1935.[8] It )Tj

T*(Marginata. Autumnalis species are characterized by having a viscid to lubricous )Tj
T*(cap surface while Marginata species lack a gelatinous cap‚Äîthe surface is moist, )Tj
T*("fatty-shining", or matte when wet.[10] However, as Gulden explains, this )Tj

T*(be described differently and applied inconsistently by different persons )Tj
T*(applying terms such as lubricous, fatty, fatty-shiny, sticky, viscid, )Tj
T*(glutinous, or \(somewhat\) slimy."[1] )Tj
T*( The specific epithet marginata is derived from the Latin word for "margin" or )Tj
T*("edge",[11] while autumnalis means "of the autumn".[12]Common names of the )Tj

T*(Galerina". G.¬†autumnalis was known as the "fall Galerina" or the "autumnal )Tj
T*(Galerina", while G.¬†venenata was the "deadly lawn Galerina".[15][16] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The cap reaches 1.7 to 4 cm \(0.67 to 1.6 in\) in diameter. It starts convex, )Tj
T*(sometimes broadly conical, and has edges \(margins\) that are curved in against )Tj
T*(the gills. As the cap grows and expands, it becomes broadly convex and then )Tj
T*(flattened, sometimes developing a central elevation, or umbo, which may project )Tj
T*(prominently from the cap surface.[13] )Tj
T*( Based on the collective descriptions of the five taxa now considered to be G.¬†)Tj
T*(marginata, the texture of the surface shows significant variation. Smith and )Tj
T*(Singer give the following descriptions of surface texture: from "viscid" \(G.¬†)Tj
T*(autumnalis\),[4] to "shining and viscid to lubricous when moist" \(G.¬†)Tj
T*(oregonensis\),[17] to "shining, lubricous to subviscid \(particles of dirt adhere )Tj
T*(to surface\) or merely moist, with a fatty appearance although not distinctly )Tj
T*(viscid",[18] to "moist but not viscid" \(G.¬†marginata\).[19] The cap surface )Tj
T*(remains smooth and changes colors with humidity \(hygrophanous\), pale to dark )Tj
T*(ochraceous tawny over the disc and yellow-ochraceous on the margin \(at least )Tj
T*(when young\), but fading to dull tan or darker when dry. When moist, the cap is )Tj
T*(somewhat transparent so that the outlines of the gills may be seen as )Tj
T*(striations. The flesh is pale brownish ochraceous to nearly white, thin and )Tj
T*(pliant, with an odor and taste varying from very slightly to strongly like )Tj
T*(flour \(farinaceous\).[19] )Tj
T*( The gills are typically narrow and crowded together, with a broadly adnate to )Tj
T*(nearly decurrent attachment to the stem and convex edges. They are a pallid )Tj
T*(brown when young, becoming tawny at maturity. Some short gills, called )Tj
T*(lamellulae, do not extend entirely from the cap edge to the stem, and are )Tj
T*(intercalated among the longer gills. The stem ranges from 3 to 6 cm \(1.2 to 2.4 )Tj
T*(in\) long, 3 to 9 mm \(0.12 to 0.35 in\) thick at the apex, and stays equal in )Tj
T*(width throughout or is slightly enlarged downward. Initially solid, it becomes )Tj
T*(hollow from the bottom up as it matures. The membranous ring is located on the )Tj
T*(upper half of the stem near the cap, but may be sloughed off and missing in )Tj
T*(older specimens. Its color is initially whitish or light brown, but usually )Tj
T*(appears a darker rusty-brown in mature specimens that have dropped spores on )Tj
T*(it. Above the level of the ring, the stem surface has a very fine whitish )Tj
T*(powder and is paler than the cap; below the ring it is brown down to the )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( General chemical structure of amatoxins )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The toxins found in Galerina marginata are known as amatoxins. Amatoxins )Tj
T*(belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide derivatives composed of an amino )Tj
T*(acid ring bridged by a sulphur atom and characterized by differences in their )Tj
T*(side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal )Tj
T*(mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase )Tj
T*(II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The )Tj
T*(toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of )Tj
T*(metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. )Tj
T*(Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to filter )Tj
T*(out poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to )Tj
T*(recirculate and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include )Tj
T*(severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine )Tj
T*(hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in )Tj
T*(gastrointestinal bleeding, a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually )Tj
T*(within seven days of consumption.[35] )Tj
T*( Galerina marginata was shown in various studies to contain the amatoxins )Tj
T*(Œ±-amanitin and Œ≥-amanitin, first as G.¬†venenata,[36] then as G.¬†marginata and )Tj
T*(G.¬†autumnalis.[37] The ability of the fungus to produce these toxins was )Tj
T*(confirmed by growing the mycelium as a liquid culture \(only trace amounts of )Tj
T*(√ü-amanitin were found\).[38]G.¬†marginata is thought to be the only species of )Tj
T*(the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in )Tj
T*(culture.[39] Both amanitins were quantified in G.¬†autumnalis \(1.5¬†mg/g dry )Tj
T*(weight\)[40] and G.¬†marginata \(1.1¬†mg/g dry weight\).[41] Later experiments )Tj
T*(confirmed the occurrence of Œ≥-amanitin and √ü-amanitin in German specimens of G.¬†)Tj
T*(autumnalis and G.¬†marginata and revealed the presence of the three amanitins in )Tj
T*(the fruit bodies of G.¬†unicolor.[42] Although some mushroom field guides claim )Tj
T*(that the species \(as G.¬†autumnalis\) also contains phallotoxins,[15][43] )Tj
T*(scientific evidence does not support this contention.[23] A 2004 study )Tj
T*(determined that the amatoxin content of G.¬†marginata varied from 78.17 to )Tj
T*(243.61¬†¬µg/g of fresh weight. In this study, the amanitin amounts from certain )Tj
T*(Galerina specimens were higher than those from some Amanita phalloides, a )Tj
T*(European fungus generally considered as the richest in amanitins. The authors )Tj
T*(suggest that "other parameters such as extrinsic factors \(environmental )Tj
T*(conditions\) and intrinsic factors \(genetic properties\) could contribute to the )Tj
T*(significant variance in amatoxin contents from different specimens."[23] The )Tj
T*(lethal dose of amatoxins has been estimated to be about 0.1¬†mg/kg human body )Tj
T*(weight, or even lower.[44] Based on this value, the ingestion of 10 G.¬†)Tj
T*(marginata fruit bodies containing about 250¬†¬µg of amanitins per gram of fresh )Tj
T*(tissue could poison a child weighing approximately 20 kilograms \(44¬†lb\). )Tj
T*(However, a 20-year retrospective study of more than 2100 cases of amatoxin )Tj
T*(poisonings from North American and Europe showed that few cases were due to )Tj
T*(ingestion of Galerina species. This low frequency may be attributed to the )Tj
T*(mushroom's nondescript appearance as a "little brown mushroom" leading to it )Tj
T*(being overlooked by collectors, and by the fact that 21% of amatoxin poisonings )Tj
T*(were caused by unidentified species.[23] )Tj

T*(adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work. Lichtenstein was )Tj
T*(among them, and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters. Andy )Tj
T*(Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, )Tj
T*(unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961.[1] )Tj
T*(Lichtenstein's 1961 works, especially Look Mickey, are considered a minor step )Tj
T*(from his earlier comic strip pop art.[2] )Tj
T*( According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, Look Mickey was based on the Little )Tj
T*(Golden Book series.[3] The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is )Tj
T*(entitled Donald Duck Lost and Found, written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and )Tj
T*(published through Disney Enterprises. The image was illustrated by Bob Grant )Tj
T*(and Bob Totten.[4][5] An alternate theory suggests that Look Mickey and Popeye )Tj
T*(were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers.[1] This image marked the first of )Tj
T*(numerous of works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer )Tj
T*(closer to the scene.[6] )Tj
T*( A number of stories purport to tell of the moment of inspiration for Look )Tj
T*(Mickey. Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled one of )Tj
T*(his sons pointing to a comic book and challenging; "I bet you can't paint as )Tj
T*(good as that".[7] Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to )Tj
T*(prove his abilities to both his son and his son's classmates who mocked )Tj
T*(Lichtenstein's hard to fathom abstracts.[8] American painter Allan Kaprow once )Tj
T*(stated, in reference to a Bazooka Double Bubble Gum wrapper, to Lichtenstein, )Tj
T*("You can't teach color from C√©zanne, you can only teach it from something like )Tj
T*(this." Lichtenstein then showed him one of his Donald Duck images.[9] )Tj
T*( During the comic book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often slightly altered )Tj
T*(the colorization of the original source.[10] According to Marco Livingstone, )Tj
T*(his early comic subjects comprise a "loose and improvised style clearly derived )Tj
T*(from de Kooning."[1] Art historian Jonathan Fineberg, describes Lichtenstein's )Tj
T*(1960 as an "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related )Tj
T*(stylistically to the de Kooning Women".[11] When Leo Castelli saw both )Tj
T*(Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show )Tj
T*(only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the Campbell's Soup Cans series )Tj
T*(to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then )Tj
T*(producing.[12][13] He once said "I've got to do something that really will have )Tj
T*(a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James )Tj
T*(Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly )Tj
T*(what they're doing."[14] Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the )Tj
T*(abandonment of the topic by Warhol.[15] Although Lichtenstein continued to work )Tj
T*(with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like )Tj
T*(Popeye and Mickey Mouse.[16] )Tj
T*( During autumn 1961, Allan Kaprow, a fellow teacher at Rutgers University, )Tj
T*(introduced Lichenstein to art dealer Ivan Karp, the director of the Leo )Tj
T*(Castelli Gallery. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings, but not Look )Tj
T*(Mickey. He instead impressed him with Girl with Ball, and Karp decided to )Tj
T*(represent Lichtenstein a few weeks later.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description )Tj
T*( The painting is one of Lichtenstein's first non-expressionist works, and marks )Tj
T*(his initial employment of Ben-Day dots which he used to give it an "industrial" )Tj
T*(half-tone effect. The painting is his first use both of a speech balloon[3] and )Tj
T*(comics as source material.[17] The work has visible pencil marks and was )Tj

T*( ‚ÄîLichtenstein on the germination of his style[18] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( In reproducing a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein )Tj
T*(simplifies by reducing the composition to primary colors, which serves to )Tj
T*(accentuates its mass appeal and largely gives it the "pop" look.[4] Typically, )Tj
T*(Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce a variety of colors by using dots of a )Tj
T*(few colors to give the illusion of a broader pallet. By mixing dots of )Tj
T*(different colors, like an ink jet printer, just a few colors can create a broad )Tj
T*(spectrum using only a limited number of primiary hues. Lichtenstein as a )Tj
T*(painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoids this, achieving his )Tj
T*(individual color tones without blending existing hues. Instead, for each color )Tj
T*(that he wanted to include in a work, he used that color paint.[19] )Tj
T*( Lichtenstein made several alterations to the original work: he eliminated )Tj
T*(various non-essential figures and rotated the dock so that Donald looks off the )Tj
T*(side rather than the end. At the same time, he kept Donald and Mickey in almost )Tj
T*(the same positions as they were in the original.[20] Lichtenstein not only )Tj
T*(redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and )Tj
T*(fishing rod for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to )Tj
T*(form a meticulous composition.[21]Walt Disney said about Donald Duck: "He's got )Tj
T*(a big mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside )Tj
T*(that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal )Tj
T*(subject."[22] Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical )Tj
T*(features.[23] )Tj
T*( Compared to the original source, Donald leans further forward towards the )Tj
T*(water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from )Tj
T*(exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald.[24] )Tj
T*(The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, )Tj
T*(including misaligning the joining of the contours of the waves with the yellow )Tj
T*(sky to give rise to an area of white space.[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Interpretation )Tj
T*( The large scale reproduction of a comic strip frame was considered radical and )Tj
T*(revolutionary at the time.[25] Critics applauded the work's playfulness, )Tj
T*(inherent humour and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the Solomon R. )Tj
T*(Guggenheim Museum, "Look Mickey is broad comedy and falls into the category of )Tj
T*(slapstick¬†..."[26] Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its of "linear clarity )Tj
T*(and colour", the critic writes, adds to its aesthetic value and grandeur, )Tj
T*(reinforced by his choice of scale.[27] A common misconception about )Tj
T*(Lichtenstein comes from the fact that in his best known works, his meticulous )Tj
T*(approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his )Tj
T*(paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture )Tj
T*(icons.[21] Graham Bader wrote that "Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears )Tj
T*(more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it )Tj
T*(is based."[28]Look Mickey is considered self-referential in the sense that the )Tj
T*(artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the )Tj
T*(artist.[29] )Tj
T*( Bader observes that Look Mickey is concerned both with the artistic process )Tj
T*(and Lichtenstein's new painting techniques. He believes it can be considered a )Tj
T*(self-portrait in the sense that it "explicitly situates the painting's maker )Tj
T*(himself within the self-enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center". The )Tj
T*(painting shows Donald looking into the reflective water at Lichtenstein's blue )Tj
T*('rfl' signature "as a kind of surrogate for the image's creator", in a manner )Tj
T*(that is reminiscent Caravaggio's Narcissus, in which the subject gazes at his )Tj
T*(own reflection on the water.[29] This is viewed as an allegory of )Tj
T*(Lichtenstein's position as an artist trained to develop his realist instincts )Tj
T*(despite the prominence of abstract expressionism. When viewed this way, Mickey )Tj
T*(serves as the "vanguard modernist" superego towering over Lichtenstein and )Tj
T*(laughing at his retrograde efforts.[24] )Tj
T*( Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots to color Mickey's face. According to some )Tj
T*(art critics, this gives the character the appearance blushing, a )Tj

T*(socio-psychosomatic reflex that is typically experienced when we are conscious )Tj
T*(of how we appear to others. Other interpretations are that the coloration is )Tj
T*(merely skin pigmentation or that it is the hue associated with a "healthy )Tj
T*(glow", since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather )Tj
T*(than fur.[30] Another interpretation ‚Äì supported by the original source in )Tj
T*(which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch ‚Äì )Tj
T*(is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his )Tj
T*(disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority.[24] Those )Tj
T*(adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness )Tj
T*(of the red dots, but others are quick to point out that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day )Tj
T*(dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a )Tj
T*(stencil \(i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface )Tj
T*(through a screen of dots\) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.[31] )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Graham Bader, describing it as the engine of the painting's narrative, notes )Tj
T*(the intrigue created by the juxtaposition of Donald's heightened sense of )Tj
T*(visual perception as it relates to his anticipated catch, and his deadened )Tj
T*(sense of tactile perception as it relates to having a fishing hook in the back )Tj
T*(of his own shirt. In this sense, Lichtenstein has chosen to depict a source )Tj
T*(that has as its subject a divide between raised visual awareness and an absent )Tj
T*(sense of touch:[32] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Donald is an explicitly divided subject, all sensory experience on one end and, )Tj
T*(literally, numbness on the other \(and, visually, all depth and all flatness ‚Äì )Tj
T*(for Donald's face is by far the painting's most spatially illusionistic )Tj
T*(element, while his caught jacket, merged with the schematic waves behind it, )Tj
T*(emphatically one of its flattest\). Indeed, Donald is a portrait of precisely )Tj
T*(the separation of sight and feeling, vision and touch‚Ä¶ What divides vision and )Tj
T*(touch in Look Mickey, what marks this shift between them, is text: the words )Tj
T*(that Donald \(and Lichtenstein\) introduces to the scene, and which the duck's )Tj
T*(pole-cum-brush passes through before snagging his own back end.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Lichtenstein frequently explored vision-related themes after he began to work )Tj
T*(in the pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and )Tj
T*(There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey.[33] In this painting, Donald's large )Tj

T*(The idea of doing [a cartoon painting] without apparent alteration just )Tj
T*(occurred to me¬†... and I did one really almost half seriously to get an idea of )Tj
T*(what it might look like. And as I was painting this painting I kind of got )Tj
T*(interested in organizing it as a painting and brought it to some kind of )Tj
T*(conclusion as an aesthetic statement, which I hadn't really intended to do to )Tj
T*(begin with. And then I really went back to my other kind of painting, which was )Tj
T*(pretty abstract. Or tried to. But I had this cartoon painting in my studio, and )Tj
T*(it was a little too formidable. I coudn't keep my eyes off it, and it sort of )Tj
T*(prevented me from painting in any other way, and then I decided this stuff was )Tj

T*(Knights Templar, the Order of the Temple \(French: Ordre du Temple or Templiers\) )Tj
T*(or simply as Templars, were among the most famous of the Western Christian )Tj
T*(military orders.[4] The organisation existed for nearly two centuries during )Tj
T*(the Middle Ages. )Tj
T*( Officially endorsed by the Catholic Church around 1129, the Order became a )Tj
T*(favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and )Tj
T*(power. Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, )Tj
T*(were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades.[5] Non-combatant )Tj
T*(members of the Order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout )Tj
T*(Christendom, innovating financial techniques that were an early form of )Tj
T*(banking,[6][7] and building fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land. )Tj
T*( The Templars' existence was tied closely to the Crusades; when the Holy Land )Tj
T*(was lost, support for the Order faded. Rumours about the Templars' secret )Tj
T*(initiation ceremony created mistrust and King Philip IV of France, deeply in )Tj
T*(debt to the Order, took advantage of the situation. In 1307, many of the )Tj
T*(Order's members in France were arrested, tortured into giving false )Tj
T*(confessions, and then burned at the stake.[8] Under pressure from King Philip, )Tj
T*(Pope Clement V disbanded the Order in 1312. The abrupt disappearance of a major )Tj
T*(part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends, which )Tj
T*(have kept the "Templar" name alive into the modern day. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( After the First Crusade recaptured Jerusalem in 1099, many Christian pilgrims )Tj
T*(travelled to visit what they referred to as the Holy Places. However, though )Tj
T*(the city of Jerusalem was under relatively secure control, the rest of Outremer )Tj
T*(was not. Bandits abounded, and pilgrims were routinely slaughtered, sometimes )Tj
T*(by the hundreds, as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline at )Tj
T*(Jaffa into the Holy Land.[9] )Tj
T*( Around 1119, the French knight Hugues de Payens approached King Baldwin II of )Tj
T*(Jerusalem with the proposal of creating a monastic order for the protection of )Tj
T*(these pilgrims. King Baldwin agreed to the request, and granted space for a )Tj
T*(headquarters in a wing of the royal palace on the Temple Mount, in the captured )Tj
T*(Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what was )Tj
T*(believed to be the ruins of the Temple of Solomon.[5][10] The Crusaders )Tj
T*(therefore referred to the Al Aqsa Mosque as Solomon's Temple, and it was from )Tj
T*(this location that the new Order took the name of Poor Knights of Christ and )Tj
T*(the Temple of Solomon, or "Templar" knights. The Order, with about nine knights )Tj
T*(including Godfrey de Saint-Omer and Andr√© de Montbard, had few financial )Tj
T*(resources and relied on donations to survive. Their emblem was of two knights )Tj
T*(riding on a single horse, emphasising the Order's poverty.[11] )Tj

T*(Knighthood[12] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The Templars' impoverished status did not last long. They had a powerful )Tj
T*(advocate in Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a leading Church figure and a nephew of )Tj
T*(Andr√© de Montbard, one of the founding knights. Bernard spoke and wrote )Tj
T*(persuasively on their behalf and, in 1129, at the Council of Troyes the Order )Tj
T*(was officially endorsed by the Church. With this formal blessing, the Templars )Tj
T*(became a favoured charity throughout Christendom, receiving money, land, )Tj
T*(businesses, and noble-born sons from families who were eager to help with the )Tj
T*(fight in the Holy Land. Another major benefit came in 1139, when Pope Innocent )Tj
T*(II's papal bull Omne Datum Optimum exempted the Order from obedience to local )Tj
T*(laws. This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all )Tj
T*(borders, were not required to pay any taxes, and were exempt from all authority )Tj
T*(except that of the pope.[13] )Tj
T*( With its clear mission and ample resources, the Order grew rapidly. Templars )Tj
T*(were often the advance force in key battles of the Crusades, as the heavily )Tj
T*(armoured knights on their warhorses would set out to charge at the enemy, in an )Tj
T*(attempt to break opposition lines. One of their most famous victories was in )Tj
T*(1177 during the Battle of Montgisard, where some 500 Templar knights helped )Tj
T*(several thousand infantry to defeat Saladin's army of more than 26,000 )Tj
T*(soldiers.[14] )Tj
T*( Although the primary mission of the Order was military, relatively few members )Tj
T*(were combatants. The others acted in support positions to assist the knights )Tj
T*(and to manage the financial infrastructure. The Templar Order, though its )Tj
T*(members were sworn to individual poverty, was given control of wealth beyond )Tj
T*(direct donations. A nobleman who was interested in participating in the )Tj
T*(Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he was away. )Tj
T*(Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer, the )Tj
T*(Order in 1150 began generating letters of credit for pilgrims journeying to the )Tj
T*(Holy Land: pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory )Tj
T*(before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, )Tj
T*(then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds. )Tj
T*(This innovative arrangement was an early form of banking, and may have been the )Tj
T*(first formal system to support the use of cheques; it improved the safety of )Tj
T*(pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for thieves, and also )Tj
T*(contributed to the Templar coffers.[5][15] )Tj
T*( Based on this mix of donations and business dealing, the Templars established )Tj
T*(financial networks across the whole of Christendom. They acquired large tracts )Tj
T*(of land, both in Europe and the Middle East; they bought and managed farms and )Tj
T*(vineyards; they built churches and castles; they were involved in )Tj
T*(manufacturing, import and export; they had their own fleet of ships; and at one )Tj
T*(point they even owned the entire island of Cyprus. The Order of the Knights )Tj
T*(Templar arguably qualifies as the world's first multinational )Tj
T*(corporation.[14][16][17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Decline )Tj
T*( In the mid-12th century, the tide began to turn in the Crusades. The Muslim )Tj
T*(world had become more united under effective leaders such as Saladin, and )Tj
T*(dissension arose among Christian factions in and concerning the Holy Land. The )Tj
T*(Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian military )Tj
T*(orders, the Knights Hospitaller and the Teutonic Knights, and decades of )Tj
T*(internecine feuds weakened Christian positions, politically and militarily. )Tj
T*(After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns, including )Tj
T*(the pivotal Battle of the Horns of Hattin, Jerusalem was captured by Saladin's )Tj
T*(forces in 1187. The Crusaders retook the city in 1229, without Templar aid, but )Tj
T*(held it only briefly. In 1244, the Khwarezmi Turks recaptured Jerusalem, and )Tj
T*(the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when the British captured )Tj
T*(it from the Ottoman Turks.[18] )Tj
T*( The Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the )Tj
T*(north, such as the seaport of Acre, which they held for the next century. But )Tj
T*(they lost that, too, in 1291, followed by their last mainland strongholds, )Tj

T*(Tortosa \(Tartus in what is now Syria\), and Atlit in present-day Israel. Their )Tj
T*(headquarters then moved to Limassol on the island of Cyprus,[19] and they also )Tj
T*(attempted to maintain a garrison on tiny Arwad Island, just off the coast from )Tj
T*(Tortosa. In 1300, there was some attempt to engage in coordinated military )Tj
T*(efforts with the Mongols[20] via a new invasion force at Arwad. In 1302 or )Tj
T*(1303, however, the Templars lost the island to the Egyptian Mamluks in the )Tj
T*(Siege of Arwad. With the island gone, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in )Tj
T*(the Holy Land.[14][21] )Tj
T*( With the Order's military mission now less important, support for the )Tj
T*(organisation began to dwindle. The situation was complex though, as over the )Tj
T*(two hundred years of their existence, the Templars had become a part of daily )Tj
T*(life throughout Christendom.[22] The organisation's Templar Houses, hundreds of )Tj
T*(which were dotted throughout Europe and the Near East, gave them a widespread )Tj
T*(presence at the local level.[3] The Templars still managed many businesses, and )Tj
T*(many Europeans had daily contact with the Templar network, such as by working )Tj
T*(at a Templar farm or vineyard, or using the Order as a bank in which to store )Tj
T*(personal valuables. The Order was still not subject to local government, making )Tj
T*(it everywhere a "state within a state"‚Äîits standing army, though it no longer )Tj
T*(had a well-defined mission, could pass freely through all borders. This )Tj
T*(situation heightened tensions with some European nobility, especially as the )Tj
T*(Templars were indicating an interest in founding their own monastic state, just )Tj
T*(as the Teutonic Knights had done in Prussia[15] and the Knights Hospitaller )Tj
T*(were doing with Rhodes.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Arrests, charges and dissolution )Tj
T*( In 1305, the new Pope Clement V, based in France, sent letters to both the )Tj
T*(Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay and the Hospitaller Grand Master Fulk de )Tj
T*(Villaret to discuss the possibility of merging the two Orders. Neither was )Tj
T*(amenable to the idea, but Pope Clement persisted, and in 1306 he invited both )Tj
T*(Grand Masters to France to discuss the matter. De Molay arrived first in early )Tj
T*(1307, but de Villaret was delayed for several months. While waiting, De Molay )Tj
T*(and Clement discussed charges that had been made two years prior by an ousted )Tj
T*(Templar. It was generally agreed that the charges were false, but Clement sent )Tj
T*(King Philip IV of France a written request for assistance in the investigation. )Tj
T*(King Philip was already deeply in debt to the Templars from his war with the )Tj
T*(English and decided to seize upon the rumors for his own purposes. He began )Tj
T*(pressuring the Church to take action against the Order, as a way of freeing )Tj
T*(himself from his debts.[24] )Tj
T*( On Friday, 13 October 1307 \(a date sometimes spuriously linked with the origin )Tj
T*(of the Friday the 13th superstition and October surprise\)[25][26] Philip )Tj
T*(ordered de Molay and scores of other French Templars to be simultaneously )Tj
T*(arrested. The arrest warrant started with the phrase¬†: "Dieu n'est pas content, )Tj
T*(nous avons des ennemis de la foi dans le Royaume" ["God is not pleased. We have )Tj
T*(enemies of the faith in the kingdom"].[27] The Templars were charged with )Tj
T*(numerous offences \(including apostasy, idolatry, heresy, obscene rituals and )Tj
T*(homosexuality, financial corruption and fraud, and secrecy\).[28] Many of the )Tj
T*(accused confessed to these charges under torture, and these confessions, even )Tj
T*(though obtained under duress, caused a scandal in Paris. All interrogations )Tj
T*(were recorded on a thirty metre long parchment, kept at the "Archives )Tj
T*(nationales" in Paris. The prisoners were coerced to confess that they had spat )Tj
T*(on the Cross¬†: "Moi Raymond de La F√®re, 21 ans, reconnais que \(J'ai\) crach√© )Tj
T*(trois fois sur la Croix, mais de bouche et pas de coeur" \(free translation¬†: )Tj
T*("I, Raymond de La F√®re, 21 years old, admit that I have spat three times on the )Tj
T*(Cross, but only from my mouth and not from my heart"\). The Templars were )Tj
T*(accused of idolatry.[29] )Tj
T*( After more bullying from Philip, Pope Clement then issued the papal bull )Tj
T*(Pastoralis Praeeminentiae on 22 November 1307, which instructed all Christian )Tj
T*(monarchs in Europe to arrest all Templars and seize their assets.[30] )Tj
T*( Pope Clement called for papal hearings to determine the Templars' guilt or )Tj
T*(innocence, and once freed of the Inquisitors' torture, many Templars recanted )Tj
T*(their confessions. Some had sufficient legal experience to defend themselves in )Tj

T*(forced confessions to have dozens of Templars burned at the stake in )Tj
T*(Paris.[31][32] )Tj
T*( With Philip threatening military action unless the pope complied with his )Tj
T*(wishes, Pope Clement finally agreed to disband the Order, citing the public )Tj
T*(scandal that had been generated by the confessions. At the Council of Vienne in )Tj
T*(1312, he issued a series of papal bulls, including Vox in excelso, which )Tj
T*(officially dissolved the Order, and Ad providam, which turned over most Templar )Tj
T*(assets to the Hospitallers.[34] )Tj
T*( As for the leaders of the Order, the elderly Grand Master Jacques de Molay, )Tj
T*(who had confessed under torture, retracted his confession. Geoffroi de Charney, )Tj
T*(Preceptor of Normandy, also retracted his confession and insisted on his )Tj
T*(innocence. Both men were declared guilty of being relapsed heretics, and they )Tj
T*(were sentenced to burn alive at the stake in Paris on 18 March 1314. De Molay )Tj
T*(reportedly remained defiant to the end, asking to be tied in such a way that he )Tj

T*(arriver malheur √† ceux qui nous ont condamn√©s √† mort" \(free translation¬†: "God )Tj
T*(knows who is wrong and has sinned. Soon a calamity will occur to those who have )Tj
T*(condemned us to death"\).[27] Pope Clement died only a month later, and King )Tj
T*(Philip died in a hunting accident before the end of the year.[36][37][38] )Tj
T*( With the last of the Order's leaders gone, the remaining Templars around )Tj
T*(Europe were either arrested and tried under the Papal investigation \(with )Tj
T*(virtually none convicted\), absorbed into other military orders such as the )Tj
T*(Knights Hospitaller, or pensioned and allowed to live out their days )Tj
T*(peacefully. By papal decree, the property of the Templars was transferred to )Tj
T*(the Order of Hospitallers, which also absorbed many of the Templars' members. )Tj
T*(In effect, the dissolution of the Templars could be seen as the merger of the )Tj
T*(two rival orders.[39] Some may have fled to other territories outside Papal )Tj
T*(control, such as excommunicated Scotland or to Switzerland. Templar )Tj

T*( [edit] Chinon Parchment )Tj
T*( In September 2001, a document known as the "Chinon Parchment" dated 17‚Äì20 )Tj
T*(August 1308 was discovered in the Vatican Secret Archives by Barbara Frale, )Tj
T*(apparently after having been filed in the wrong place in 1628. It is a record )Tj
T*(of the trial of the Templars and shows that Clement absolved the Templars of )Tj
T*(all heresies in 1308 before formally disbanding the Order in 1312,[41] as did )Tj
T*(another Chinon Parchment dated 20 August 1308 addressed to Philip IV of France, )Tj
T*(also mentioning that all Templars that had confessed to heresy were "restored )Tj
T*(to the Sacraments and to the unity of the Church". This other Chinon Parchment )Tj
T*(has been well known to historians [42][43][44] having been published by √âtienne )Tj
T*(Baluze in 1693,[45] and by Pierre Dupuy in 1751.[46] )Tj
T*( The current position of the Roman Catholic Church is that the medieval )Tj
T*(persecution of the Knights Templar was unjust, that nothing was inherently )Tj
T*(wrong with the Order or its Rule, and that Pope Clement was pressed into his )Tj
T*(actions by the magnitude of the public scandal and by the dominating influence )Tj
T*(of King Philip IV, who was Clement's relative.[47][48] )Tj
T*( [edit] Organisation )Tj
T*( The Templars were organised as a monastic order similar to Bernard's )Tj
T*(Cistercian Order, which was considered the first effective international )Tj
T*(organization in Europe.[49] The organizational structure had a strong chain of )Tj
T*(authority. Each country with a major Templar presence \(France, England, Aragon, )Tj
T*(Portugal, Poitou, Apulia, Jerusalem, Tripoli, Antioch, Anjou, Hungary, and )Tj
T*(Croatia\)[50] had a Master of the Order for the Templars in that region. )Tj
T*( All of them were subject to the Grand Master, appointed for life, who oversaw )Tj
T*(both the Order's military efforts in the East and their financial holdings in )Tj
T*(the West. The Grand Master exercised his authority via the visitors-general of )Tj

T*(the order, who were knights specially appointed by the Grand Master and convent )Tj
T*(of Jerusalem to visit the different provinces, correct malpractices, introduce )Tj
T*(new regulations, and resolve important disputes. The visitors-general had the )Tj
T*(power to remove knights from office and to suspend the Master of the province )Tj
T*(concerned. )Tj
T*( No precise numbers exist, but it is estimated that at the Order's peak there )Tj
T*(were between 15,000 and 20,000 Templars, of whom about a tenth were actual )Tj
T*(knights.[2][3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ranks within the order )Tj
T*( [edit] Three main ranks )Tj
T*( There was a threefold division of the ranks of the Templars: the aristocratic )Tj
T*(knights, the lower-born sergeants, and the clergy. Knights were required to be )Tj
T*(of knightly descent and to wear white mantles. They were equipped as heavy )Tj
T*(cavalry, with three or four horses and one or two squires. Squires were )Tj
T*(generally not members of the Order but were instead outsiders who were hired )Tj
T*(for a set period of time. Beneath the knights in the Order and drawn from lower )Tj
T*(social strata were the sergeants.[51] They were either equipped as light )Tj
T*(cavalry with a single horse[52] or served in other ways such as administering )Tj
T*(the property of the Order or performing menial tasks and trades. Chaplains, )Tj
T*(constituting a third Templar class, were ordained priests who saw to the )Tj
T*(Templar's' spiritual needs.[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] Grand Masters )Tj
T*( Starting with founder Hugues de Payens in 1118‚Äì1119, the Order's highest )Tj
T*(office was that of Grand Master, a position which was held for life, though )Tj
T*(considering the martial nature of the Order, this could mean a very short )Tj
T*(tenure. All but two of the Grand Masters died in office, and several died )Tj
T*(during military campaigns. For example, during the Siege of Ascalon in 1153, )Tj
T*(Grand Master Bernard de Tremelay led a group of 40 Templars through a breach in )Tj
T*(the city walls. When the rest of the Crusader army did not follow, the )Tj
T*(Templars, including their Grand Master, were surrounded and beheaded.[54] Grand )Tj
T*(Master G√©rard de Ridefort was beheaded by Saladin in 1189 at the Siege of Acre. )Tj
T*( The Grand Master oversaw all of the operations of the Order, including both )Tj
T*(the military operations in the Holy Land and Eastern Europe and the Templars' )Tj
T*(financial and business dealings in Western Europe. Some Grand Masters also )Tj
T*(served as battlefield commanders, though this was not always wise: several )Tj
T*(blunders in de Ridefort's combat leadership contributed to the devastating )Tj
T*(defeat at the Battle of Hattin. The last Grand Master was Jacques de Molay, )Tj
T*(burned at the stake in Paris in 1314 by order of King Philip IV.[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Behaviour and dress )Tj
T*( It was Bernard de Clairvaux and founder Hugues de Payens who devised the )Tj
T*(specific code of behaviour for the Templar Order, known to modern historians as )Tj
T*(the Latin Rule. Its 72 clauses defined the ideal behaviour for the Knights, )Tj
T*(such as the types of garments they were to wear and how many horses they could )Tj
T*(have. Knights were to take their meals in silence, eat meat no more than three )Tj
T*(times per week, and not have physical contact of any kind with women, even )Tj
T*(members of their own family. A Master of the Order was assigned "4 horses, and )Tj
T*(one chaplain-brother and one clerk with three horses, and one sergeant brother )Tj
T*(with two horses, and one gentleman valet to carry his shield and lance, with )Tj
T*(one horse."[55] As the Order grew, more guidelines were added, and the original )Tj
T*(list of 72 clauses was expanded to several hundred in its final form.[56][57] )Tj
T*( The knights wore a white surcoat with a red cross and a white mantle; the )Tj
T*(sergeants wore a black tunic with a red cross on front and back and a black or )Tj
T*(brown mantle.[58][59] The white mantle was assigned to the Templars at the )Tj
T*(Council of Troyes in 1129, and the cross was most probably added to their robes )Tj
T*(at the launch of the Second Crusade in 1147, when Pope Eugenius III, King Louis )Tj
T*(VII of France, and many other notables attended a meeting of the French )Tj
T*(Templars at their headquarters near Paris.[60][61][62] According to their Rule, )Tj
T*(the knights were to wear the white mantle at all times, even being forbidden to )Tj
T*(eat or drink unless they were wearing it.[63] )Tj
T*( The red cross that the Templars wore on their robes was a symbol of martyrdom, )Tj

T*(and to die in combat was considered a great honor that assured a place in )Tj
T*(heaven.[64] There was a cardinal rule that the warriors of the Order should )Tj
T*(never surrender unless the Templar flag had fallen, and even then they were )Tj
T*(first to try to regroup with another of the Christian orders, such as that of )Tj
T*(the Hospitallers. Only after all flags had fallen were they allowed to leave )Tj
T*(the battlefield.[65] This uncompromising principle, along with their reputation )Tj
T*(for courage, excellent training, and heavy armament, made the Templars one of )Tj
T*(the most feared combat forces in medieval times.[66] )Tj
T*( Initiation,[67] known as Reception \(receptio\) into the Order, was a profound )Tj
T*(commitment and involved a solemn ceremony. Outsiders were discouraged from )Tj
T*(attending the ceremony, which aroused the suspicions of medieval inquisitors )Tj
T*(during the later trials. )Tj
T*( New members had to willingly sign over all of their wealth and goods to the )Tj
T*(Order and take vows of poverty, chastity, piety, and obedience.[68] Most )Tj
T*(brothers joined for life, although some were allowed to join for a set period. )Tj
T*(Sometimes a married man was allowed to join if he had his wife's )Tj
T*(permission,[59] but he was not allowed to wear the white mantle.[69] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( With their military mission and extensive financial resources, the Knights )Tj
T*(Templar funded a large number of building projects around Europe and the Holy )Tj
T*(Land. Many of these structures are still standing. Many sites also maintain the )Tj
T*(name "Temple" because of centuries-old association with the Templars.[70] For )Tj
T*(example, some of the Templars' lands in London were later rented to lawyers, )Tj
T*(which led to the names of the Temple Bar gateway and the Temple tube station. )Tj
T*(Two of the four Inns of Court which may call members to act as barristers are )Tj
T*(the Inner Temple and Middle Temple. )Tj
T*( Distinctive architectural elements of Templar buildings include the use of the )Tj
T*(image of "two knights on a single horse", representing the Knights' poverty, )Tj
T*(and round buildings designed to resemble the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in )Tj
T*(Jerusalem.[71] )Tj
T*( [edit] Modern organizations )Tj
T*( The story of the secretive yet powerful medieval Templars, especially their )Tj
T*(persecution and sudden dissolution, has been a tempting source for many other )Tj
T*(groups which have used alleged connections with the Templars as a way of )Tj
T*(enhancing their own image and mystery.[72] There is no clear historical )Tj
T*(connection between the Knights Templar, which were dismantled in the Roll's of )Tj
T*(the Catholic Church in the 1309 with the martyrdom of Jacques de Molay, and any )Tj
T*(of the modern organizations, of which, except for the publicly known Scottish )Tj
T*(Order, the earliest emerged publicly in the 18th century.[73][74][75][76] )Tj
T*(However, there is often public confusion and many overlook the 400-year gap. )Tj
T*( [edit] Freemasonry )Tj
T*( Since at least the 18th century Freemasonry has incorporated Templar symbols )Tj
T*(and rituals in a number of Masonic bodies,[5] most notably, the "Order of the )Tj
T*(Temple" the final order joined in "The United Religious, Military and Masonic )Tj
T*(Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta" )Tj
T*(commonly known as the Knights Templar. One theory of the origins of Freemasonry )Tj
T*(claims direct descent from the historical Knights Templar through its final )Tj
T*(fourteenth-century members who took refuge in Scotland whose King, Robert the )Tj
T*(Bruce was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church at the time, or in Spain )Tj
T*(who for a time were called Knights of Christ Cross, other members having joined )Tj
T*(Knights of St.John There have even been claims that some of the Templars who )Tj
T*(made it to Scotland contributed to the Scots' victory at Bannockburn. This )Tj
T*(theory is usually deprecated on grounds of lack of evidence, by both Masonic )Tj
T*(authorities[77] and historians.[78] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legends and relics )Tj
T*( The Knights Templar have become associated with legends concerning secrets and )Tj
T*(mysteries handed down to the select from ancient times. Rumors circulated even )Tj
T*(during the time of the Templars themselves. Freemasonic writers added their own )Tj
T*(speculations in the 19th century, and further fictional embellishments have )Tj

T*(symbol, and The Da Vinci Code;[5] modern movies such as National Treasure and )Tj
T*(Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade; and video games such as Assassin's Creed )Tj
T*(and Broken Sword.[79] )Tj
T*( Many of the Templar legends are connected with the Order's early occupation of )Tj
T*(the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and speculation about what relics the Templars )Tj
T*(may have found there, such as the Holy Grail or the Ark of the )Tj
T*(Covenant.[5][15][66][80] That the Templars were in possession of some relics is )Tj
T*(certain. Many churches still display holy relics such as the bones of a saint, )Tj
T*(a scrap of cloth once worn by a holy man, or the skull of a martyr; the )Tj
T*(Templars did the same. They were documented as having a piece of the True )Tj
T*(Cross, which the Bishop of Acre carried into battle at the disastrous Horns of )Tj
T*(Hattin.[81] When the battle was lost, Saladin captured the relic, which was )Tj
T*(then ransomed back to the Crusaders when the Muslims surrendered the city of )Tj
T*(Acre in 1191.[82] The Templars were also known to possess the head of Saint )Tj
T*(Euphemia of Chalcedon,[83] and the subject of relics came up during the )Tj
T*(Inquisition of the Templars, as several trial documents refer to the worship of )Tj
T*(an idol of some type, referred to in some cases as a cat, a bearded head, or in )Tj
T*(some cases as Baphomet. This accusation of idol worship levied against the )Tj
T*(Templars has also led to the modern belief by some that the Templars practiced )Tj
T*(witchcraft.[84] However, modern scholars generally explain the name Baphomet )Tj
T*(from the trial documents as simply a French misspelling of the name Mahomet )Tj
T*(\(Muhammad\).[5][85] )Tj
T*( The Holy Grail quickly became associated with the Templars, even in the 12th )Tj
T*(century. The first Grail romance, Le Conte du Graal, was written around 1180 by )Tj
T*(Chr√©tien de Troyes, who came from the same area where the Council of Troyes had )Tj
T*(officially sanctioned the Templars' Order. Perhaps twenty years later Parzival, )Tj
T*(Wolfram von Eschenbach's version of the tale, refers to knights called )Tj
T*("Templeisen" guarding the Grail Kingdom.[86] Another hero of the Grail quest, )Tj
T*(Sir Galahad \(a 13th-century literary invention of monks from St. Bernard's )Tj
T*(Cistercian Order\) was depicted bearing a shield with the cross of Saint George, )Tj
T*(similar to the Templars' insignia: this version presented the "Holy" Grail as a )Tj
T*(Christian relic. A legend developed that since the Templars had their )Tj
T*(headquarters at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, they must have excavated in )Tj
T*(search of relics, found the Grail, and then proceeded to keep it in secret and )Tj
T*(guard it with their lives. However, in the extensive documents of the Templar )Tj
T*(inquisition there was never a single mention of anything like a Grail )Tj
T*(relic,[14] let alone its possession by the Templars, nor is there any evidence )Tj
T*(that a Templar wrote a Grail Romance.[87] In reality, most mainstream scholars )Tj
T*(agree that the story of the Grail was just that, a literary fiction that began )Tj
T*(circulating in medieval times.[5][15] )Tj
T*( Another legendary object that is claimed to have some connection with the )Tj
T*(Templars is the Shroud of Turin. In 1357, the shroud was first publicly )Tj
T*(displayed by a nobleman known as Geoffrey of Charney,[88] described by some )Tj
T*(sources as being a member of the family of the grandson of Geoffroi de Charney, )Tj
T*(who was burned at the stake with De Molay.[89] The shroud's origins are still a )Tj
T*(matter of controversy, but in 1988, a carbon dating analysis concluded that the )Tj
T*(shroud was made between 1260 and 1390, a span that includes the last )Tj
T*(half-century of the Templars' existence.[90] The validity of the dating )Tj
T*(methodology has subsequently been called into question, and the age of the )Tj
T*(shroud is still the subject of much debate[91] despite the existence of a 1389 )Tj
T*(Memorandum by Bishop Pierre D'Arcis to the Avignon Antipope Clement VII )Tj
T*(mentioning that the image had previously been denounced by his predecessor )Tj
T*(Henri de Poitiers \(Bishop of Troyes 1353-1370\), stating "Eventually, after )Tj
T*(diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered how the said cloth had been )Tj
T*(cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, )Tj
T*(to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or )Tj

T*( Ima Hogg \(July 10, 1882 ‚Äì August 19, 1975\), known as "The First Lady of )Tj
T*(Texas",[1] was an American philanthropist, patron and collector of the arts, )Tj
T*(and one of the most respected women in Texas during the 20th century.[2] Hogg )Tj
T*(was an avid art collector, and owned works by Picasso, Klee, and Matisse, among )Tj
T*(others. Hogg donated hundreds of pieces of artwork to Houston's Museum of Fine )Tj
T*(Arts and served on a committee to plan the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. )Tj
T*(An enthusiastic collector of early American antiques, she also served on a )Tj
T*(committee tasked with locating historical furniture for the White House. She )Tj
T*(restored and refurbished several properties, including the Varner plantation )Tj
T*(and Bayou Bend, which she later donated to Texas arts and historical )Tj
T*(institutions who maintain the facilities and their collections today. Hogg )Tj
T*(received numerous awards and honors, including the Louise E. du Pont )Tj
T*(Crowninshield Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the )Tj
T*(Santa Rita Award from the University of Texas System, and an honorary doctorate )Tj
T*(in fine arts from Southwestern University. )Tj
T*( Hogg was the daughter of Sarah Ann "Sallie" Stinson and James Stephen "Big )Tj
T*(Jim" Hogg, later Attorney General of Texas and Governor of the state. Ima )Tj
T*(Hogg's first name was taken from The Fate of Marvin, an epic poem written by )Tj
T*(her uncle Thomas Hogg. She endeavored to downplay her unusual name by signing )Tj
T*(her first name illegibly and having her stationery printed with "I. Hogg" or )Tj
T*("Miss Hogg". Although it was rumored that Hogg had a sister named "Ura Hogg", )Tj
T*(she had only brothers. Hogg's father left public office in 1895, and soon )Tj
T*(after, her mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis. When Sarah died later that )Tj
T*(year, Jim Hogg's widowed elder sister moved to Austin to care for the Hogg )Tj
T*(children. Between 1899 and 1901, Hogg attended the University of Texas at )Tj
T*(Austin; she then moved to New York City to study piano and music theory for two )Tj
T*(years. After her father's death in 1906, she traveled to Europe and spent two )Tj
T*(years studying music under Xaver Scharwenka in Vienna. When she returned to )Tj
T*(Texas, she established and managed the Houston Symphony Orchestra and served as )Tj

T*( The discovery of oil on her family's plantation made Hogg very wealthy, and )Tj
T*(she used this income to benefit the people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the )Tj
T*(Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for disturbed children )Tj
T*(and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg )Tj
T*(Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg )Tj
T*(successfully ran for a seat on the Houston School Board in 1943, where she )Tj
T*(worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and )Tj
T*(established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and )Tj
T*(died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, )Tj
T*(and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been )Tj
T*(established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in )Tj
T*(Texas. )Tj
T*( After the birth of his only daughter, Jim Hogg wrote to his brother, "Our cup )Tj
T*(of joy is now overflowing! We have a daughter of as fine proportions and of as )Tj
T*(angelic mien as ever gracious nature favor a man with, and her name is Ima!"[3] )Tj
T*(Ima Hogg had no middle name, which was unusual for the time.[4] Her first name )Tj
T*(was taken from her uncle Thomas Hogg's epic Civil War poem The Fate of Marvin, )Tj
T*(which featured two young women named Ima and Leila.[4][5][6] According to )Tj
T*(Virginia Bernhard's biography of Ima Hogg, "there are some who believe that )Tj
T*(James Stephen Hogg ... named his only daughter Ima Hogg to attract the )Tj
T*(attention of Texas voters" in a year when he was running in a close race for )Tj
T*(district attorney of the Seventh District in Texas,[3] which he won.[7][8] )Tj
T*(Alternatively, correspondence from Jim Hogg indicates he may not have been )Tj
T*(conscious of the combined effect of his daughter's first and last names.[9] )Tj
T*( Ima Hogg later recounted that "my grandfather Stinson lived fifteen miles [24¬†)Tj
T*(km] from Mineola and news traveled slowly. When he learned of his )Tj
T*(granddaughter's name he came trotting to town as fast as he could to protest )Tj
T*(but it was too late. The christening had taken place, and Ima I was to )Tj
T*(remain."[4] During her childhood, Hogg's elder brother William often came home )Tj
T*(from school with a bloody nose, the result of defending, as she later recalled, )Tj
T*("my good name".[10] Throughout her adult years, Hogg signed her name in a )Tj
T*(scrawl that left her first name illegible. Her personal stationery was usually )Tj
T*(printed "Miss Hogg" or "I. Hogg", and she often had her stationery order placed )Tj
T*(in her secretary's name to avoid questions. Hogg did not use a nickname until )Tj
T*(several months before her death, when she began calling herself "Imogene". Her )Tj
T*(last passport was issued to "Ima Imogene Hogg".[10] )Tj
T*( Contrary to popular belief, Ima did not have a sister named Ura.[11] Texas )Tj
T*(legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for re-election as Texas governor in 1892 )Tj
T*(he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his )Tj
T*(daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never )Tj
T*(happened.[12] She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people )Tj
T*(wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a )Tj
T*(sister named Ura.[10]The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, )Tj
T*(Hoosa.[13] )Tj
T*( In the early 1930s, Hogg worked on a collection of her father's papers and )Tj
T*(speeches with his biographer, historian Robert C. Cotner; she became a guardian )Tj
T*(of his place in history, often writing to clarify or refute articles published )Tj
T*(about her father. According to Bernhard, "the very fact that Ima had been )Tj
T*(burdened with a name that made a lifetime of explanations necessary also made )Tj
T*(her anxious to defend her father from all detractors. By doing so, she defended )Tj
T*(herself as well, and she did so with considerable skill and unfailing )Tj
T*(politeness."[14] )Tj
T*( Ima Hogg has been the source of "unfortunate name" or "worst baby name" jokes, )Tj
T*(lists, and contests,[15][16][17] including the incorrect lore that Jim Hogg had )Tj
T*(named his two daughters "Ima Hogg" and "Ura Hogg".[18][19] Similar unfortunate )Tj
T*(baby names according to United States Census records include Ima Pigg, Ima )Tj
T*(Muskrat, Ima Nut, Ima Hooker,[15] Ima Weiner, Ima Reck, Ima Pain and Ima )Tj

T*(Stinson. She was the second of four children, including brothers William )Tj
T*(Clifford Hogg \(1875‚Äì1930\), Michael Hogg \(1885‚Äì1941\), and Thomas Elisha Hogg )Tj
T*(\(1887‚Äì1949\).[11] The Hogg family had long been active in public service. Her )Tj
T*(great-grandfather, Thomas Hogg, served in the state legislatures of Georgia, )Tj
T*(Alabama, and Mississippi. Her grandfather, Joseph Lewis Hogg, served in the )Tj
T*(Congress of the Republic of Texas and helped to write the Texas State )Tj
T*(Constitution.[20] At the time of her birth, Hogg's father was the district )Tj
T*(attorney of the Seventh District in Texas.[21] His term expired in 1884, and )Tj
T*(the family moved to Tyler, where he practiced law. Two years later, Jim Hogg )Tj
T*(was elected Texas Attorney General and the Hogg family moved to the state )Tj
T*(capital, Austin, where Ima began attending kindergarten.[22] When Jim Hogg was )Tj
T*(elected the first native-born Governor of Texas four years later,[21] Ima )Tj
T*(accompanied her mother and elder brother to the swearing-in ceremony and )Tj
T*(inauguration ball in January 1891, thus witnessing the first inauguration in )Tj
T*(the newly erected Texas State Capitol.[23] The family moved into the Governor's )Tj
T*(Mansion. Built in 1855, the building was in poor condition, with cracked walls )Tj
T*(and dilapidated furnishings. Ima and her siblings were expected to help )Tj
T*(renovate the building to a liveable state‚Äîshe was required, among other things, )Tj
T*(to pry chewing gum from the furniture and door moldings.[24] )Tj
T*( Hogg and her younger brothers were rambunctious. She recalled that they )Tj
T*(particularly enjoyed sliding down the banisters in the Governor's Mansion. )Tj
T*(Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which )Tj
T*(Jim Hogg nailed tacks along the center of the railing to curb the activity )Tj
T*(through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible )Tj
T*(in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home.[25] )Tj
T*(Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but )Tj
T*(Hogg claimed that she "never had the patience to succeed".[25] Her mother also )Tj
T*(encouraged Hogg to learn German. Hogg and her siblings were frequently taken to )Tj
T*(the Millet Opera House in Austin to enjoy the performances.[26] )Tj
T*( The children liked animals, and their menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, )Tj
T*(raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and a parrot.[27] The children )Tj
T*(once used their animals to conduct a circus on the grounds of the Governor's )Tj
T*(Mansion. Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the )Tj
T*(money when her father discovered the scheme.[28] In later years, the family )Tj
T*(added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two ostriches named Jack and Jill )Tj
T*(to their collection of animals. In response to a challenge from her brothers, )Tj
T*(Hogg once mounted one of the ostriches, but was thrown from its back after one )Tj
T*(of the boys hit it with a slingshot.[29] Ima and her ostriches later became the )Tj
T*(protagonists of a picture book, Ima &amp; the Great Texas Ostrich Race, by )Tj
T*(Margaret Olivia McManis and Bruce Dupree.[30] )Tj
T*( Her mother never regained her strength after Thomas's birth, and for the )Tj
T*(remainder of her life was a semi-invalid.[25] Ima accompanied her to several )Tj
T*(health spas during their years in Austin.[31] In 1895, Sarah was diagnosed with )Tj
T*(tuberculosis, and on the recommendation of her doctor, she and Ima moved to )Tj
T*(Colorado, where they lived with Jim Hogg's elder sister, Martha Francis Davis. )Tj
T*(Sarah Hogg died in Colorado on September 25, 1895.[32] )Tj

T*(on the illness.[34] By the end of 1895, the children had been enrolled in a )Tj

T*( [edit] Education and musical interests )Tj
T*( Music was always present at the Hogg household, and Ima began learning to play )Tj
T*(the piano at age three.[22] Although her younger brothers attended public )Tj
T*(school, Ima was enrolled at a private school and received private music )Tj
T*(lessons.[36] In 1899, she entered the University of Texas at Austin \(UT\),[37] )Tj
T*(where her favorite courses were German, Old English, and psychology.[38] She )Tj
T*(later remarked that "No freshman was ever more immature, more unprepared, more )Tj
T*(frightened than I."[37] She joined the female social club known as the )Tj
T*(Valentine Club, and helped to inaugurate the first sorority on the UT campus, )Tj
T*(Pi Beta Phi. After two years at the university, she moved to New York City to )Tj
T*(study piano and music theory at the National Conservatory of Music.[37] )Tj
T*( Near the turn of the 20th century, Hogg's father began speculating in oil. He )Tj
T*(purchased 4,100 acres \(17¬†km2\) of land near West Columbia in 1901, land that )Tj
T*(had been part of the Varner plantation.[39] After two years of study in New )Tj
T*(York City, Ima Hogg returned to Texas, dividing her time between the plantation )Tj
T*(and Houston, where her father had a law practice.[40] Under her supervision, )Tj
T*(the house was later remodeled and a portico was added to what had been the back )Tj
T*(of the house; she made this the new front entrance, orienting the house away )Tj
T*(from Varner Creek.[41] )Tj
T*( On January 26, 1905, Jim Hogg suffered an injury in a train accident. For the )Tj
T*(next year Ima nursed him as he struggled to regain his health,[42] but on March )Tj
T*(3, 1906, she discovered her father dead in his bed.[43] Ima was devastated; to )Tj
T*(quell her grief, her brother William took her to New York City. During her stay )Tj
T*(she immersed herself in concerts and museums.[44] )Tj
T*( In 1907, she vacationed in Germany, and enjoyed her time so much that she )Tj
T*(chose to remain in Europe to continue her piano studies.[45] For the next two )Tj
T*(years she studied music in Vienna under Franz Xaver Scharwenka, pianist to the )Tj
T*(court of Francis Joseph I of Austria, and in Berlin under Martin Krause.[46] )Tj
T*(After returning from Europe, Hogg settled in Houston with her brother )Tj
T*(William.[47][48] Although the city had a population of about 100,000, it had no )Tj
T*(museums or parks and no professional theater, music, or ballet groups.[49] Hogg )Tj
T*(chose to teach music and continued in this vocation for the next nine years. )Tj
T*(One of her first pupils was Jacques Abram, who later became a concert )Tj
T*(pianist.[47] By 1913, Hogg had become president of the Girls' Musical Society )Tj
T*(and was on the entertainment committee of the College Women's Club, which )Tj
T*(organized a small theater group known as the Green Mask Players.[48] That year, )Tj
T*(she organized the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Hogg served as the vice-president )Tj
T*(of the Symphony Society when the first session of the Board of Directors )Tj
T*(convened.[50] In 1917 the Board of Directors requested that she serve as )Tj
T*(president; she went on to serve 12¬†terms.[51] )Tj
T*( [edit] Philanthropist and community leader )Tj
T*( Hogg was affectionately known as "Miss Ima" by those who knew her,[5] and )Tj
T*(widely considered to be "The First Lady of Texas".[1] When John B. Connally was )Tj
T*(Governor of Texas, his wife Nellie declared, "The Governor's wife is usually )Tj
T*(called the First Lady of the State, but Ima always has been and always will be )Tj
T*(the First Lady of Texas."[2] In 1957, The New York Times featured prominent )Tj
T*(Texans in a series about high society, stating: "But one social figure )Tj
T*(celebrated throughout the state and even beyond its border is Miss Ima Hogg. )Tj
T*(She is now about 80 but still a civic beacon of Houston."[52] )Tj
T*( After their father's death in 1906, Hogg and her brothers tried to sell the )Tj
T*(Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept )Tj
T*(for 15¬†years.[53] On January 15, 1918, oil was found on the Varner )Tj
T*(plantation.[54] A second strike the following year provided oil income )Tj
T*(amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings.[55] According to )Tj
T*(Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil )Tj
T*(money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, )Tj

T*(children's emotional and mental problems were treated, more serious illness )Tj
T*(could be prevented in adults.[56] Her interest in mental health came from her )Tj
T*(father, who had read widely on mental health issues; during his terms as )Tj
T*(governor, Ima had often accompanied him on visits to state institutions, )Tj
T*(including charity hospitals and asylums for the mentally ill.[57] She furthered )Tj
T*(her knowledge of the field while she was a student at UT, taking several )Tj
T*(courses in psychology.[58] Ima was convinced that her youngest brother, Tom, )Tj
T*(would have benefited from similar intervention, as he had reacted badly after )Tj
T*(their mother's death and as an adult was "restless, impulsive, and alarmingly )Tj
T*(careless with money".[59] Although her ideas on mental health would be )Tj
T*(considered mainstream today, in 1929 they were pioneering.[60] In 1972, she )Tj
T*(told the Houston Chronicle that, of all her activities, she had derived most )Tj
T*(pleasure from her role in establishing the Houston Child Guidance Center.[61] )Tj
T*( Hogg had previously suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she )Tj
T*(fell ill, probably from severe depression.[62] She consulted with Dr. Francis )Tj
T*(Xavier Dercum, a specialist in the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, )Tj
T*(who treated her for the next three years.[63] She was hospitalized for more )Tj
T*(than a year, and spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in )Tj
T*(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[47][64] By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully )Tj
T*(recovered,[64] but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert )Tj
T*(pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.[47] )Tj
T*( Hogg joined her elder brother William on a vacation in Germany in 1930. During )Tj
T*(their visit, he suffered a gallbladder attack and died on September 12, 1930 )Tj
T*(after emergency surgery. Ima brought her brother's body back to the United )Tj
T*(States.[60] His will bequeathed $2.5¬†million to UT; his desire was that it be )Tj
T*(used alongside money donated by his sister for "far-reaching benefit to the )Tj
T*(people of Texas".[55] Legal challenges tied up the grant until 1939, when the )Tj
T*(University received $1.8¬†million. In 1940, after discussion with her brother )Tj
T*(Michael‚Äîthe executor of the will‚ÄîHogg used the money to establish the Hogg )Tj
T*(Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin.[55] )Tj
T*( The San Antonio Express reported in 1939 that the funds granted to the Hogg )Tj
T*(Foundation for Mental Health would be used to establish mental hygiene clinics )Tj
T*(and conduct lectures and teacher training courses across Texas, for mental )Tj
T*(health research, and to survey mental hygiene conditions in Texas.[65] On the )Tj
T*(entry of the United States into World War II, the Foundation researched methods )Tj
T*(to prevent mentally unsuitable candidates from enlisting in the military, and )Tj
T*(provided counseling to those traumatized by the war. After the war, the )Tj
T*(Foundation expanded its educational and philanthropic focus, providing mental )Tj
T*(health care to the poor and the aged.[66] The Foundation continues to award )Tj
T*(five $5,000 annual scholarships to individuals pursuing a Master's degree in )Tj
T*(Social Work.[67] )Tj
T*( In 1943, Hogg decided to run for a seat on the Houston School Board so that )Tj
T*(the board would include two female members.[68] Hogg won with 4,350¬†votes, more )Tj
T*(than 1,000 ahead of the runner-up.[69] During her term, she worked to remove )Tj
T*(gender and race as criteria for determining pay.[70] She championed a visiting )Tj
T*(teacher program for children with emotional problems[69] and began art )Tj
T*(education programs in the schools for black students.[68] Hogg declined to run )Tj
T*(for a second term.[68] )Tj
T*( [edit] Furniture and art collector )Tj
T*( Hogg and her brothers were avid art collectors; she owned a large collection, )Tj
T*(including Native American art and works by Picasso, Chagall, Matisse and )Tj
T*(Modigliani.[71] Her interest in collecting began during her convalescence in )Tj
T*(Philadelphia.[64] Her first purchase, in 1922, was a Spanish foot chair or )Tj
T*(Queen Anne maple chair with carved feet.[72][73] She researched the early )Tj
T*(American furniture market extensively, personally visiting Luke Vincent )Tj
T*(Lockwood, the author of the standard work on the topic, for more )Tj
T*(information.[73] At the time, Hogg was one of a small number of people who )Tj
T*(believed that American antiques had value‚Äîby contrast, most collectors )Tj

T*(located on the East Coast. As her collection grew, she was often asked to loan )Tj
T*(pieces for exhibit in New England; Hogg always refused, stating "they've got )Tj
T*(plenty of these things up there".[75] )Tj
T*( In the 1920s, Hogg's brothers began to develop a new elite neighborhood, which )Tj
T*(they called River Oaks, on the outskirts of Houston.[76] For their home, the )Tj
T*(Hoggs chose the largest lot, 14.5 acres \(5.9¬†ha\). Ima worked closely with )Tj
T*(architect John Staub to design a house that would show off the art the family )Tj
T*(had purchased.[77][78] William and Ima moved into the house, which she )Tj
T*(christened Bayou Bend, in 1928.[78] In 1939, when she restored her estate along )Tj
T*(American lines,[71] she donated more than 100¬†works on paper to Houston's )Tj
T*(Museum of Fine Arts \(MFAH\), including works by C√©zanne, Sargent, Picasso, and )Tj
T*(Klee.[79] Following the death of her brother Michael in 1941, she donated his )Tj
T*(collection of Frederic Remington works to the museum. Consisting of 53 oil )Tj
T*(paintings, 10¬†watercolors, and one bronze, it is known as the Hogg Brothers )Tj
T*(Collection, and is "one of the most important groupings of Western paintings on )Tj
T*(display in an American museum", according to Hogg biographer Neely.[68] Hogg )Tj
T*(donated her collection of Native American art to MFAH in 1944,[79] including )Tj
T*(168 pieces of pottery, 95 pieces of jewelry, and 81¬†paintings.[80] )Tj
T*( In 1960, she was appointed by President Eisenhower to serve on a committee to )Tj
T*(plan the National Cultural Center, now called the Kennedy Center, in )Tj
T*(Washington, D.C.[81] In 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy named Hogg to the 18-member )Tj
T*(advisory committee to work with the Fine Arts Committee in seeking historical )Tj
T*(furniture for the White House.[82] )Tj
T*( [edit] Restorations )Tj
T*( Although Hogg spent little time at the Varner plantation after Bayou Bend was )Tj
T*(constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its )Tj
T*(behalf.[83] In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given )Tj
T*(a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, )Tj
T*(Napoleonic times \(1818\), and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. One room was dedicated )Tj
T*(to her father, and contained his desk and chair as well as his collection of )Tj
T*(walking sticks.[84] She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated )Tj
T*(as the Varner‚ÄìHogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th )Tj
T*(anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.[85] )Tj
T*( As the Varner‚ÄìHogg restoration wound to a halt, Hogg refocused her attention )Tj
T*(on her Houston home, Bayou Bend,[86] which housed some of her personal )Tj
T*(collection of antiques and artwork.[70]The New York Times described her "superb )Tj
T*(Early American furniture" collection in 1953,[87] and she had a large )Tj
T*(collection of Americana and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are )Tj
T*(still in the house.[88] In the late 1950s she said: "I had been collecting )Tj
T*(American furniture. I collected, and collected, and collected, until I had so )Tj
T*(much of it I didn't know what to do with it. I decided to give it to a )Tj
T*(museum."[89] She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on )Tj
T*(structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum.[90] She denuded )Tj
T*(the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only )Tj
T*(piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which )Tj
T*(had too many memories for her to remove it.[91] )Tj
T*( Several residents of River Oaks sued to prevent Bayou Bend becoming a museum, )Tj
T*(but Hogg prevailed in court.[92] To alleviate the residents' concerns over )Tj
T*(increased traffic, she asked the city of Houston to build a footbridge over )Tj
T*(Buffalo Bayou so that visitors could reach the house without having to drive )Tj
T*(through River Oaks.[86] In the fall of 1965, Hogg moved out of her home,[91] )Tj
T*(telling the docents that "When you love something enough it's easy to give it )Tj
T*(up in order to see it go on."[93] The MFAH opened the new museum to the public )Tj
T*(in 1966 as MFAH's Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens.[79] At its dedication, )Tj
T*(Charles Montgomery, a Senior Research Fellow at the Henry Francis DuPont )Tj
T*(Winterthur Museum, called Bayou Bend "the largest, finest collection this side )Tj
T*(of Winterthur".[75] )Tj
T*( In 1963, Hogg purchased property near Round Top, hoping to move its historic )Tj
T*(building to Bayou Bend. When that plan proved impractical, she decided to )Tj

T*(personally supervising the restoration of the Winedale Inn, a stagecoach inn )Tj
T*(near Round Top, Hogg donated the property to the University of Texas at Austin. )Tj
T*(Known as the Winedale Historical Center, it is used primarily as an outdoor )Tj
T*(museum and music center,[70] and annually hosts Shakespeare at Winedale. In )Tj
T*(1969, she restored her parents' house in Quitman; the town renamed it the Ima )Tj
T*(Hogg Museum in her honor.[96] The museum holds items from the history of Wood )Tj
T*(County and northeast Texas.[97] She later restored the home of her maternal )Tj
T*(grandfather and had it moved to the park.[98] )Tj
T*( [edit] Description and disposition )Tj
T*( David Warren, the first curator of Bayou Bend, said Hogg was "small and dainty )Tj
T*(and feminine‚Äîand smart and sharp and knowledgeable‚Äîall rolled into one".[99] )Tj
T*(Her biographer Bernhard described her as "elegantly and stylishly dressed", 5¬†)Tj
T*(feet 2¬†inches \(157¬†cm\) tall and of fair complexion,[100] "independent and )Tj
T*(self-possessed"[51] and noted that she could "sugarcoat her single-mindedness )Tj
T*(with layers of charm".[101] At the age of 81, she was described by The New York )Tj
T*(Times as a "blue-eyed strawberry blonde".[71] )Tj
T*( One morning in 1914,[51] Hogg was awakened by a burglar in her bedroom. She )Tj
T*(confronted the man, who was attempting to steal her jewelry, and not only )Tj
T*(convinced him to return the jewelry, but "wrote down a name and address, handed )Tj
T*(it to him and told him to go there that very day to get a job".[102] When asked )Tj
T*(why she did that, Hogg responded, "He didn't look like a bad man."[102] Later )Tj
T*(that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz )Tj
T*(Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain )Tj
T*(declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg )Tj
T*(continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.[51] )Tj
T*( Though Bernard describes Hogg as a woman of "unfailing politeness",[14] the )Tj
T*(biographer suggests the philanthropist was not without adversaries. For )Tj
T*(instance, at a concert arranged by the Houston Symphony for her 90th birthday )Tj
T*(featuring the elderly pianist Arthur Rubinstein,[70] he characterized her as a )Tj
T*("tiresome old woman". Hogg, in turn, regarded the musician as "a pompous old )Tj
T*(man". By contrast, Hogg said of Vladimir Horowitz, whom she met backstage at a )Tj
T*(1975 concert in Houston, "Such a nice man. Not at all like that Mr. )Tj
T*(Rubinstein."[103] )Tj
T*( Hogg was a generous benefactor, and believed that "inherited money was a )Tj
T*(public trust". She was described by the University of Houston as "compassionate )Tj
T*(by nature", "progressive in outlook", "concerned with the welfare of all )Tj
T*(Texans", a "zealous proponent of mental health care" and "committed to public )Tj
T*(education".[104] Hogg was a lifelong Democrat.[14] )Tj
T*( Hogg died on August 19, 1975, at the age of 93, from a heart attack resulting )Tj
T*(from atheroma. She had been vacationing in London at the time, but fell as she )Tj
T*(was getting into a taxi, and died a few days later in a London hospital. An )Tj
T*(autopsy report revealed that her death was not related to the earlier )Tj
T*(fall.[2][105] On receiving news of her death, the University of Texas declared )Tj
T*(two days of mourning and flew the flag at half-staff.[106] )Tj
T*( At the time of her death, Hogg had employed her personal maid, Gertrude )Tj
T*(Vaughn, for 56¬†years, and her butler-chauffeur, Lucious Broadnax, for over 40¬†)Tj
T*(years.[106][107] She is buried next to her family in the Oakwood Cemetery in )Tj
T*(Austin.[106] Hogg's work lives on through the Ima Hogg Foundation, which she )Tj
T*(founded in 1964 and which was the major beneficiary of her will.[5] Hogg never )Tj
T*(married; her biographer Bernhard reports that she told a friend "she had gotten )Tj
T*(over 30 proposals of marriage but 'wouldn't have any of them'".[108] )Tj
T*( [edit] Awards, recognition and legacy )Tj
T*( Hogg received many awards for her contributions to the community. The Garden )Tj
T*(Club of America honored her in 1959 with the Amy Angell Colliers Montague Model )Tj
T*(for Civic Achievement.[109] In 1966, she was honored at the 20th annual awards )Tj

T*( Aikido \(Japanese: ÂêàÊ∞óÈÅì, Hepburn: Aikid≈ç?\) [a.i.ki.doÀê] is a Japanese martial )Tj
T*(art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, )Tj
T*(philosophy, and religious beliefs. Aikido is often translated as "the Way of )Tj
T*(unifying \(with\) life energy"[1] or as "the Way of harmonious spirit."[2] )Tj
T*(Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend )Tj
T*(themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury.[3][4] )Tj
T*( Aikido is performed by blending with the motion of the attacker and )Tj
T*(redirecting the force of the attack rather than opposing it head-on. This )Tj
T*(requires very little physical strength, as the aikid≈çka \(aikido practitioner\) )Tj
T*("leads" the attacker's momentum using entering and turning movements. The )Tj
T*(techniques are completed with various throws or joint locks.[5] )Tj
T*( Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of Dait≈ç-ry≈´ Aiki-j≈´jutsu, but )Tj
T*(began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement )Tj
T*(with the ≈åmoto-ky≈ç religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term )Tj
T*(aiki-j≈´jutsu.[6] )Tj
T*( Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending )Tj
T*(partly on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found all over the world )Tj
T*(in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. )Tj
T*(However, they all share techniques learned from Ueshiba and most have concern )Tj
T*(for the well-being of the attacker. )Tj

T*(  The term "aiki" does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the )Tj
T*(scope of Budo. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word. Âêà is )Tj
T*(mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', )Tj
T*(examples being ÂêàÂêå \(combined/united\), ÂêàÊàê \(composition\), ÁµêÂêà )Tj
T*(\(unite/combine/join together\), ÈÄ£Âêà \(union/alliance/association\), Áµ±Âêà )Tj

T*(and ÂæÖ„Å°Âêà„Çè„Åõ„Çã \(meet by appointment\). )Tj
T*( Ê∞ó is often used to express a feeling, as in Ê∞ó„Åå„Åô„Çã \('I feel', as in terms )Tj
T*(of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning\), Ê∞óÊåÅ„Å° \(feeling/sensation\), and )Tj
T*(Ê∞óÂàÜ \(mood/morale\). It is used to mean energy or force, as in ÈõªÊ∞ó )Tj
T*(\(electricity\) and Á£ÅÊ∞ó \(magnetism\). )Tj
T*( The term d≈ç is also found in martial arts such as judo and kendo, and in the )Tj
T*(more peaceful arts such as Japanese calligraphy \(shod≈ç\), flower arranging )Tj
T*(\(kad≈ç\) and tea ceremony \(chad≈ç or sad≈ç\). )Tj
T*( Therefore, from a purely linguistic point of view, aikido is 'Way of combining )Tj
T*(forces'. The term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of )Tj
T*(blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their )Tj
T*(actions with minimal effort.[7] One applies aiki by understanding the rhythm )Tj
T*(and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a )Tj
T*(counter-technique. This then is very similar to the principles expressed by )Tj
T*(Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, founder of judo. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba \(Ê§çËäù ÁõõÂπ≥ Ueshiba Morihei, 14 December )Tj
T*(1883¬†‚Äì 26 April 1969\), referred to by some aikido practitioners as ≈åsensei )Tj
T*(\("Great Teacher"\).[8] Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of )Tj
T*(his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of )Tj
T*(universal peace and reconciliation. During Ueshiba's lifetime and continuing )Tj
T*(today, aikido has evolved from the Aiki that Ueshiba studied into a wide )Tj
T*(variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Initial development )Tj
T*( Ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s )Tj
T*(through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied.[9] The )Tj
T*(core martial art from which aikido derives is Dait≈ç-ry≈´ aiki-j≈´jutsu, which )Tj
T*(Ueshiba studied directly with Takeda S≈çkaku, the reviver of that art. )Tj
T*(Additionally, Ueshiba is known to have studied Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ with Tozawa )Tj
T*(Tokusabur≈ç in Tokyo in 1901, Got≈çha Yagy≈´ Shingan-ry≈´ under Nakai Masakatsu in )Tj
T*(Sakai from 1903 to 1908, and judo with Kiyoichi Takagi \(È´òÊú® Âñú‰ª£Â≠ê Takagi )Tj
T*(Kiyoichi, 1894‚Äì1972\) in Tanabe in 1911.[10] )Tj
T*( The art of Dait≈ç-ry≈´ is the primary technical influence on aikido. Along with )Tj
T*(empty-handed throwing and joint-locking techniques, Ueshiba incorporated )Tj
T*(training movements with weapons, such as those for the spear \(yari\), short )Tj
T*(staff \(j≈ç\), and perhaps the bayonet \(ÈäÉÂâ£, j≈´ken?\). However, aikido derives )Tj
T*(much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship \(kenjutsu\).[2] )Tj
T*( Ueshiba moved to Hokkaid≈ç in 1912, and began studying under Takeda Sokaku in )Tj
T*(1915. His official association with Dait≈ç-ry≈´ continued until 1937.[9] However, )Tj
T*(during the latter part of that period, Ueshiba had already begun to distance )Tj
T*(himself from Takeda and the Dait≈ç-ry≈´. At that time Ueshiba was referring to )Tj
T*(his martial art as "Aiki Bud≈ç". It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using )Tj
T*(the name "aikido", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the )Tj
T*(Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society \(Dai Nippon Butoku Kai\) was engaged in a )Tj
T*(government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial )Tj
T*(arts.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Religious influences )Tj
T*( After Ueshiba left Hokkaid≈ç in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by )Tj
T*(Onisaburo Deguchi, the spiritual leader of the ≈åmoto-ky≈ç religion \(a neo-Shinto )Tj
T*(movement\) in Ayabe.[11] One of the primary features of ≈åmoto-ky≈ç is its )Tj
T*(emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great )Tj
T*(influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion )Tj

T*(especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this )Tj
T*(philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an )Tj
T*(attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the )Tj
T*(receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.[12] )Tj
T*( In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi )Tj
T*(gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. )Tj
T*(As a result of this exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing )Tj
T*(but also gifted students. Several of these students would found their own )Tj
T*(styles of aikido.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] International dissemination )Tj
T*( Aikido was first brought to the rest of the world in 1951 by Minoru Mochizuki )Tj
T*(with a visit to France where he introduced aikido techniques to judo )Tj
T*(students.[14] He was followed by Tadashi Abe in 1952 who came as the official )Tj
T*(Aikikai Hombu representative, remaining in France for seven years. Kenji Tomiki )Tj
T*(toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states )Tj
T*(of the United States in 1953.[13] Later in that year, Koichi Tohei was sent by )Tj
T*(Aikikai Hombu to Hawaii, for a full year, where he set up several dojo. This )Tj
T*(was followed up by several further visits and is considered the formal )Tj
T*(introduction of aikido to the United States. The United Kingdom followed in )Tj
T*(1955; Italy in 1964; and Germany 1965. Designated "Official Delegate for Europe )Tj
T*(and Africa" by Morihei Ueshiba, Masamichi Noro arrived in France in September )Tj

T*(exhibited in Hollywood films by Steven Seagal in the 1990s. )Tj
T*( [edit] Proliferation of independent organizations )Tj
T*( The largest aikido organization is the Aikikai Foundation which remains under )Tj
T*(the control of the Ueshiba family. However, aikido has many styles, mostly )Tj
T*(formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.[13] )Tj
T*( The earliest independent styles to emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by )Tj
T*(Minoru Mochizuki in 1931,[14]Yoshinkan Aikido founded by Gozo Shioda in )Tj
T*(1955,[15] and Shodokan Aikido, founded by Kenji Tomiki in 1967.[16] The )Tj
T*(emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major )Tj
T*(upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was )Tj
T*(controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some )Tj
T*(felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.[13] )Tj
T*( After Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant )Tj
T*(controversy arose with the departure of the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief )Tj
T*(instructor Koichi Tohei, in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with )Tj
T*(the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, who at that time headed the Aikikai )Tj
T*(Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ki development in )Tj
T*(regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called Shin )Tj
T*(Shin Toitsu Aikido, and the organization which governs it, the Ki Society \(Ki )Tj
T*(no Kenky≈´kai\).[17] )Tj
T*( A final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in Iwama, Ibaraki, and )Tj
T*(the teaching methodology of long term student Morihiro Saito. It is )Tj
T*(unofficially referred to as the "Iwama style", and at one point a number of its )Tj
T*(followers formed a loose network of schools they called Iwama Ryu. Although )Tj
T*(Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in )Tj
T*(2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups; one remaining with )Tj
T*(the Aikikai and the other forming the independent Shinshin Aikishuren Kai in )Tj
T*(2004 around Saito's son Hitohiro Saito. )Tj
T*( Today, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing )Tj
T*(organization, have their own headquarters \(Êú¨ÈÉ®ÈÅìÂ†¥, honbu d≈çj≈ç?\) in Japan, and )Tj
T*(have an international breadth.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Training )Tj
T*( In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical )Tj
T*(and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, )Tj

T*(the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques )Tj
T*(are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and )Tj
T*(techniques with weapons. )Tj
T*( [edit] Fitness )Tj
T*( Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled )Tj
T*(relaxation, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength )Tj
T*(training. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than )Tj
T*(pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general )Tj
T*(fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.[2] )Tj
T*( In aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to )Tj
T*(improve tone, mass, and power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of )Tj
T*(coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates. For )Tj
T*(example, many dojos begin each class with warm-up exercises \(Ê∫ñÂÇô‰ΩìÊìç, junbi )Tj
T*(tais≈ç?\), which may include stretching and ukemi \(break falls\).[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Roles of uke and nage )Tj
T*( Aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged )Tj
T*(forms \(kata\) rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the )Tj
T*(receiver of the technique \(uke\) to initiate an attack against the person who )Tj
T*(applies the technique‚Äîthe Âèñ„Çä tori, or shite ‰ªïÊâã \(depending on aikido style\), )Tj
T*(also referred to as Êäï„Åí nage \(when applying a throwing technique\), who )Tj
T*(neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.[20] )Tj
T*( Both halves of the technique, that of uke and that of nage, are considered )Tj
T*(essential to aikido training.[20] Both are studying aikido principles of )Tj
T*(blending and adaptation. Nage learns to blend with and control attacking )Tj
T*(energy, while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, )Tj
T*(off-balance positions in which nage places them. This "receiving" of the )Tj
T*(technique is called ukemi.[20]Uke continuously seeks to regain balance and )Tj
T*(cover vulnerabilities \(e.g., an exposed side\), while nage uses position and )Tj
T*(timing to keep uke off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, uke )Tj
T*(will sometimes apply reversal techniques \(Ëøî„ÅóÊäÄ, kaeshi-waza?\) to regain )Tj
T*(balance and pin or throw nage. )Tj
T*( Ukemi \(ÂèóË∫´?\) refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ukemi involves )Tj
T*(attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment‚Äîit is an )Tj
T*(active rather than a passive receiving of aikido. The fall itself is part of )Tj
T*(aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would )Tj
T*(otherwise be a devastating strike or throw. )Tj
T*( [edit] Initial attacks )Tj
T*( Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must )Tj
T*(learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a )Tj
T*(partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based )Tj
T*(arts, "honest" attacks \(a strong strike or an immobilizing grab\) are needed to )Tj
T*(study correct and effective application of technique.[2] )Tj
T*( Many of the strikes \(Êâì„Å°, uchi?\) of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or )Tj
T*(other grasped object, which indicates its origins in techniques intended for )Tj
T*(armed combat.[2] Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches )Tj
T*(\(tsuki\), are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword. Kicks are generally )Tj
T*(reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from )Tj
T*(kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks \(high kicks in particular\) were )Tj
T*(uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic )Tj
T*(strikes include: )Tj
T*( Front-of-the-head strike \(Ê≠£Èù¢Êâì„Å°, sh≈çmen'uchi?\) a vertical knifehand strike )Tj
T*(to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the crown )Tj
T*(for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the )Tj
T*(nose and the maxillary sinus.)Tj
T*(Side-of-the-head strike \(Ê®™Èù¢Êâì„Å°, yokomen'uchi?\) a diagonal knifehand strike )Tj
T*(to the side of the head or neck.)Tj
T*(Chest thrust \(ËÉ∏Á™Å„Åç, mune-tsuki?\) a punch to the torso. Specific targets )Tj
T*(include the chest, abdomen, and solar plexus. Same as "middle-level thrust" )Tj

T*( The following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. )Tj
T*(Many of these techniques derive from Dait≈ç-ry≈´ Aiki-j≈´jutsu, but some others )Tj
T*(were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary )Tj
T*(between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the )Tj
T*(Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques )Tj
T*(listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.[21] )Tj
T*( First technique \(‰∏ÄÊïô, ikky≈ç?\) a control using one hand on the elbow and one )Tj
T*(hand near the wrist which leverages uke to the ground.[22] This grip applies )Tj
T*(pressure into the ulnar nerve at the wrist.)Tj
T*(Second technique \(‰∫åÊïô, niky≈ç?\) a pronating wristlock that torques the arm and )Tj
T*(applies painful nerve pressure. \(There is an adductive wristlock or Z-lock in )Tj
T*(ura version.\))Tj
T*(Third technique \(‰∏âÊïô, sanky≈ç?\) a rotational wristlock that directs )Tj
T*(upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder.)Tj
T*(Fourth technique \(ÂõõÊïô, yonky≈ç?\) a shoulder control similar to ikky≈ç, but with )Tj
T*(both hands gripping the forearm. The knuckles \(from the palm side\) are applied )Tj
T*(to the recipient's radial nerve against the periosteum of the forearm bone.[23])Tj
T*(Fifth technique \(‰∫îÊïô, goky≈ç?\) visually similar to ikky≈ç, but with an inverted )Tj
T*(grip of the wrist, medial rotation of the arm and shoulder, and downward )Tj
T*(pressure on the elbow. Common in knife and other weapon take-aways.)Tj
T*(Four-direction throw \(ÂõõÊñπÊäï„Åí, shih≈çnage?\) The hand is folded back past the )Tj
T*(shoulder, locking the shoulder joint.)Tj
T*(Forearm return \(Â∞èÊâãËøî„Åó, kotegaeshi?\) a supinating wristlock-throw that )Tj
T*(stretches the extensor digitorum.)Tj
T*(Breath throw \(ÂëºÂê∏Êäï„Åí, koky≈´nage?\) a loosely used term for various types of )Tj
T*(mechanically unrelated techniques, although they generally do not use joint )Tj
T*(locks like other techniques.[24])Tj
T*(Entering throw \(ÂÖ•Ë∫´Êäï„Åí, iriminage?\) throws in which nage moves through the )Tj
T*(space occupied by uke. The classic form superficially resembles a "clothesline" )Tj
T*(technique.)Tj
T*(Heaven-and-earth throw \(Â§©Âú∞Êäï„Åí, tenchinage?\) beginning with ry≈çte-dori; )Tj
T*(moving forward, nage sweeps one hand low \("earth"\) and the other high )Tj
T*(\("heaven"\), which unbalances uke so that he or she easily topples over.)Tj
T*(Hip throw \(ËÖ∞Êäï„Åí, koshinage?\) aikido's version of the hip throw. Nage drops )Tj
T*(his or her hips lower than those of uke, then flips uke over the resultant )Tj

T*( [edit] Implementations )Tj
T*( Aikido makes use of body movement \(tai sabaki\) to blend with uke. For example, )Tj
T*(an "entering" \(irimi\) technique consists of movements inward towards uke, while )Tj
T*(a "turning" \(Ëª¢Êèõ, tenkan?\) technique uses a pivoting motion.[27] Additionally, )Tj
T*(an "inside" \(ÂÜÖ, uchi?\) technique takes place in front of uke, whereas an )Tj
T*("outside" \(Â§ñ, soto?\) technique takes place to his side; a "front" \(Ë°®, omote?\) )Tj
T*(technique is applied with motion to the front of uke, and a "rear" \(Ë£è, ura?\) )Tj
T*(version is applied with motion towards the rear of uke, usually by )Tj
T*(incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be )Tj
T*(performed while in a seated posture \(seiza\). Techniques where both uke and nage )Tj
T*(are standing are called tachi-waza, techniques where both start off in seiza )Tj
T*(are called suwari-waza, and techniques performed with uke standing and nage )Tj
T*(sitting are called hanmi handachi.[28] )Tj
T*( Thus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible )Tj
T*(implementations. For instance, ikky≈ç can be applied to an opponent moving )Tj
T*(forward with a strike \(perhaps with an ura type of movement to redirect the )Tj
T*(incoming force\), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving )Tj
T*(back to reestablish distance \(perhaps an omote-waza version\). Specific aikido )Tj
T*(kata are typically referred to with the formula )Tj
T*("attack-technique\(-modifier\)".[29] For instance, katate-dori ikky≈ç refers to )Tj
T*(any ikky≈ç technique executed when uke is holding one wrist. This could be )Tj
T*(further specified as katate-dori ikky≈ç omote, referring to any forward-moving )Tj
T*(ikky≈ç technique from that grab. )Tj
T*( Atemi \(ÂΩì„Å¶Ë∫´\) are strikes \(or feints\) employed during an aikido technique. )Tj
T*(Some view atemi as attacks against "vital points" meant to cause damage in and )Tj
T*(of themselves. For instance, G≈çz≈ç Shioda described using atemi in a brawl to )Tj
T*(quickly down a gang's leader.[30] Others consider atemi, especially to the )Tj
T*(face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques. A strike, )Tj
T*(whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her )Tj
T*(concentration. The target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the )Tj
T*(blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier )Tj
T*(throw.[28] Many sayings about atemi are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who )Tj
T*(considered them an essential element of technique.[31] )Tj
T*( [edit] Weapons )Tj
T*( Weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff \(j≈ç\), wooden )Tj
T*(sword \(bokken\), and knife \(tant≈ç\).[32] Today, some schools incorporate )Tj
T*(firearm-disarming techniques. Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are )Tj
T*(sometimes taught, to integrate armed and unarmed aspects. Others, such as the )Tj
T*(Iwama style of Morihiro Saito, usually spend substantial time with bokken and )Tj
T*(j≈ç, practised under the names aiki-ken, and aiki-j≈ç, respectively. )Tj
T*( The founder developed much of empty handed aikido from traditional sword and )Tj
T*(spear movements. Consequently, the practice of these movements both gives )Tj
T*(insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the )Tj
T*(concepts of distance, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's )Tj
T*(training partner\(s\).[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Multiple attackers and randori )Tj
T*( One feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often )Tj
T*(called taninzudori, or taninzugake. Freestyle \(randori, or jiy≈´waza\) practice )Tj
T*(with multiple attackers is a key part of most curricula and is required for the )Tj
T*(higher level ranks.[34] "Randori", literally "chaos", exercises a person's )Tj
T*(ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.[34] )Tj
T*(Strategic choice of techniques, based on how they reposition the student )Tj
T*(relative to other attackers, is important in randori training. For instance, an )Tj
T*(ura technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to )Tj
T*(face attackers approaching from behind.[2] )Tj
T*( In Shodokan Aikido, randori differs in that it is not performed with multiple )Tj
T*(persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, )Tj
T*(where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it )Tj
T*(resembles judo randori.[16] )Tj

T*( In applying a technique during training, it is the responsibility of nage to )Tj
T*(prevent injury to uke by employing a speed and force of application that is )Tj
T*(commensurate with their partner's proficiency in ukemi.[20] Injuries )Tj
T*(\(especially those to the joints\), when they do occur in aikido, are often the )Tj
T*(result of nage misjudging the ability of uke to receive the throw or )Tj
T*(pin.[35][36] )Tj
T*( A study of injuries in the martial arts showed that while the type of injuries )Tj
T*(varied considerably from one art to the other, the differences in overall rates )Tj
T*(of injury were much less pronounced. Soft tissue injuries are one of the most )Tj
T*(common types of injuries found within aikido, and a few deaths from repetitive )Tj
T*("shih≈çnage" in a Japanese-style hazing context have been reported.[35][36][37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Mental training )Tj
T*( Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to )Tj
T*(relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.[38] This )Tj
T*(is necessary to enable the practitioner to perform the bold enter-and-blend )Tj
T*(movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with )Tj
T*(confidence and directness.[39] Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one "must be )Tj
T*(willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in )Tj
T*(order to execute techniques without hesitation.[40] As a martial art concerned )Tj
T*(not only with fighting proficiency but with the betterment of daily life, this )Tj
T*(mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.[41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Criticisms )Tj
T*( The most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism )Tj
T*(in training. The attacks initiated by uke \(and which nage must defend against\) )Tj
T*(have been criticized as being "weak," "sloppy," and "little more than )Tj
T*(caricatures of an attack."[42][43] Weak attacks from uke cause a conditioned )Tj
T*(response from nage, and result in underdevelopment of the strength and )Tj
T*(conditioning needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners.[42] )Tj
T*(To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over )Tj
T*(time but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having )Tj
T*(demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training )Tj
T*(partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive )Tj
T*(format.[16] Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining )Tj
T*(that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are )Tj
T*(unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defence or combat )Tj
T*(effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.[44] )Tj
T*( Another criticism is that after the end of Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from )Tj
T*(1942 to the mid-1950s, he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and )Tj
T*(philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by nage, )Tj
T*(entering \(irimi\) and initiation of techniques by nage, the distinction between )Tj
T*(omote \(front side\) and ura \(back side\) techniques, and the use of weapons, were )Tj
T*(all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Lack of training in these areas )Tj
T*(is thought to lead to an overall loss of effectiveness by some aikido )Tj
T*(practitioners.[45] )Tj
T*( Conversely, there are some who criticize aikido practitioners for not placing )Tj
T*(enough importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. The premise )Tj
T*(of this criticism is that "O-Sensei‚Äôs aikido was not a continuation and )Tj
T*(extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and )Tj
T*(philosophical concepts."[46] That is, that aikido practitioners who focus on )Tj
T*(aikido's roots in traditional jujutsu or kenjutsu are diverging from what )Tj
T*(Ueshiba taught. Such critics urge practitioners to embrace the assertion that )Tj
T*("[Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality was the )Tj
T*(fundamentals [sic] of the paradigm that he demonstrated."[46] )Tj
T*( The study of ki is a critical component of aikido, and its study defies )Tj
T*(categorization as either "physical" or "mental" training, as it encompasses )Tj
T*(both. The original kanji for ki was Ê∞£, and is a symbolic representation of a )Tj
T*(lid covering a pot full of rice; the "nourishing vapors" contained within are )Tj
T*(ki.[47] )Tj
T*( The character for ki is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as "health" )Tj
T*(\(ÂÖÉÊ∞ó, genki?\), or "shyness" \(ÂÜÖÊ∞ó, uchiki?\). Ki is most often understood as )Tj

T*(unified physical and mental intention, however in traditional martial arts it )Tj
T*(is often discussed as "life energy". G≈çz≈ç Shioda's Yoshinkan Aikido, considered )Tj
T*(one of the "hard styles," largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World )Tj
T*(War II, and surmises that the secret to ki lies in timing and the application )Tj
T*(of the whole body's strength to a single point.[30] In later years, Ueshiba's )Tj
T*(application of ki in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This was his )Tj
T*(Takemusu Aiki and many of his later students teach about ki from this )Tj
T*(perspective. Koichi Tohei's Ki Society centers almost exclusively around the )Tj
T*(study of the empirical \(albeit subjective\) experience of ki with students )Tj
T*(ranked separately in aikido techniques and ki development.[48] )Tj
T*( [edit] Uniforms and ranking )Tj
T*( Aikido practitioners \(commonly called aikid≈çka outside of Japan\) generally )Tj
T*(progress by promotion through a series of "grades" \(ky≈´\), followed by a series )Tj
T*(of "degrees" \(dan\), pursuant to formal testing procedures. Some aikido )Tj
T*(organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply )Tj
T*(white and black belts to distinguish lower and higher grades, though some use )Tj
T*(various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one )Tj
T*(organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.[2] )Tj
T*(Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a dan rank unless )Tj
T*(they are 16 or older. )Tj
T*( The uniform worn for practicing aikido \(aikid≈çgi\) is similar to the training )Tj
T*(uniform \(keikogi\) used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a )Tj
T*(wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick \("judo-style"\), and thin )Tj
T*(\("karate-style"\) cotton tops are used.[2] Aikido-specific tops are available )Tj
T*(with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow. )Tj
T*( Most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called )Tj
T*(a hakama. In many styles, its use is reserved for practitioners with \(dan\) )Tj
T*(ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners or female )Tj
T*(practitioners to wear a hakama regardless of rank.[2] )Tj

T*( Roman Vishniac \(pron.: /Ààv…™ Éni.√¶k/; Russian: –†–æ–º–∞–Ω –í–∏—à–Ω—è–∫; August 19, 1897 ‚Äì )Tj
T*(January 22, 1990\) was a Russian-American photographer, best known for capturing )Tj
T*(on film the culture of Jews in Central and Eastern Europe before the Holocaust. )Tj
T*(A complete archive of his work now rests at the International Center of )Tj
T*(Photography.[1][2] )Tj
T*( Vishniac was a versatile photographer, an accomplished biologist, an art )Tj
T*(collector and teacher of art history. He also made significant scientific )Tj
T*(contributions to photomicroscopy and time-lapse photography. Vishniac was very )Tj
T*(interested in history, especially that of his ancestors, and strongly attached )Tj
T*(to his Jewish roots; he was a Zionist later in life.[3] )Tj
T*( Roman Vishniac won international acclaim for his photos of shtetlach and )Tj
T*(Jewish ghettos, celebrity portraits, and microscopic biology. His book A )Tj
T*(Vanished World, published in 1983, made him famous and is one of the most )Tj
T*(detailed pictorial documentations of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe in the )Tj
T*(1930s.[2] Vishniac was also remembered for his humanism and respect for life, )Tj
T*(sentiments that can be seen in all aspects of his work. )Tj
T*( [edit] Biography )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Vishniac was born in his grandparents' dacha outside Saint Petersburg, in the )Tj
T*(town of Pavlovsk, and grew up in Moscow.[4] To live in this city was a right )Tj
T*(granted to few Jews but the Vishniac family lived there because Solomon )Tj
T*(Vishniac, Roman's father, was a wealthy manufacturer of umbrellas, and his )Tj
T*(mother, Manya, was the daughter of affluent diamond dealers. Vishniac also had )Tj
T*(a sister, Katja.[5] During the summer months, the Vishniac family left Moscow, )Tj
T*(as it became uncomfortably hot, and they retreated to a dacha a few miles )Tj
T*(outside the city. )Tj
T*( As a child, Vishniac was fascinated by biology and photography, and his room )Tj
T*(was filled with "plants, insects, fish and small animals".[6] On his seventh )Tj
T*(birthday, he got a microscope from his grandmother, to which he promptly hooked )Tj
T*(up a camera, and by which he photographed the muscles in a cockroach's leg at )Tj
T*(150 times magnification. Young Vishniac used this microscope extensively, )Tj
T*(viewing and photographing everything he could find, from dead insects to animal )Tj
T*(scales, to pollen and protozoa.[3] )Tj
T*( Until the age of ten, Vishniac was homeschooled; from ten to seventeen, he )Tj
T*(attended a private school at which he earned a gold medal for scholarship.[7] )Tj
T*(Beginning in 1914, he spent six years at Shanyavsky Institute \(now University\) )Tj
T*(in Moscow. While enrolled there, he served in the Tsarist, Kerensky and Soviet )Tj
T*(armies. At the Institute, he studied zoology and became an assistant professor )Tj
T*(of biology.[6] As a graduate student, he worked with prestigious biologist )Tj
T*(Nikolai Koltzoff, experimenting with inducing metamorphosis in axolotl, a )Tj
T*(species of aquatic salamander. While his experiments were a success, Vishniac )Tj
T*(was not able to publish a paper detailing his findings due to the chaos in )Tj
T*(Russia and his results were eventually independently duplicated. In spite of )Tj
T*(this, he went on to take a three-year course in medicine.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Berlin )Tj
T*( In 1918, Vishniac's immediate family moved to Berlin because of anti-Semitism )Tj
T*(spurred by uprisings against the Bolsheviks. Roman followed them and, shortly )Tj
T*(after arriving, married Luta \(Leah\) Bagg, who gave birth to two children, Mara )Tj
T*(and Wolf.[8] Roman Vishniac supported his own budding family \(and sometimes his )Tj
T*(parents as well\) by working at various jobs. In his free time, he studied Far )Tj
T*(Eastern Art at the University of Berlin. Vishniac researched endocrinology and )Tj
T*(optics, and did some photography \(see right\). In Berlin, he also initiated his )Tj
T*(public speaking career by joining the Salamander Club, at which he often gave )Tj
T*(lectures on naturalism.[3] )Tj
T*( In 1935, as anti-Semitism was growing in Germany, Vishniac was commissioned by )Tj
T*(the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\(JDC\) in Central Europe to )Tj
T*(photograph Jewish communities in Eastern Europe as part of a fund-raising drive )Tj

T*(to help support these poor communities.[9] Vishniac developed and printed these )Tj
T*(pictures in his dark room in his Berlin apartment. Further trips to Eastern )Tj
T*(Europe were undertaken between 1935 and 1938, again at the behest of the )Tj
T*(JDC.[2] Vishniac used both a Leica and a Rolleiflex camera in his photography. )Tj
T*(In 1939, his wife and children moved to Sweden to stay with Luta's parents, )Tj
T*(away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in Nice that summer.[3] )Tj
T*( Vishniac returned to Paris in late summer 1940, and was arrested by Marshal )Tj
T*(P√©tain's police and interned at Camp du Ruchard, a deportation camp in )Tj
T*(Indre-et-Loire. This occurred because Latvia, of which he was a citizen, had )Tj
T*(been subsumed into the Soviet Union and Vishniac was considered a "stateless )Tj
T*(person". After three months, as a result of his wife's efforts and aid from the )Tj
T*(American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, he obtained a visa that allowed )Tj
T*(him to escape via Lisbon to the U.S. with his family. His father stayed behind )Tj
T*(and spent the war hidden in France; his mother died from cancer in 1941 while )Tj
T*(still in Nice.[3][5][10] )Tj
T*( [edit] New York )Tj
T*( The Vishniac family fled from Lisbon to New York City in 1940,[4] arriving on )Tj
T*(New Year's Eve. Vishniac tried to get a job but failed: "For me, it was a time )Tj
T*(of distraction and fear."[3] He was multilingual, speaking at least German, )Tj
T*(Russian and Yiddish, but he could not yet speak any English and thus had a )Tj
T*(difficult time.[11] He managed to do some portraiture work with mostly foreign )Tj
T*(clients; but business was poor. It was during this time, in 1942, that he took )Tj
T*(one of his most celebrated portraits, that of Albert Einstein. He arrived at )Tj
T*(Einstein's home in Princeton, New Jersey, getting into the scientist's study )Tj
T*(with the ruse of bringing regards from mutual friends in Europe, and )Tj
T*(photographed him while the scientist was not paying attention to him, occupied )Tj
T*(in thought. Einstein later called this portrait his favourite. )Tj
T*( In 1946, Vishniac divorced Luta, and the next year he married Edith Ernst, an )Tj
T*(old family friend. A few years later, he gave up portraiture and went on to do )Tj
T*(freelance work in the field of photomicroscopy.[3] )Tj
T*( Once in the United States, Vishniac tried desperately to earn sympathy for )Tj
T*(impoverished Jews in Eastern Europe. When his work was exhibited at Teachers )Tj
T*(College, Columbia University in 1943,[12] he wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt \(First )Tj
T*(Lady at the time\), asking her to visit the exhibit, but she did not. He also )Tj
T*(sent some of his photographs to the President, for which he was politely )Tj
T*(thanked.[13][14] )Tj
T*( Of the 16,000 taken in Eastern Europe by Vishniac, only 2,000 photographs )Tj
T*(reached America.[14][15] Most of these negatives were carefully hidden by )Tj
T*(Vishniac and his family; others were smuggled in by Vishniac's good friend )Tj
T*(Walter Bierer through Cuba.[13] In the photographer's own words, )Tj
T*(‚Äú)Tj
T*(I sewed some of the negatives into my clothing when I came to the United States )Tj
T*(in 1940. Most of them were left with my father in Clermont-Ferrand, a small )Tj
T*(city in central France. He survived there, hidden. He concealed the negatives )Tj
T*(under floorboards and behind picture frames.[15])Tj
T*(‚Äù)Tj
T*( [edit] Later life )Tj
T*( Even when he grew older, Vishniac was very active. In 1957, he was appointed )Tj
T*(research associate at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and in 1961 was )Tj
T*(promoted to "professor of biological education".[16] In his seventies and )Tj
T*(eighties, Vishniac became "Chevron Professor of Creativity" at Pratt Institute )Tj
T*(\(where he taught courses on topics such as the philosophy of photography[11]\). )Tj
T*(During this time he lived on the West Side of Manhattan with his wife Edith, )Tj
T*(teaching, photographing, reading and collecting artifacts.[17] Some items that )Tj
T*(were in his collection include a 14th-century Buddha, Chinese tapestries, )Tj
T*(Japanese swords, various antique microscopes, valued old maps and venerable )Tj
T*(books.[18] He taught Oriental and Russian art, general philosophy and religion )Tj
T*(in science, specifically Jewish topics, ecology, numismatics, photography and )Tj
T*(general science at City University of New York, Case Western Reserve )Tj
T*(University[16] and at various other institutions.[3] )Tj

T*( During his life, Vishniac was the subject and creator of many films and )Tj
T*(documentaries; the most celebrated of which was the Living Biology series. This )Tj
T*(consisted of seven films on cell biology; organs and systems; embryology; )Tj
T*(evolution; genetics; ecology; botany; the animal world; and the microbial )Tj
T*(world. It was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.[7] )Tj
T*( Vishniac received Honorary Doctoral degrees from the Rhode Island School of )Tj
T*(Design, Columbia College of Art and the California College of Art,[19] before )Tj
T*(his death from colon cancer on January 22, 1990.[20]  )Tj
T*( [edit] Photography )Tj
T*( [edit] In Central and Eastern Europe )Tj
T*( [edit] 1935‚Äì1939 )Tj
T*( Vishniac is best known for his dramatic photographs of poor and pious Jews in )Tj
T*(cities and shtetlach of Eastern Europe.[2] He was commissioned to take these )Tj
T*(pictures by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee \(JDC\) as part of a )Tj
T*(fundraising initiative, but Vishniac had a personal interest in this subject )Tj
T*(matter. He traveled back and forth from Berlin to the ghettos of Russia, )Tj
T*(Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Lithuania between 1935 and 1938 as well as )Tj
T*(working for the Committee.[4][21] )Tj
T*( While touring Europe, Vishniac posed as a traveling fabric salesman, seeking )Tj
T*(aid where he could and bribing anyone who got in his way.[22] During his )Tj
T*(touring of Eastern Europe \(1935‚Äì1939\), he was often arrested by police for )Tj
T*(taking these pictures, sometimes because he was thought to be spying[15] Later, )Tj
T*(when published, these photographs made him popular enough for his work to be )Tj
T*(showcased as one-man shows at Columbia University, the Jewish Museum \(New )Tj
T*(York\), International Center of Photography and other such institutions. )Tj
T*( Vishniac claimed that he had taken 16,000 photos in this period, every one a )Tj
T*(candid shot,[11] but the veracity of these claims has been challenged by )Tj
T*(research by Maya Benton, a curator at the International Center of )Tj
T*(Photography.[2][23] In order to photograph small villages in these mountains, )Tj
T*(Vishniac claimed he carried heavy equipment \(Leica, Rolleiflex, movie camera, )Tj
T*(tripods\), 115¬†pounds \(52 kilograms\) by his estimate, on his back, up steep )Tj
T*(roads, trekking many miles.[13][17][3] Vishniac captured thousands of )Tj
T*(impoverished Jews on film, "[...] to preserve ‚Äî in pictures, at least ‚Äî a world )Tj
T*(that might soon cease to exist".[24] )Tj
T*( When using a Leica for indoor shots, Vishniac sometimes brought a kerosene )Tj
T*(lamp \(visible in some of his work\) if there was insufficient light, keeping his )Tj
T*(back to a wall for support, and holding his breath.[11] The Rolleiflex was used )Tj
T*(mostly for outdoor scenes. )Tj
T*( Roman Vishniac did not just want to preserve the memories of the Jews; he )Tj
T*(actively fought to increase awareness in the West of the worsening situation in )Tj
T*(Eastern Europe. "Through his photographs, he sought to alert the rest of the )Tj
T*(world to the horrors [of the Nazi persecution]", Mitgang.[17] In late 1938, for )Tj
T*(example, he sneaked into Zbaszyn, an internment camp in Germany near the )Tj
T*(border, where Jews awaited deportment to Poland. After photographing the )Tj

T*(the faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient casement )Tj
T*(windows and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street )Tj
T*(corners."[27]Gene Thornton, writer for The New York Times, called them "[...] )Tj
T*(somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter".[28] )Tj
T*( These pictures, all in black and white, were done with available light or )Tj
T*(sometimes a lantern,[11] yet they are "amazingly crisp with surprising depth of )Tj
T*(field".[29] Indeed, "There is a grainy realism to Vishniac's photographic )Tj
T*(style. We can almost finger the coarse textures of coats and shawls; the layers )Tj
T*(of fabric worn by the people seem more related to tree bark than to the )Tj
T*(well-pressed wool suit worn by an occasional elegant passerby."[27] Vishniac is )Tj
T*(known to have exaggerated in composing the captions of his photographs, and in )Tj
T*(some cases he may have fabricated the stories behind them.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Impact )Tj
T*( Vishniac's photographs from this period are widely commended and on permanent )Tj
T*(display in many museums. Edward Steichen places his pre-Holocaust photographs, )Tj
T*("among photography's finest documents of a time and place."'[22] However, there )Tj
T*(has been criticism of Vishniac's work, focusing on the lack of diversity of his )Tj
T*(subjects in his work from Eastern Europe and quality of his composition. It has )Tj
T*(been argued that he should have also photographed wealthier Jews, in addition )Tj
T*(to the poor Jews in ghettos. Thornton criticized his photographs for their )Tj
T*(unprofessional qualities, citing "errors of focus and accidents of design, as )Tj
T*(when an unexplained third leg and foot protrudes from the long coat of a )Tj
T*(hurrying scholar."[28] )Tj
T*( Vishniac's photographs have had a profound effect on Holocaust literature and )Tj
T*(have illustrated many books about the Jewish ghettos and Holocaust. In the case )Tj
T*(of The Only Flowers of her Youth, the drama of the photograph inspired Miriam )Tj
T*(Nerlove to write a novel based on the story of the girl in the picture.[30] )Tj
T*( For this work, Roman Vishniac has received the Memorial Award of the American )Tj
T*(Society of Magazine Photographers in 1956. He was also the winner of the visual )Tj
T*(arts category of awards of the Jewish Book Council in 1984; The Only Flowers of )Tj
T*(her Youth was deemed "most impressive" at the International Photographic )Tj
T*(Exhibition in Lucerne in 1952; and the Grand Prize for Art in Photography, New )Tj
T*(York Coliseum.[3][6] )Tj
T*( When photographic curator Maya Benton began to catalog Vishniac's negatives )Tj
T*(for the archive of the International Center of Photography, she noticed that, )Tj
T*(in his book A Vanished World, Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and )Tj
T*(wrote captions that were not supported by the material. In the final spread of )Tj
T*(the book, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the )Tj
T*(opposite page a small boy points with his finger to his eye. Vishiniac's )Tj
T*(caption reads: "The father is hiding from the Endecy \(members of the National )Tj
T*(Democratic Party\). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, )Tj
T*(1938." At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: "The )Tj
T*(pogromshchiki" \(pogrom lynch mob\) "are coming. But the iron door was no )Tj
T*(protection." Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls )Tj
T*(of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book "almost )Tj
T*(certainly did not happen".[2] In addition, Michael di Capua, who edited )Tj
T*(Vishniac's text for A Vanished World, has said that he felt disquiet while )Tj
T*(compiling the text, since so much information was unsubstantiated.[2] Benton )Tj
T*(also suggested that the terms of Vishniac's commission from the JDC‚Äîto )Tj
T*(photograph "not the fullness of Eastern European Jewish life but its most )Tj
T*(needy, vulnerable corners for a fund-raising project"‚Äîhad led to his )Tj
T*(over-emphasizing poor, religious communities in A Vanished World.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Photomicroscopy and biology )Tj
T*( In addition to the candid photography for which he is best known, Vishniac )Tj
T*(worked heavily in the field of photomicroscopy, \(specifically interference )Tj
T*(microscopy and cinemicroscopy\). He specialized in photographing living insects )Tj
T*(and had a talent for arranging the moving specimens in "just the right poses", )Tj
T*(according to Philippe Halsman, former president of the American Society of )Tj
T*(Magazine Photographers. On the subject of Vishniac's skill in photomicroscopy, )Tj
T*(Halsman said he was, "a special kind of genius".[3] He worked with all sorts of )Tj

T*(specimens, from protozoa, to fireflies to amino acids. Vishniac's work in )Tj
T*(photomicroscopy was, and is, highly regarded in the field. For three )Tj
T*(consecutive years, beginning in 1952, he won the Best-of-the-Show Award of the )Tj
T*(Biological Photographic Association in New York.[3] )Tj
T*( One of Roman Vishniac's most famous endeavors in the field of photomicroscopy )Tj
T*(was his revolutionary photographs from the inside of a firefly's eye, behind )Tj
T*(4,600 tiny ommatidia, complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images )Tj
T*(taken at the medical school of Boston University of the circulating blood )Tj
T*(inside a hamster's cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for )Tj
T*(light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy.[16] His method of )Tj
T*(colorization, \(developed in the 1960s and early 1970s\) uses polarized light to )Tj
T*(penetrate certain formations of cell structure and may greatly improve the )Tj
T*(detail of an image.[3] )Tj
T*( In the field of biology, Vishniac specialized in marine microbiology, the )Tj
T*(physiology of ciliates, circulatory systems in unicellular plants and )Tj
T*(endocrinology \(from his work in Berlin\) and metamorphosis.[16] Despite his )Tj
T*(aptitude and accomplishments in the field, most of his work in biology was )Tj
T*(secondary to his photography: Vishniac studied the anatomy of an organism )Tj
T*(primarily to better photograph it. Besides experimenting with the metamorphosis )Tj
T*(of axolotl, he also researched the morphology of chromosomes in 1920: both in )Tj
T*(Berlin. As a biologist and philosopher in 1950, he hypothesized polyphyletic )Tj
T*(origin, a theory that life arose from multiple, independent biochemical )Tj
T*(reactions, spawning multicellular life. As a philosopher, he "developed )Tj
T*(principles of rationalistic philosophy" in the '50s.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Other photography )Tj
T*( Vishniac is notable for his photographs of insects mating, sea bass feasting )Tj
T*(and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, he )Tj
T*(would stalk insects or other such creatures for hours in the suburbs around New )Tj
T*(York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie for over an hour in the )Tj
T*(grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less )Tj
T*(artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently )Tj
T*(frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an extension tube. He had even )Tj
T*(trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take )Tj
T*(his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.[3] )Tj
T*( Vishniac's subjects varied throughout his life. At times, he would focus on )Tj
T*(documenting everyday life, as in Berlin, and later portraiture, doing famous )Tj
T*(portraits of Albert Einstein and Marc Chagall. He was also a pioneer in )Tj
T*(time-lapse photography, on which he worked from 1915 to 1918,[3][7] and again )Tj
T*(later in life. )Tj
T*( [edit] Religion and philosophy )Tj
T*( Roman Vishniac always had strong ties with his ancestry, especially the Jewish )Tj
T*(aspect of it, "From earliest childhood, my main interest was my ancestors". He )Tj
T*(was a Zionist[11][17] and a strong sympathizer with Jews who had suffered )Tj
T*(because of anti-Semitism, "Oh yes, I could be a professor of anti-Semitism", )Tj
T*(also stating then that he had one hundred and one relatives who died during the )Tj
T*(Holocaust. A famous photo of his \(pictured right\) of a store in Berlin selling )Tj
T*(devices for separating Jews and non-Jews by skull shape was used by him to )Tj
T*(criticize the pseudoscience of German anti-Semites.[17] )Tj
T*( Vishniac associated much of his work with religion, though not specifically )Tj
T*(Judaism. "Nature, God, or whatever you want to call the creator of the Universe )Tj
T*(comes through the microscope clearly and strongly," he remarked in his )Tj
T*(laboratory one day. )Tj
T*( Living with the memory of hardship, Vishniac was, "an absolute optimist filled )Tj
T*(with tragedy. His humanism is not just for Jews, but for every living )Tj
T*(thing."[22] He probably believed in God or some similar concept, but he was )Tj
T*(non-denominational and did not adhere strictly to the principles of any )Tj
T*(religion. He even clashed with Orthodox Jews in one well-known instance: The )Tj
T*(religious Jews he met on his trek around Europe would not let themselves be )Tj
T*(photographed, quoting the Bible and its prohibition of making of graven images. )Tj
T*(Vishniac's famous response was, "the Torah existed for thousands of years )Tj

T*( Starship Troopers is a military science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein, )Tj
T*(first published \(in abridged form\) as a serial in The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; )Tj
T*(Science Fiction \(October, November 1959, as "Starship Soldier"\) and published )Tj
T*(hardcover in December 1959. )Tj
T*( The first-person narrative is about a young soldier from the Philippines named )Tj
T*(Juan "Johnnie" Rico and his exploits in the Mobile Infantry, a futuristic )Tj
T*(military service branch equipped with powered armor. Rico's military career )Tj
T*(progresses from recruit to non-commissioned officer and finally to officer )Tj
T*(against the backdrop of an interstellar war between mankind and an arachnoid )Tj
T*(species known as "the Bugs". Rico and the other characters discuss moral and )Tj
T*(philosophical aspects of suffrage, civic virtue, juvenile delinquency, capital )Tj
T*(punishment, and war.[3] )Tj
T*( Starship Troopers won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960.[4] The novel has )Tj
T*(attracted controversy and criticism for its social and political themes )Tj
T*(including allegations of advocating fascism or militarism.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Heinlein's military background and political views )Tj
T*( Heinlein graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, and served on active )Tj
T*(duty in the U.S. Navy for five years. He served on the then new aircraft )Tj
T*(carrier USS Lexington in 1931, and as a naval lieutenant aboard the destroyer )Tj
T*(USS Roper between 1933 and 1934, until he was forced to leave the Navy because )Tj
T*(of pulmonary tuberculosis. Heinlein never served in active combat while a Navy )Tj
T*(officer and he was a civilian during World War II doing research and )Tj
T*(development at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.[6] Heinlein's non-combat Naval )Tj
T*(service would become a point of contention in later criticism of Starship )Tj
T*(Troopers. )Tj
T*( According to Heinlein, his desire to write Starship Troopers was sparked by )Tj
T*(the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the National Committee )Tj
T*(for a Sane Nuclear Policy on April 5, 1958 calling for a unilateral suspension )Tj
T*(of nuclear weapon testing by the United States. In response, Robert and )Tj
T*(Virginia Heinlein created the small "Patrick Henry League" in an attempt to )Tj
T*(create support for the U.S. nuclear testing program. Heinlein found himself )Tj
T*(under attack both from within and outside the science fiction community for his )Tj
T*(views. The novel may, perhaps, be viewed as Heinlein clarifying and defending )Tj
T*(his military and political views of the time.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Writing of the novel )Tj
T*( Some time during 1958 and 1959, Heinlein ceased work on the novel that would )Tj
T*(become Stranger in a Strange Land and wrote Starship Troopers. It was first )Tj

T*(published in The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction in October and )Tj
T*(November 1959 as a serial called Starship Soldier. Although originally written )Tj
T*(as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner, it was rejected,[8] )Tj
T*(prompting Heinlein to cease writing juvenile fiction for Scribners, to end his )Tj
T*(association with them completely, and begin writing books with more adult )Tj
T*(themes.[9] The novel was eventually published as teenage fiction by G. P. )Tj
T*(Putnam's Sons.[10] )Tj
T*( Starship Troopers takes place in the midst of an interstellar war between the )Tj
T*(Terran Federation of Earth and the Arachnids \(referred to as "The Bugs"\) of )Tj
T*(Klendathu. It is narrated as a series of flashbacks by Juan Rico, and is one of )Tj
T*(only a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion.[11] The novel opens with )Tj
T*(Rico aboard the corvette Rodger Young \(named after Medal of Honor winner Rodger )Tj
T*(Wilton Young\), serving with the platoon known as "Rasczak's Roughnecks" \(named )Tj
T*(after the platoon leader, Lt. Rasczak\) about to embark on a raid against the )Tj
T*(planet of the "Skinnies", who are allies of the Arachnids. We learn that he is )Tj
T*(a cap\(sule\) trooper in the Terran Federation's Mobile Infantry. The raid )Tj
T*(itself, one of the few instances of actual combat in the novel, is relatively )Tj
T*(brief: the Roughnecks land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, )Tj
T*(suffering a single casualty in the process \(Dizzy Flores, who dies in the )Tj
T*(retrieval boat of wounds received in action\). )Tj
T*( The story then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school, and his )Tj
T*(decision to sign up for Federal Service over the objections of his father, who )Tj
T*(disowns him. This is the only chapter that describes Rico's civilian life, and )Tj
T*(most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lt. Col. Jean V. )Tj
T*(Dubois, Rico's school instructor in "History and Moral Philosophy"; and Fleet )Tj
T*(Sergeant Ho, a recruiter for the armed forces of the Terran Federation. )Tj
T*( Some see Dubois as speaking for Heinlein throughout the novel; he delivers )Tj
T*(what is probably the book's most famous soliloquy on violence: "[It] has )Tj
T*(settled more issues in history than has any other factor."[12] Fleet Sergeant )Tj
T*(Ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military )Tj
T*(tirades seem primarily to be a contrast with Dubois. We learn, later, that his )Tj
T*(rants are part of a policy intended to scare off applicants signing up without )Tj
T*(conviction. )Tj
T*( Interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico's high school )Tj
T*(History and Moral Philosophy course, which describe how in the Terran )Tj
T*(Federation of Rico's day, the rights of a full Citizen \(to vote, and hold )Tj
T*(public office\) must be earned through some form of volunteer Federal service. )Tj
T*(Those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this Federal )Tj
T*(Service retain all other rights generally associated with a modern democracy )Tj
T*(\(free speech, assembly, etc.\), but they cannot vote or hold public office. This )Tj
T*(structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the "20th century Western )Tj
T*(democracies", brought on by both social failures at home \(among which appear to )Tj
T*(be poor handling of juvenile delinquency\) and military defeat by the Chinese )Tj
T*(Hegemony overseas.[13] )Tj
T*( In the next section of the novel, after being denied all his higher preferred )Tj
T*(Service choices, Rico goes to boot camp at Camp Arthur Currie, on the northern )Tj
T*(prairies. Five chapters are spent exploring Rico's experience there, including )Tj
T*(his adjustment to a very different situation, entering the service under the )Tj
T*(training of the leading instructor, career Ship's Sergeant Charles Zim. Camp )Tj
T*(Currie is rigorous by design; less than ten percent of the recruits finish )Tj
T*(basic training. The rest either resign, are expelled, or die in training. One )Tj
T*(of the chapters deals with Ted Hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant )Tj
T*(complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer during a )Tj
T*(simulated combat exercise \(he caught Sgt. Zim by surprise after being struck by )Tj
T*(the sergeant for failure to perform during the exercise\). Another recruit, a )Tj
T*(deserter who murdered a baby girl while AWOL, is hanged by his battalion after )Tj
T*(his arrest by civilian police and return to Camp Currie. Rico himself is )Tj
T*(flogged for poor handling of \(simulated\) nuclear weapons during a drill; )Tj
T*(despite these experiences, he eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit in )Tj
T*(the Fleet. )Tj

T*( At some point during Rico's training, the "Bug War" has changed from border )Tj
T*(incidents to a full-fledged formal war, and Rico finds himself taking part in )Tj
T*(combat operations. The war "officially" starts with an Arachnid attack that )Tj
T*(annihilates the city of Buenos Aires \(which kills Juan's mother who was )Tj
T*(visiting there\), although Rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there )Tj
T*(had been many "'incidents', 'patrols', or 'police actions'".[14] Rico briefly )Tj
T*(describes the Terran Federation's loss at the Battle of Klendathu during which )Tj
T*(his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed. Following Klendathu, the Terran )Tj
T*(Federation is reduced to making hit-and-run raids similar to the one described )Tj
T*(at the beginning of the novel \(which, chronologically, would be placed between )Tj
T*(chapters 10 and 11\). Rico meanwhile finds himself posted to Rasczak's )Tj
T*(Roughnecks. This part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military )Tj
T*(life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned )Tj
T*(officers, personified in this case by Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal. )Tj
T*( Eventually, Rico decides to become a career soldier, and one of his fellow )Tj
T*(troopers claims he is officer material and should consider volunteering for )Tj
T*(Officer Candidate School. He applies and is accepted. It turns out to be just )Tj
T*(like boot camp, only "squared and cubed with books added".[15] Rico manages to )Tj
T*(make it through to the final exam, "in the Fleet". He is commissioned a )Tj
T*(temporary Third Lieutenant for his field-test and commands his own unit during )Tj
T*(Operation Royalty. It is revealed at the end of the chapter that one of the )Tj
T*(enlisted men he leads into combat is his former basic training instructor, )Tj
T*(Sergeant Zim. Although personally convinced that he badly mismanaged his men, )Tj
T*(he passes the final exam, and graduates as a Second Lieutenant. )Tj
T*( Rico has a meeting with his father, who had volunteered for Service after his )Tj
T*(wife, Rico's mother, was killed at Buenos Aires. The final chapter serves as )Tj
T*(more of a coda, depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the lieutenant in )Tj
T*(command of Rico's Roughnecks, preparing to drop to Klendathu as part of a major )Tj
T*(strike, his father being his senior sergeant, and a Native American Third )Tj
T*(Lieutenant-in-training \(James Bearpaw, known as "Jimmie"\) of his own under )Tj
T*(instruction. )Tj
T*( [edit] Major themes )Tj
T*( [edit] Politics )Tj
T*( Starship Troopers seems to have been meant as a political essay as well as a )Tj
T*(novel. Large portions of the book take place in classrooms, with Rico and other )Tj
T*(characters engaged in debates with their History and Moral Philosophy teacher, )Tj
T*(who is often thought to be speaking in Heinlein's voice.[citation needed] The )Tj
T*(overall theme of the book is that social responsibility requires being prepared )Tj
T*(to make individual sacrifice. Heinlein's Terran Federation is a limited )Tj
T*(democracy, with aspects of a meritocracy in regard to full citizenship, based )Tj
T*(on voluntarily assuming a responsibility for the common weal. Suffrage can only )Tj
T*(be earned by those willing to serve their society by at least two years of )Tj
T*(volunteer Federal Service ‚Äì "the franchise is today limited to discharged )Tj
T*(veterans", \(ch. XII\), instead of, as Heinlein would later note, anyone "...who )Tj
T*(is 18 years old and has a body temperature near 37¬†¬∞C"[16] The Federation is )Tj
T*(required to find a place for anyone who desires to serve, regardless of his )Tj
T*(skill or aptitude \(this also includes service ranging from teaching to )Tj
T*(dangerous non-military work such as serving as experimental medical test )Tj
T*(subjects to military service -- such as Rico's Mobile Infantry\). )Tj
T*( There is an explicit contrast to the "democracies of the 20th century", which )Tj
T*(according to the novel, collapsed because "people had been led to believe that )Tj
T*(they could simply vote for whatever they wanted... and get it, without toil, )Tj
T*(without sweat, without tears."[17] Indeed, Colonel Dubois criticizes as )Tj
T*(unrealistic the famous U.S. Declaration of Independence line concerning "life, )Tj
T*(liberty and the pursuit of happiness". No one can stop anyone from pursuing )Tj
T*(happiness, but the Colonel claims life and liberty exist only if they are )Tj
T*(deliberately sought and, often, bought painfully by great effort and sacrifice. )Tj
T*( Starship Troopers is also widely-regarded as a vehicle for Heinlein's )Tj
T*(anti-communist views. Characters attack Karl Marx \(a "pompous fraud"\), the )Tj
T*(labor theory of value \("All the work one cares to add will not turn a mud pie )Tj

T*("weird in the extreme"\).[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Military history, traditions, and military science )Tj
T*( The Korean War ended only five years before Heinlein began writing Starship )Tj
T*(Troopers, and the book makes several direct references to it, such as the claim )Tj
T*(that "no 'Department of Defense' ever won a war."[20] Heinlein also refers to )Tj
T*(the American prisoners of war taken in that conflict, including the popular )Tj
T*(accusations of Communist brainwashing.[21] After the Korean War ended, there )Tj
T*(were rumors that the Chinese and North Koreans continued to hold a large number )Tj
T*(of Americans.[22] Rico's History and Moral Philosophy class at Officer )Tj
T*(Candidate School has a long discussion about whether it is moral to never leave )Tj
T*(a single man behind, even at the risk of starting a new war. Rico debates )Tj
T*(whether it was worth it to risk two nations' futures over a single fellow )Tj
T*(soldier who might not even deserve to live by some standard, but concludes it )Tj
T*("doesn't matter whether it's a thousand ‚Äì or just one, sir. You fight."[23] )Tj
T*( Several references are made to other wars: these include the name of the )Tj
T*(starship that collided with Valley Forge; Ypres, a major battleground in World )Tj
T*(War I; the starship Mannerheim, a reference to the World War II-era marshal of )Tj
T*(Finland; and Rico's boot camp, Camp Arthur Currie \(named after Sir Arthur )Tj
T*(Currie who commanded the Canadian Corps during WWI\). A brief reference is also )Tj
T*(made to Camp Sergeant Smokey Smith, named after a Canadian recipient of the )Tj
T*(Victoria Cross in World War II. The airport was the location of the U.S. Army )Tj
T*(Air Corps' Walla Walla Army Air Base in World War II. The 91st Bomb Group lays )Tj
T*(claim to being the first Army Air Forces outfit to use that base. Another World )Tj
T*(War I reference was the phrase "Come on, you apes! You wanna live forever?", )Tj
T*(which comes from Gunnery Sergeant Dan Daly at the Battle of Belleau Wood )Tj
T*(\(although instead of "apes", Daly said "sons of bitches"\). This phrase, )Tj
T*(however, has been attributed to various people throughout military history, )Tj
T*(including perhaps the earliest documented citation by Frederick II of Prussia )Tj
T*(when he was meant to have said "Kerls, wollt ihr ewig leben?" \(tr. "Men, would )Tj
T*(you live forever?"\) at the Battle of Kol√≠n. The starship corvette Rodger Young )Tj
T*(was named after the World War II Medal of Honor recipient, and lines from the )Tj
T*(chorus of Frank Loesser's Ballad of Rodger Young are used as the ship's recall )Tj
T*(signal. Another war reference, this one from the War of 1812, involves some )Tj
T*(implications of the court-martial of Third Lieutenant William Sitgreaves Cox, )Tj
T*(which are discussed in some detail. )Tj
T*( [edit] Military innovations )Tj
T*( In addition to Heinlein's political views, Starship Troopers popularized a )Tj
T*(number of military concepts and innovations, some of which have inspired real )Tj
T*(life research. The novel's most noted innovation is the powered armor )Tj
T*(exoskeletons used by the Mobile Infantry.[24] These suits were controlled by )Tj
T*(the wearer's own movements, but powerfully augmented a soldier's strength, )Tj
T*(speed, weight carrying capacity \(which allowed much heavier personal armament\), )Tj
T*(jumping ability \(including jet and rocket boost assistance\), and provided the )Tj
T*(wearer with improved senses \(infrared vision and night vision, radar, and )Tj
T*(amplified hearing\), a completely self-contained personal environment including )Tj
T*(a drug-dispensing apparatus, sophisticated communications equipment, and )Tj
T*(tactical map displays. Their powered armor made the Mobile Infantry a hybrid )Tj
T*(between an infantry unit and an armored one. )Tj
T*( Another concept the book pioneered was that of "space-borne infantry". The )Tj
T*(heavily mechanized units of M.I. troops were attached to interstellar troop )Tj
T*(transport spacecraft, which then delivered them to planetary target zones, by )Tj
T*(dropping groups of Mobile Infantrymen onto the planet surface from orbit via )Tj
T*(individual re-entry capsules \(hence the book's slang term "cap troopers" for )Tj
T*(M.I. troops\). The uses for such a force‚Äîranging from smash-and-burn raids, to )Tj
T*(surgical strikes, conventional infantry warfare, and holding beachheads‚Äîand the )Tj
T*(tactics that might be employed by such soldiers are described extensively )Tj
T*(within the novel. The tactics, training, and many other aspects of this )Tj
T*(futuristic elite force are carefully detailed: everything from the function of )Tj
T*(the armored suits themselves, to the need for multiple variants of powered )Tj

T*(unit tactics that would be needed, to the operational use of the suits in )Tj
T*(combat. )Tj
T*( [edit] Influence with U.S. military )Tj
T*( While powered armor is Starship Troopers' most famous legacy, its influence )Tj
T*(extends deep into contemporary militaries. Over half a century after its )Tj
T*(publication, Starship Troopers is on the reading lists of the United States )Tj
T*(Marine Corps[25][26][27] and the United States Navy.[28] It is the first )Tj
T*(science fiction novel on the reading lists at three of the five United States )Tj
T*(military branches. When Heinlein wrote Starship Troopers the United States )Tj
T*(military was a largely conscripted force, with conscripts serving two-year )Tj
T*(hitches. Today the U.S. military has incorporated many ideas similar to )Tj
T*(Heinlein's concept of an all-volunteer, high-tech strike force. In addition, )Tj
T*(references to the book keep appearing in military culture. In 2002 a marine )Tj
T*(general described the future of Marine Corps clothing and equipment as needing )Tj
T*(to emulate the Mobile Infantry.[29] In 2012, an article on the US military )Tj
T*(buying ballistic face masks specifically referenced the "big steel gorilla[s]" )Tj
T*(of Starship Troopers.[30] )Tj
T*( [edit] Controversy )Tj
T*( To Heinlein's surprise,[31]Starship Troopers won the Hugo Award for Best Novel )Tj
T*(in 1960.[4] By 1980, twenty years after its release, it had been translated )Tj
T*(into eleven languages and was still selling strongly. However, Heinlein )Tj
T*(complained that, despite this success, almost all the mail he received about it )Tj
T*(was negative and he only heard about it "when someone wants to chew me )Tj
T*(out."[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Literary critiques )Tj
T*( The main literary criticism against Starship Troopers is that it is nothing )Tj
T*(more than a vehicle for Heinlein's political views. John Brunner compared it to )Tj
T*(a "Victorian children's book"[33] while Anthony Boucher, founder of The )Tj
T*(Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, remarked that Heinlein had )Tj
T*("forgotten to insert a story."[33]Alexei Panshin complained that the novel was )Tj
T*(overly simplistic‚Äî"[an] account of the making of a [Marine] ... and nothing )Tj
T*(more"[34]‚Äîand that the characters were simply mouthpieces for Heinlein: "At the )Tj
T*(end you know nothing of [Rico's] tastes, his likes and dislikes, his personal )Tj
T*(life. The course of the book changes him in no way because there is nothing to )Tj
T*(change ‚Äì Rico remains first and last a voice reading lines about how nice it is )Tj
T*(to be a soldier.... The other characters are even more sketchy, or are simple )Tj
T*(expositions of an attitude."[34] Richard Geib adds "The real life 'warriors' I )Tj
T*(have known are all more multi-faceted than anyone we meet in Starship Troopers. )Tj
T*(And the ones I know who have killed are much more ambivalent about having done )Tj
T*(so."[35] He further complained about the almost complete lack of sexuality )Tj
T*(among the characters and the absence of any serious romance.[35] )Tj
T*( In his review column for F&amp;SF, Damon Knight selected the novel as one of )Tj
T*(the 10 best genre books of 1959.[36] )Tj
T*( In a 2009 retrospective, Jo Walton finds Starship Troopers "military SF done )Tj
T*(extremely well."[37] "Heinlein was absolutely at his peak when he wrote this in )Tj
T*(1959. He had so much technical stylistic mastery of the craft of writing )Tj
T*(science fiction that he could do something like this [per Walton, he tells the )Tj
T*(story "backwards and in high heels"] and get away with it." "It‚Äôs astonishing )Tj
T*(that [Starship Troopers is] still controversial now, fifty years after it was )Tj
T*(first published," and "Probably [Heinlein would] have been delighted at how )Tj
T*(much the book has made people think and argue."[37] )Tj
T*( [edit] Allegations of militarism )Tj
T*( Another complaint about Starship Troopers is that it is either militaristic or )Tj
T*(pro-military. There was a two-year debate in the Proceedings of the Institute )Tj
T*(for Twenty-First Century Studies \(PITFCS\) that was sparked by a comparison )Tj
T*(between a quote in Starship Troopers that "the noblest fate that a man can )Tj
T*(endure is to place his own mortal body between his loved home and war's )Tj
T*(desolation"[38] \(paraphrase of the fourth stanza of "The Star-Spangled Banner"\) )Tj
T*(and the anti-war poem "Dulce et Decorum Est" by Wilfred Owen.[33]Dean )Tj

T*(McLaughlin called it "a book-length recruiting poster."[33]Alexei Panshin, a )Tj
T*(veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the )Tj
T*(reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict )Tj
T*(existed simply because, "Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on )Tj
T*(their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything )Tj
T*(else to do."[34]Joe Haldeman, a Vietnam veteran and author of the anti-war )Tj
T*(Hugo[39]- and Nebula[40]-winning science fiction novel The Forever War, )Tj
T*(similarly complained that Starship Troopers unnecessarily glorifies war.[41] )Tj
T*( Defending Heinlein, George Price argued that "[Heinlein] implies, first, that )Tj
T*(war is something 'endured,' not enjoyed, and second, that war is so unpleasant, )Tj
T*(so desolate, that it must at all costs be kept away from one's home."[33] In a )Tj
T*(commentary on his essay "Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?", Heinlein agreed )Tj
T*(that Starship Troopers "glorifies the military ... Specifically the P.B.I., the )Tj
T*(Poor Bloody Infantry, the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved )Tj
T*(home and the war's desolation ‚Äì but is rarely appreciated... he has the )Tj
T*(toughest job of all and should be honored."[42] The book's dedication also )Tj
T*(reads in part "... to all sergeants everywhere who have labored to make men out )Tj
T*(of boys."[43] Heinlein also received some complaints about the lack of )Tj
T*(conscription in Starship Troopers \(the military draft was the law in the United )Tj
T*(States when he wrote the novel\).[44] )Tj
T*( [edit] Allegations of fascism )Tj
T*( Another accusation is that the Terran Federation is a fascist society, and )Tj
T*(that Starship Troopers is therefore an endorsement of fascism. These )Tj
T*(allegations have become so popular that Sircar's Corollary of Godwin's Law )Tj
T*(states that once Heinlein is brought up during online debates, "Nazis or Hitler )Tj
T*(are mentioned within three days."[45] The most visible proponent of these views )Tj
T*(is probably Paul Verhoeven, whose film version of Starship Troopers portrayed )Tj
T*(the Terran Federation's personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of )Tj
T*(those worn by the Third Reich-era Wehrmacht; but Verhoeven admits that he never )Tj
T*(finished reading the actual book.[46] Most of the arguments for this view cite )Tj
T*(the idea that only veterans can vote and non-veterans lack full citizenship; )Tj
T*(moreover, only veterans are permitted to teach the course "History &amp; Moral )Tj
T*(Philosophy", children are taught that moral arguments for the status quo are )Tj
T*(mathematically correct, and both capital and corporal punishment are accepted )Tj
T*(as methods of teaching morality and reducing crime. Federal Service is not )Tj
T*(necessarily military, although it is suggested that hardship and strict )Tj
T*(discipline are pervasive. According to Poul Anderson, Heinlein got the idea not )Tj
T*(from Nazi Germany or Sparta, but from Switzerland.[13] )Tj
T*( Defenders of the book usually point out that although the electoral franchise )Tj
T*(is limited, the government of the Terran Federation is democratically elected. )Tj

T*(military in nature, or not necessary to a businessman during peacetime. Some )Tj
T*(Federal Service recruiters wear military ribbons, and a term of service "is )Tj
T*(either real military service... or a most unreasonable facsimile thereof." )Tj
T*(Moreover, the history of Federal Service describes it as being started by )Tj
T*(military veterans who did not originally allow civilians to join and are not )Tj
T*(described as allowing them to join later. Gifford decides, as a result, that )Tj
T*(although Heinlein's intentions may have been that Federal Service be 95% )Tj
T*(non-military, in relation to the actual contents of the book, Heinlein "is )Tj
T*(wrong on this point. Flatly so." )Tj
T*( [edit] Allegations of utopianism )Tj
T*( More recently, the book has been analyzed as a utopia \(in the sense of a )Tj
T*(society that does not, and cannot, exist\), and that while Heinlein's ideas )Tj
T*(sound plausible, they have never been put to the test. This criticism has been )Tj
T*(leveled by writers such as Robert A. W. Lowndes, Philip Jos√© Farmer, and )Tj
T*(Michael Moorcock. The latter wrote an essay entitled "Starship Stormtroopers" )Tj
T*(in which he attacked Heinlein and other writers over similar "Utopian )Tj
T*(fiction."[49] Lowndes accused Heinlein of using straw man arguments, )Tj
T*("countering ingenuous half-truths with brilliant half-truths."[33] Lowndes )Tj
T*(further argued that the Terran Federation could never be as idealistic as )Tj
T*(Heinlein portrays it to be because he never properly addressed "whether or not )Tj
T*([non-citizens] have at least as full a measure of civil redress against )Tj
T*(official injustice as we have today".[33] Farmer also agreed, arguing that a )Tj
T*("world ruled by veterans would be as mismanaged, graft-ridden, and insane as )Tj
T*(one ruled by men who had never gotten near the odor of blood and guts."[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Allegations of racism )Tj
T*( The supposedly racist aspects of Starship Troopers involve the Terrans' )Tj
T*(relations with the Bugs and the Skinnies. Richard Geib has suggested that )Tj
T*(Heinlein portrayed the individual Arachnids as lacking "minds or souls... )Tj
T*(killing them seems no different from stepping on ants."[35] Both Robert )Tj
T*(Peterson and John Brunner believe that the nicknames "Bugs" and "Skinnies" )Tj
T*(carry racial overtones, Brunner using the analogy of the Korean word for person )Tj
T*("gook"[33] while Peterson suggested that "not only does the nickname 'Bugs' for )Tj
T*(the arachnids of Klendathu sound too much like a racial slur ‚Äì think of the )Tj
T*(derogatory use of the word 'Jew' ‚Äì but Heinlein's characters unswervingly )Tj
T*(believe that humans are superior to Bugs, and that humans are destined to )Tj
T*(spread across the galaxy."[50] )Tj
T*( Robert A. W. Lowndes argues that the war between the Terrans and the Arachnids )Tj
T*(is not about a quest for racial purity, but rather an extension of Heinlein's )Tj
T*(belief that man is a wild animal. According to this theory, if man lacks a )Tj
T*(moral compass beyond the will to survive, and he was confronted by another )Tj
T*(species with a similar lack of morality, then the only possible moral result )Tj
T*(would be warfare.[33] )Tj
T*( [edit] Adaptations )Tj
T*( In 1976, Avalon Hill published Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, a )Tj
T*(map-and-counter board wargame featuring a number of scenarios as written in the )Tj
T*(novel.[51] )Tj
T*( In 1997, as a tie-in with Verhoeven's film adaptation, Avalon later published )Tj
T*(Starship Troopers: Prepare For Battle!, which entirely focused on the film.[52] )Tj
T*( In 2005, Mongoose Publishing published Starship Troopers: The Miniatures Game, )Tj
T*(a miniature wargame which used material from both the novel and the film.[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] Computer )Tj
T*( In 1982, Radio Shack/Tandy Corporation published Klendathu by Leo )Tj
T*(Christopherson for the TRS-80 Model I/II/III and Color Computer.[54] )Tj
T*( In 1998, Mythic Entertainment[55] released Starship Troopers: Battlespace )Tj

T*( In 1988, from October to December, Sunrise and Bandai Visual produced a )Tj
T*(6-episode Japanese original video animation locally titled Uch≈´ no Senshi with )Tj
T*(mobile infantry power armor designs by Kazutaka Miyatake \(famous for his work )Tj
T*(on Macross/Robotech\). )Tj
T*( In August 1999, an animated series, Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles, )Tj
T*(which took inspiration from both the novel and the first \(1997\) film, lasted 40 )Tj
T*(episodes until April 2000. )Tj
T*( In July 2012, an animated movie entitled Starship Troopers: Invasion \(2012\) )Tj
T*(was released on DVD and Blu-ray. It features new characters, with Rico, now a )Tj
T*(General, playing a supporting role. )Tj
T*( The film rights to the novel were licensed in the 1990s.[57] The first film, )Tj
T*(also titled Starship Troopers, was directed by Paul Verhoeven \(RoboCop, Total )Tj
T*(Recall\) and released in 1997. The film diverged greatly in terms of the themes )Tj
T*(and plot of the novel, and received mixed reviews from critics.[58] Two sequels )Tj
T*(followed: Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation \(2004\), and Starship )Tj
T*(Troopers 3: Marauder \(2008\). )Tj
T*( In December 2011, Neal H. Moritz, producer of films such as The Fast and the )Tj
T*(Furious series and I Am Legend, announced plans to do a remake of the film that )Tj
T*(promises to be more faithful to the source material.[59] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cultural influence )Tj
T*( Starship Troopers influenced many later science fiction stories, setting a )Tj
T*(tone for the military in space, a type of story referred to as military science )Tj
T*(fiction. John Steakley's novel Armor was, according to the author, born out of )Tj
T*(frustration with the small amount of actual combat in Starship Troopers and )Tj
T*(because he wanted this aspect developed further.[60] Conversely, Joe Haldeman's )Tj
T*(anti-war novel The Forever War is popularly thought to be a direct reply to )Tj
T*(Starship Troopers, and though Haldeman has stated that it is actually a result )Tj
T*(of his personal experiences in the Vietnam War, he has admitted to being )Tj
T*(influenced by Starship Troopers.[41] Haldeman's historical novel 1968 has a )Tj
T*(soldier going crazy in Vietnam: he imagines himself killing alien bugs in a )Tj
T*(battlesuit, instead of actual Vietnamese people.[37] )Tj
T*( Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is also thought by many to have been either a )Tj
T*(direct response to or influenced by Starship Troopers. Card has flatly denied )Tj
T*(this, saying that he never read the novel and did not read The Forever War )Tj
T*(until after writing Ender's Game.[61]Harry Harrison wrote a satirical book )Tj
T*(called Bill, the Galactic Hero which he described as "a piss-take on Heinlein's )Tj
T*(Starship Troopers."[62]John Scalzi's novel Old Man's War is, according to the )Tj
T*(author, explicitly patterned after Starship Troopers.[63] In recent years, John )Tj
T*(Ringo's series Legacy of the Aldenata \(also known as the Posleen series\) )Tj
T*(featured a more explicit homage to Heinlein's book. In 1987, a Choose Your Own )Tj

T*(Starship Troopers as part of their preparation prior to filming.[64] )Tj

T*( Katharine Houghton Hepburn \(May 12, 1907 ‚Äì June 29, 2003\) was an American )Tj
T*(actress of film, stage, and television. Known for her headstrong independence )Tj
T*(and spirited personality, Hepburn's career as a Hollywood leading lady spanned )Tj
T*(more than 60 years. Her work came in a range of genres, from screwball comedy )Tj
T*(to literary drama, and she received four Academy Awards for Best Actress‚Äîa )Tj
T*(record for any performer. Hepburn's characters were often strong, sophisticated )Tj
T*(women with a hidden vulnerability. )Tj
T*( Raised in Connecticut by wealthy, progressive parents, Hepburn began to act )Tj
T*(while studying at Bryn Mawr College. After four years in the theatre, favorable )Tj
T*(reviews of her work on Broadway brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her )Tj
T*(early years in the film industry were marked with success, including an Academy )Tj
T*(Award for her third picture, Morning Glory \(1933\), but this was followed by a )Tj
T*(series of commercial failures. In 1938 she was labeled "box office poison". )Tj
T*(Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out her contract with RKO Radio )Tj
T*(Pictures and acquiring the film rights to The Philadelphia Story, which she )Tj
T*(sold on the condition that she be the star. In the 1940s she was contracted to )Tj
T*(Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where her career focused on an alliance with Spencer )Tj
T*(Tracy. The screen-partnership spanned 25 years, and produced nine movies. )Tj
T*( Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she regularly )Tj
T*(appeared in Shakespeare stage productions and tackled a range of literary )Tj
T*(roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African )Tj
T*(Queen \(1951\), a persona the public embraced. Three more Oscars came for her )Tj
T*(work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner \(1967\), The Lion in Winter \(1968\), and On )Tj
T*(Golden Pond \(1981\). In the 1970s she began appearing in television movies, )Tj
T*(which became the focus of her career in later life. She remained active into )Tj
T*(old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. After a )Tj
T*(period of inactivity and ill-health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96. )Tj
T*( Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to )Tj
T*(conform to societal expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, )Tj
T*(athletic, and wore trousers before it was fashionable for women to do so. She )Tj
T*(married once, as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. A 26-year )Tj
T*(affair with her co-star Spencer Tracy was hidden from the public. With her )Tj
T*(unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the )Tj
T*(screen, Hepburn came to epitomize the "modern woman" in 20th-century America )Tj
T*(and helped change perceptions of women. In 1999, she was named by the American )Tj
T*(Film Institute as the top female Hollywood legend.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Hepburn was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on May 12, 1907, the second of six )Tj
T*(children. Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn \(1879‚Äì1962\), a urologist at )Tj
T*(Hartford Hospital, and Katharine Martha Houghton \(1878‚Äì1951\), a feminist )Tj
T*(campaigner. Both fought for social change in America: Thomas Hepburn helped )Tj
T*(establish the New England Social Hygiene Association, which educated the public )Tj
T*(about venereal disease,[2] while Katharine Martha headed the Connecticut Woman )Tj
T*(Suffrage Association and later campaigned for birth control with Margaret )Tj
T*(Sanger.[3] As a child, Hepburn joined her mother on several "Votes For Women" )Tj
T*(demonstrations.[4] The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of )Tj

T*(speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished.[5] Her )Tj
T*(parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views, which )Tj
T*(stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered.[6][7] Hepburn )Tj
T*(said she realized from a young age that she was the product of "two very )Tj
T*(remarkable parents",[8] and credited her "enormously lucky" upbringing with )Tj
T*(providing the foundation for her success.[9][10] She remained close to her )Tj
T*(family throughout her life.[11] )Tj
T*( The young Hepburn was a tomboy who liked to call herself Jimmy and cut her )Tj
T*(hair short like a boy's.[12] Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use )Tj
T*(their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, )Tj
T*(wrestle, and play golf and tennis.[13] Golf became a passion for his oldest )Tj
T*(daughter: she took daily lessons and became very good, reaching the semi-final )Tj
T*(of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship.[14] She loved swimming in )Tj
T*(Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that )Tj
T*("the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you."[15] Hepburn was a fan )Tj
T*(of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night.[16] With )Tj
T*(her friends and siblings, she would put on plays and perform to her neighbors )Tj
T*(for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the Navajo people.[17] )Tj
T*( On April 3, 1921, while visiting friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn )Tj
T*(discovered the body of her older brother Tom, whom she adored,[18] dead from an )Tj
T*(apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself.[19] The )Tj
T*(Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death must have )Tj
T*(been an experiment that had gone wrong.[20] The incident made the teenage )Tj
T*(Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people.[21] She shied away from other )Tj
T*(children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private )Tj
T*(tutoring.[22] For many years, she used Tom's birthday \(November 8\) as her own. )Tj
T*(It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn )Tj
T*(revealed her true birth date.[23] )Tj
T*( In 1924, Hepburn gained a place at Bryn Mawr College. She attended the )Tj
T*(institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and )Tj
T*(recalled disliking the experience.[24] It was the first time she had been in )Tj
T*(school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her )Tj
T*(classmates.[25] She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and )Tj
T*(was once suspended for smoking in her room.[26] Hepburn was drawn to acting but )Tj
T*(roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had )Tj
T*(improved, she began performing regularly.[26] The lead role in a production of )Tj
T*(The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it )Tj
T*(received, cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career.[14] She )Tj
T*(graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career )Tj
T*( [edit] Breaking into theatre \(1928‚Äì1932\) )Tj
T*( Hepburn left Bryn Mawr determined to become an actress.[28] The day after )Tj
T*(graduating,[29] she traveled to Baltimore to meet Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a )Tj
T*(successful stock theatre company. Impressed by her eagerness, Knopf cast )Tj
T*(Hepburn in his current production, The Czarina.[30] She received good reviews )Tj
T*(for her small role; the Printed Word described her performance as )Tj
T*("arresting".[31] She was given a part in the following week's show, but here )Tj
T*(Hepburn was less accomplished. She was criticized for her shrill voice, and so )Tj
T*(left Baltimore to study with an acclaimed voice tutor in New York City.[32] )Tj
T*( Knopf decided to produce The Big Pond in New York and called for Hepburn to be )Tj
T*(the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired )Tj
T*(and replaced with Hepburn, which gave her a starring role after only four weeks )Tj
T*(in the theatre.[33] On opening night, Hepburn turned up late, mixed her lines, )Tj
T*(tripped over her feet, and spoke too high and fast to be comprehensible.[32] )Tj
T*(She was promptly fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, )Tj
T*(Hepburn joined forces with producer Arthur Hopkins, and accepted the role of a )Tj
T*(schoolgirl in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the )Tj
T*(Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight )Tj
T*(nights.[32] Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip )Tj

T*(marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, her beau from college. She planned to leave the )Tj
T*(theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy )Tj
T*(role in Holiday, which she held for six months.[34] )Tj
T*( In 1929, Hepburn turned down a role with the Theatre Guild to play the lead in )Tj
T*(Death Takes a Holiday. She felt the role was perfect,[35] but again she was )Tj
T*(fired.[36] Hepburn went back to the Guild and took an understudy role for )Tj
T*(minimum pay in A Month in the Country. In the spring of 1930, Hepburn joined a )Tj
T*(stock company in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. She left halfway through the )Tj
T*(summer season, and continued studying with a drama tutor.[37] In early 1931, )Tj
T*(she was cast in the Broadway production of Art and Mrs. Bottle. She was )Tj
T*(released from the role after the playwright took a dislike to her, saying "She )Tj
T*(looks a fright, her manner is objectionable, and she has no talent", but then )Tj
T*(rehired when no other actress could be found.[38] It went on to be a small )Tj
T*(success.[39] )Tj
T*( Hepburn appeared in a number of plays with a summer stock company in Ivoryton, )Tj
T*(Connecticut, and she proved to be a hit.[38] During the summer of 1931, Philip )Tj
T*(Barry asked her to appear in his new play, The Animal Kingdom, alongside Leslie )Tj
T*(Howard. They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure this was the )Tj
T*(role to make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was )Tj
T*(fired.[40] When she asked Barry why she had been let go, he responded, "Well, )Tj
T*(to be brutally frank, you weren't very good."[40] This unsettled the )Tj
T*(self-assured Hepburn, but she continued to look for work.[41] She took a small )Tj
T*(role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began she received an offer to read )Tj
T*(for the lead role in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband.[42] )Tj
T*( The Warrior's Husband proved to be Hepburn's break-out performance. Biographer )Tj
T*(Charles Higham states that the play was ideal for the actress, requiring an )Tj
T*(aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself )Tj
T*(with its production.[43] It opened on March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on )Tj
T*(Broadway. Hepburn's first entrance called for her to leap down a narrow )Tj
T*(stairway with a stag over her shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic. The show )Tj
T*(ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews.[44] Richard )Tj
T*(Garland of the New York World-Telegram wrote, "It's been many a night since so )Tj
T*(glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene."[45] )Tj
T*( [edit] Hollywood success \(1932‚Äì1934\) )Tj
T*( A scout for the Hollywood agent Leland Hayward spotted Hepburn's appearance in )Tj
T*(The Warrior's Husband, and asked her to test for the part of Sydney Fairfield )Tj
T*(in the upcoming RKO film A Bill of Divorcement. Hepburn was unhappy with her )Tj
T*(test scene, and sent material from Holiday instead.[46] Director George Cukor )Tj
T*(was impressed by what he saw: "There was this odd creature," he recalled, "she )Tj
T*(was unlike anybody I'd ever heard." He particularly liked the manner in which )Tj
T*(she picked up a glass: "I thought she was very talented in that action."[47] )Tj
T*(Offered the role, Hepburn demanded $1,500 a week, a large amount for an unknown )Tj
T*(actress.[48] Cukor encouraged the studio to accept her demands[28] and they )Tj
T*(signed Hepburn to a temporary contract with a three-week guarantee.[49] RKO )Tj
T*(head David O. Selznick recounted that he took a "tremendous chance" in casting )Tj
T*(the unusual actress.[50] )Tj
T*( Hepburn arrived in California in July 1932, at 25 years old. She starred in A )Tj
T*(Bill of Divorcement opposite John Barrymore, showing no sign of )Tj
T*(intimidation.[50][51] Although she struggled to adapt to the nature of film )Tj
T*(acting, Hepburn was fascinated by the industry from the start.[52] The picture )Tj
T*(was a success and Hepburn received rave reviews.[53]Mordaunt Hall of The New )Tj
T*(York Times called her performance "exceptionally fine ... Miss Hepburn's )Tj
T*(characterization is one of the finest seen on the screen".[54] The Variety )Tj
T*(review declared, "Standout here is the smash impression made by Katharine )Tj
T*(Hepburn in her first picture assignment. She has a vital something that sets )Tj
T*(her apart from the picture galaxy."[55] On the strength of A Bill of )Tj
T*(Divorcement, RKO signed the actress to a long-term contract.[56] George Cukor )Tj
T*(became a lifetime friend and colleague‚Äîhe and Hepburn made ten films )Tj
T*(together.[57] )Tj

T*(and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, )Tj
T*(but Hepburn's own reviews were good.[58] Regina Crewe wrote in the Journal )Tj
T*(American that although her mannerisms were grating, "they compel attention, and )Tj
T*(they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive )Tj
T*(personality."[59] Her third picture confirmed Hepburn as a major actress in )Tj
T*(Hollywood.[60] For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace in Morning Glory, she )Tj
T*(won an Academy Award for Best Actress. She had seen the script on the desk of )Tj
T*(producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, )Tj
T*(insisted that the role be hers.[61] Hepburn chose not to attend the awards )Tj
T*(ceremony‚Äîas she would not for the duration of her career‚Äîbut was thrilled with )Tj
T*(the win.[62] Her success continued with the role of Jo in the screen adaptation )Tj
T*(of Little Women \(1933\). The movie was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest )Tj
T*(successes to date,[50] and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice )Tj
T*(Film Festival. Little Women was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was )Tj
T*(proud of her performance, later saying, "I defy anyone to be as good as I was )Tj
T*([as Jo]".[60] )Tj
T*( By the end of 1933 Hepburn was at the top of her profession, but yearned to )Tj
T*(prove herself on Broadway.[63]Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre )Tj
T*(producers of the 1920s, was going through a career slump.[64] He asked Hepburn )Tj
T*(to appear in the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary.[65] )Tj
T*(Before she was given leave, RKO asked that she film Spitfire \(1934\). Hepburn's )Tj
T*(role in the movie was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl. It is widely )Tj
T*(considered one of her worst films, and Hepburn received poor reviews for the )Tj
T*(effort.[66] Hepburn kept a picture of Hicks in her bedroom throughout her life )Tj
T*(to "[keep] me humble."[67] )Tj
T*( The Lake previewed in Washington, D.C., where there was a large advance )Tj
T*(sale.[65] Harris's poor direction had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she )Tj
T*(struggled with the performance.[68] Despite this, Harris moved the play to New )Tj
T*(York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on )Tj
T*(December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics.[69]Dorothy )Tj
T*(Parker quipped, "Katharine Hepburn runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."[28] )Tj
T*(Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of )Tj
T*(rapidly declining box office sales.[70] Harris decided to take the show to )Tj
T*(Chicago, saying to Hepburn, "My dear, the only interest I have in you is the )Tj
T*(money I can make out of you." Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close )Tj
T*(the production instead.[71] She later referred to Harris as "hands-down the )Tj
T*(most diabolical person I have ever met",[64] and claimed this experience was )Tj
T*(important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.[72] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career struggles, "box office poison" \(1934‚Äì1938\) )Tj
T*( After the failure of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little )Tj
T*(Minister \(1934\), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, in an attempt to )Tj
T*(repeat the success of Little Women.[73] There was no such recurrence, and the )Tj
T*(picture was a commercial failure.[74] The romantic drama Break of Hearts \(1935\) )Tj
T*(with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money at the box )Tj
T*(office.[75] After three forgettable movies, success returned to Hepburn with )Tj
T*(Alice Adams \(1935\), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social )Tj
T*(ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role.[76] )Tj
T*(The picture was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the )Tj
T*(actress her second Oscar nomination.[77] )Tj
T*( Berman allowed Hepburn to select her next feature.[77] She chose George )Tj
T*(Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett \(1935\), which paired her for the first )Tj
T*(time with Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her character )Tj
T*(masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and )Tj
T*(it was unpopular with the public.[78] For her next film she played Mary Stuart )Tj
T*(in John Ford's Mary of Scotland \(1936\). It met with a similarly poor )Tj
T*(reception.[79]A Woman Rebels \(1937\) followed, a Victorian era drama where )Tj

T*(snapped back, "Yes I have five: two white and three colored."[83] She would not )Tj
T*(give interviews and denied requests for autographs,[84] which earned her the )Tj
T*(nickname "Katharine of Arrogance".[85] The public were also baffled by her )Tj
T*(boyish behavior and fashion choices, and she became a largely unpopular )Tj
T*(figure.[82][86] Hepburn sensed that she needed to leave Hollywood,[87] so )Tj
T*(returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. It had a )Tj
T*(successful tour,[88] but uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk )Tj
T*(failure after the disaster of The Lake, Hepburn decided against taking the show )Tj
T*(to Broadway.[87] Towards the end of 1936, Hepburn vied for the role of Scarlett )Tj
T*(O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.[89] Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer )Tj
T*(her the part because he felt she had no sex appeal. He reportedly told Hepburn, )Tj
T*("I can't see Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years."[90] )Tj
T*( For her next feature, Stage Door \(1937\) paired Hepburn with Ginger Rogers in a )Tj
T*(role that mirrored her own life‚Äîthat of a wealthy society girl trying to make )Tj
T*(it as an actress.[92] Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which )Tj
T*(gave her top billing over Rogers,[93] and the film was nominated for Best )Tj
T*(Picture at the Academy Awards. But it was not the box office hit RKO had )Tj
T*(hoped.[92] Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio )Tj
T*(continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity.[94] She was cast in )Tj
T*(Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby \(1938\) alongside Cary Grant. )Tj
T*(Hepburn played the physical comedy of the film with confidence,[94] and took )Tj
T*(tips on comedic timing from her co-star Walter Catlett.[95]Bringing Up Baby was )Tj
T*(acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box )Tj
T*(office.[96] With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, )Tj
T*(biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of )Tj
T*(Hepburn.[97] )Tj
T*( Bringing Up Baby was the last picture Hepburn did at RKO. After its release, )Tj
T*(the Independent Theatre Owners of America included Hepburn on a list of actors )Tj
T*(considered "Box Office Poison".[97] The next film RKO offered her was Mother )Tj
T*(Carey's Chickens, a B movie with poor prospects.[97] Hepburn turned it down, )Tj
T*(and instead opted to buy herself out of her contract for $75,000.[98] Many )Tj
T*(actors were afraid to leave the stability of the studio system at the time, but )Tj
T*(Hepburn's personal wealth meant she could afford to be independent.[99] She )Tj
T*(signed on for the film version of Holiday \(1938\) with Columbia Pictures, )Tj
T*(pairing her for the third time with Grant. The comedy was well received by )Tj
T*(critics, but it failed to draw much of an audience,[100] and the next script )Tj
T*(offered to Hepburn came with a salary of $10,000‚Äîless than she had received at )Tj
T*(the start of her film career.[101] Reflecting on this change in fortunes, )Tj
T*(Andrew Britton writes of Hepburn, "No other star has emerged with greater )Tj
T*(rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so )Tj
T*(unpopular so quickly for so long a time."[102] )Tj
T*( [edit] Revival \(1939‚Äì1942\) )Tj
T*( Following this decline in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own )Tj
T*(comeback vehicle. She left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on )Tj
T*(to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to )Tj
T*(showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating )Tj
T*(a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability.[103]Howard )Tj
T*(Hughes, Hepburn's beau at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket )Tj
T*(back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted )Tj
T*(on stage.[104] The pair also contributed a quarter of the play's production )Tj

T*(Tracy, were both unavailable. Louis B. Mayer promised her James Stewart and )Tj
T*($150,000 "for anyone else you want or can get."[109] Hepburn chose her friend )Tj
T*(and previous co-star, Cary Grant, to whom she ceded top billing.[110] Before )Tj
T*(filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, "I don't want to make a grand entrance )Tj
T*(in this picture. Moviegoers¬†... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot of )Tj
T*(people want to see me fall flat on my face." Thus the film began with Grant )Tj
T*(knocking the actress flat on her backside.[111] Berg describes how the )Tj
T*(character was crafted to have audiences "laugh at her enough that they would )Tj
T*(ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in )Tj
T*("re-creating" her public image.[112]The Philadelphia Story was one of the )Tj
T*(biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall.[28] The review )Tj
T*(in Time declared, "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven."[113] Herb Golden of )Tj
T*(Variety stated, "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture¬†... The perfect conception of )Tj

T*(third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle )Tj
T*(Award for Best Actress.[115][116] )Tj
T*( Hepburn was also responsible for the development of her next project, the )Tj
T*(romantic comedy Woman of the Year. The idea for the film was proposed to her by )Tj
T*(Garson Kanin in 1941. Hepburn passed the outline onto Joseph L. Mankiewicz at )Tj
T*(MGM, who expressed an interest in the picture. Kanin recalled how Hepburn )Tj
T*(contributed to the script: reading it, suggesting cuts and word changes, and )Tj
T*(generally providing helpful enthusiasm for the project.[117] Hepburn presented )Tj
T*(the finished product to MGM and demanded $250,000‚Äîhalf for her, half for the )Tj
T*(authors, Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner, Jr.[118] Her terms accepted, Hepburn )Tj
T*(was also given the director and co-star of her choice, George Stevens and )Tj
T*(Spencer Tracy. Released in 1942, Woman of the Year was another success. Critics )Tj
T*(praised the chemistry between the stars and, says Higham, noted Hepburn's )Tj
T*("increasing maturity and polish".[119] The World-Telegram commended two )Tj
T*("brilliant performances",[120] and Hepburn received a fourth Academy Award )Tj
T*(nomination for her role as independent career-woman Tess Harding. During the )Tj
T*(course of the movie, Hepburn signed a star contract with MGM.[110] )Tj
T*( [edit] Slowing in the 1940s \(1942‚Äì1949\) )Tj
T*( In 1942, Hepburn returned to Broadway to appear in another Philip Barry play, )Tj
T*(Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind.[120] Critics )Tj
T*(were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a )Tj
T*(high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks.[121] MGM were eager to reunite Tracy and )Tj
T*(Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper of the Flame \(1942\). A dark )Tj
T*(mystery with a propaganda message on the dangers of fascism, the film was seen )Tj
T*(by Hepburn as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement.[122] It )Tj
T*(received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of )Tj
T*(the Tracy‚ÄìHepburn pairing.[123] )Tj
T*( Since Woman of the Year Hepburn had committed to a romantic relationship with )Tj
T*(Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism )Tj
T*(and insomnia.[125] Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less for the )Tj
T*(remainder of the decade than she had done in the 1930s‚Äînotably by not appearing )Tj
T*(on-stage again until 1950.[126] Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the )Tj
T*(morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself. She took an )Tj
T*(atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama )Tj
T*(Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid )Tj
T*(response and she was described as miscast.[127] She then reunited with Tracy )Tj
T*(for the film version of Without Love \(1945\), after which she turned down a role )Tj
T*(in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to )Tj

T*(Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm response from )Tj
T*(critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and )Tj
T*(abroad.[131] The same year, Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in Song of )Tj
T*(Love. She trained intensively with a pianist for the role.[132] By the time of )Tj
T*(its release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her )Tj
T*(public opposition to the growing anti-communist witch-hunt in Hollywood. Viewed )Tj
T*(by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months )Tj
T*(and people reportedly threw things at screenings of Song of Love.[133] Her next )Tj
T*(film role came unexpectedly, as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only )Tj
T*(days before shooting began on Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union )Tj
T*(\(1948\).[134] Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn )Tj
T*(was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy‚ÄìHepburn )Tj
T*(picture.[133] Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at )Tj
T*(the box office.[135] )Tj
T*( Tracy and Hepburn appeared on screen together for a third consecutive year in )Tj
T*(the 1949 film Adam's Rib. Like Woman of the Year, it was a "battle of the )Tj
T*(sexes" comedy, and was written specifically for the duo by their friends Garson )Tj
T*(Kanin and Ruth Gordon. A story of married lawyers who oppose each other in )Tj
T*(court, Hepburn described it as "perfect for [Tracy] and me".[136] She was )Tj
T*(instrumental in getting Judy Holliday cast in the film, which kick-started the )Tj
T*(young actress's Hollywood career.[137] Although Hepburn's political views still )Tj
T*(prompted scattered picketing at theatres around the country, Adam's Rib was a )Tj
T*(hit, favorably reviewed and the most profitable Tracy‚ÄìHepburn picture to )Tj
T*(date.[138]The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther was full of praise for the )Tj
T*(film and hailed the duo's "perfect compatibility".[139] )Tj
T*( [edit] Professional expansion \(1950‚Äì1952\) )Tj
T*( The 1950s saw Hepburn take on a series of professional challenges, and stretch )Tj
T*(herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most )Tj
T*(actresses began to retreat.[140] Berg describes the decade as "the heart of her )Tj
T*(vast legacy" and "the period in which she truly came into her own."[141] In )Tj
T*(January 1950, Hepburn made her first venture into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind )Tj
T*(in As You Like It. She hoped to prove she could play already established )Tj
T*(material,[29] and said, "It's better to try something difficult and flop than )Tj
T*(to play it safe all the time."[142] It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York )Tj
T*(to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows.[143] The )Tj
T*(production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as )Tj
T*(the only leading lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material on )Tj
T*(the stage.[144] )Tj
T*( In 1951, Hepburn filmed The African Queen, her first movie in Technicolor. She )Tj
T*(played Rose Sayer, a prim spinster missionary living in German East Africa at )Tj
T*(the outbreak of World War I. Co-starring Humphrey Bogart, The African Queen was )Tj
T*(shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn )Tj
T*(embraced.[145] It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became )Tj
T*(ill with dysentery during filming.[146] Later in life, she released a memoir )Tj
T*(about the experience. The movie was released at the end of 1951 to popular )Tj
T*(support and critical acclaim,[147] and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress )Tj
T*(nomination at the Academy Awards. The first successful film she had made )Tj
T*(without Tracy since The Philadelphia Story a decade earlier, it proved that she )Tj
T*(could be a hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.[148] )Tj
T*( Hepburn went on to make the sports comedy Pat and Mike \(1952\), the second film )Tj
T*(written specifically as a Tracy‚ÄìHepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. Hepburn )Tj
T*(was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the )Tj
T*(film: "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... it occurred to me that her )Tj
T*(audience was missing a treat."[149] Hepburn was asked to gain weight for the )Tj
T*(role, and she was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, )Tj
T*(many of which did not end up in the film.[150]Pat and Mike was one of the )Tj
T*(team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's )Tj

T*( In the summer of 1952, Hepburn appeared in London's West End for a ten-week )Tj
T*(run of George Bernard Shaw's The Millionairess. Her parents had read Shaw to )Tj
T*(her when she was a child, which made the play a special experience for the )Tj
T*(actress.[153] Two years of intense work had left her exhausted, however, and )Tj
T*(her friend Constance Collier wrote that Hepburn was "on the verge of a nervous )Tj
T*(breakdown".[154] Widely acclaimed, The Millionairess was brought to )Tj
T*(Broadway.[155] In October 1952 it opened at the Shubert Theatre, where despite )Tj
T*(a lukewarm critical response it sold out its ten-week run.[154] Hepburn )Tj
T*(subsequently tried to get the play adapted into a film: a script was written by )Tj
T*(Preston Sturges, and Hepburn offered to work for nothing and pay the director )Tj
T*(herself, but no studio picked up the project.[156] She later referred to this )Tj
T*(as the biggest disappointment of her career.[153] )Tj
T*( [edit] Spinsters and Shakespeare \(1953‚Äì1962\) )Tj
T*( Pat and Mike was the last film Hepburn completed on her MGM contract, making )Tj
T*(her free to select her own projects.[155] She spent two years resting and )Tj
T*(traveling, before committing to David Lean's romantic drama Summertime \(1955\). )Tj
T*(The movie was filmed in Venice, with Hepburn playing a lonely spinster who has )Tj
T*(a passionate love affair. She described it as "a very emotional part" and found )Tj
T*(it fascinating to work with Lean.[157] At her own insistence, Hepburn performed )Tj
T*(a fall into a canal and developed a chronic eye infection as a result.[158] The )Tj
T*(role earned her another Academy Award nomination and has been cited as some of )Tj
T*(her finest work.[159][160] Lean later said it was his personal favorite of the )Tj
T*(films he made, and Hepburn his favorite actress.[161] The following year, )Tj
T*(Hepburn spent six months touring Australia with the Old Vic theatre company, )Tj
T*(playing Portia in The Merchant of Venice, Kate in The Taming of the Shrew, and )Tj
T*(Isabella in Measure for Measure. The tour was successful and Hepburn earned )Tj
T*(significant plaudits for the effort.[162] )Tj
T*( Hepburn received an Academy Award nomination for the second year running for )Tj
T*(her work opposite Burt Lancaster in The Rainmaker \(1956\). Again she played a )Tj
T*(lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it seemed that Hepburn had found a )Tj
T*(niche in playing "love-starved spinsters" that critics, audiences, and her )Tj
T*(peers clearly enjoyed.[163] Hepburn said of playing such roles, "With Lizzie )Tj
T*(Curry [The Rainmaker] and Jane Hudson [Summertime] and Rosie Sayer [The African )Tj
T*(Queen]‚ÄîI was playing me. It wasn't difficult for me to play those women, )Tj
T*(because I'm the maiden aunt."[163] Less success that year came from The Iron )Tj
T*(Petticoat \(1956\), a reworking of the classic comedy Ninotchka, with Bob Hope. )Tj
T*(Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, a performance Bosley Crowther )Tj
T*(called "horrible".[164] It was a critical and commercial failure,[164] and )Tj
T*(Hepburn considered it the worst film on her resume.[163] )Tj
T*( Tracy and Hepburn reunited on screen for the first time in five years for the )Tj
T*(office-based comedy Desk Set \(1957\). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of )Tj
T*(their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's spinster persona,[165] )Tj
T*(but it performed poorly at the box office.[166] That summer Hepburn returned to )Tj
T*(Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare )Tj
T*(Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice )Tj
T*(in Much Ado About Nothing. The shows were positively received.[165] After two )Tj
T*(years away from the screen, she starred in a film adaptation of Tennessee )Tj
T*(Williams' controversial play Suddenly, Last Summer \(1959\) with Elizabeth Taylor )Tj
T*(and Montgomery Clift. The movie was shot in London, and was "a completely )Tj
T*(miserable experience" for Hepburn.[167] She clashed with director Joseph L. )Tj
T*(Mankiewicz during filming, which culminated with her spitting at him in )Tj
T*(disgust.[168] The picture was a financial success,[169] and her work as creepy )Tj

T*(throughout.[185] John Russell Taylor of The Times suggested that Eleanor was )Tj
T*("the performance of her ... career", and proved that she was "a growing, )Tj
T*(developing, still surprising actress".[186] The movie was nominated in all the )Tj
T*(major categories at the Academy Awards, and for the second year running Hepburn )Tj
T*(won the Oscar for Best Actress.[187] The role, combined with her performance in )Tj
T*(Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, also won Hepburn a British Academy Film Award )Tj
T*(\(BAFTA\) for Best Actress. Hepburn's next appearance was in The Madwoman of )Tj
T*(Chaillot \(1969\), which she filmed in Nice immediately after completing The Lion )Tj
T*(in Winter.[188] The picture was a failure critically and financially, and )Tj
T*(reviews targeted Hepburn for giving a misguided performance.[189] )Tj
T*( From December 1969 to August 1970, Hepburn starred in the Broadway musical )Tj
T*(Coco, about the life of Coco Chanel. Hepburn admitted that before the show, she )Tj

T*(but found the offer irresistible and, as Berg puts it, "what she lacked in )Tj
T*(euphony she made up for in guts".[191] The actress took vocal lessons six times )Tj

T*(Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable )Tj
T*(reviews.[198] She then ventured into television for the first time, in a )Tj
T*(production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie. Hepburn had been wary of )Tj
T*(the medium but it proved to be one of the main television events of 1973, )Tj
T*(scoring high in the Nielsen ratings.[199] Hepburn received an Emmy Award )Tj
T*(nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened )Tj
T*(her mind to future work on the small screen.[200] Her next project was the )Tj
T*(television movie Love Among the Ruins \(1975\), a London-based Edwardian drama )Tj
T*(with her friend Laurence Olivier. It received positive reviews and high )Tj
T*(ratings, and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.[201] )Tj
T*( Hepburn made her only appearance at the Academy Awards in 1974, to present the )Tj
T*(Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Lawrence Weingarten. She received a )Tj
T*(standing ovation, and joked with the audience, "I'm very happy I didn't hear )Tj
T*(anyone call out 'It's about time'."[202] The following year, she was paired )Tj
T*(with John Wayne in the Western Rooster Cogburn, a sequel to his Oscar-winning )Tj
T*(film True Grit. Echoing her African Queen character Rose Sayer, Hepburn again )Tj
T*(played a deeply religious spinster who teams up with a masculine loner to )Tj
T*(avenge a family member's death.[198] The movie received mediocre reviews. Its )Tj
T*(casting was enough to draw some people to the box office, but it did not meet )Tj
T*(studio expectations and was only moderately successful.[203] )Tj
T*( In 1976, Hepburn returned to Broadway for a three-month run of A Matter of )Tj
T*(Gravity. The role of eccentric Mrs. Basil was deemed a perfect showcase for the )Tj
T*(actress,[204] and the play was popular despite poor reviews.[205] It later went )Tj
T*(on a successful nationwide tour.[206] During its Los Angeles run, Hepburn )Tj
T*(fractured her hip. She chose to continue the tour performing in a )Tj
T*(wheelchair.[207] That year, she was voted "Favorite Motion Picture Actress" by )Tj
T*(the People's Choice Awards.[208] After three years away from the screen, )Tj
T*(Hepburn starred in the 1978 film Olly Olly Oxen Free. The adventure comedy was )Tj
T*(one of the biggest failures of her career‚Äîthe screenwriter James Prideaux, who )Tj
T*(worked with Hepburn, later wrote that it "died at the moment of release" and )Tj
T*(referred to it as her "lost film".[209] Hepburn claimed the main reason she had )Tj
T*(done the film was the opportunity to ride in a hot air balloon.[210] The )Tj
T*(television movie The Corn Is Green \(1979\), which was filmed in Wales, followed. )Tj
T*(It was the last of ten films Hepburn made with George Cukor, and gained her a )Tj
T*(third Emmy nomination.[211] )Tj
T*( By the 1980s Hepburn had developed a noticeable tremor, giving her a )Tj
T*(permanently shaking head. She did not work for two years, saying in a )Tj
T*(television interview, "I've had my day‚Äîlet the kids scramble and sweat it )Tj
T*(out."[212] During this period she saw the Broadway production of On Golden )Tj
T*(Pond, and was impressed by its depiction of an elderly married couple coping )Tj
T*(with the difficulties of old age.[213]Jane Fonda had purchased the screen )Tj
T*(rights for her father, actor Henry Fonda, and Hepburn sought to play opposite )Tj
T*(him in the role of quirky Ethel Thayer.[214]On Golden Pond was a success, the )Tj
T*(second-highest grossing film of 1981.[215] It demonstrated how energetic the )Tj
T*(74-year-old Hepburn was, as she dived fully clothed into Squam Lake and gave a )Tj
T*(lively singing performance.[213] The movie won her a second BAFTA and a record )Tj
T*(fourth Academy Award. Homer Dickens, in his book on Hepburn, notes that it was )Tj
T*(widely considered a sentimental win, "a tribute to her enduring career."[216] )Tj
T*( Hepburn also returned to the stage in 1981. She received a second Tony )Tj
T*(nomination for her portrayal in The West Side Waltz of a septuagenarian widow )Tj
T*(with a zest for life. Variety observed that the role was "an obvious and )Tj

T*( [edit] Focus on television \(1984‚Äì1994\) )Tj
T*( In 1984, Hepburn starred in the dark comedy Grace Quigley, the story of an )Tj
T*(elderly woman who enlists a hitman \(Nick Nolte\) to kill her. Hepburn found )Tj
T*(humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were negative and the box office was )Tj
T*(poor.[222] In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and )Tj
T*(career of Spencer Tracy.[223] The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point )Tj
T*(were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her )Tj
T*(earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences.[224] With each )Tj
T*(release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she )Tj
T*(continued to take on new roles.[225] She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's )Tj
T*(Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy )Tj
T*(Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed Hepburn to act with her grandniece, )Tj
T*(Schuyler Grant. In 1991 she released her autobiography, Me: Stories of my Life. )Tj
T*(It topped best-seller lists for over a year.[226] She returned to television )Tj
T*(screens in 1992 for The Man Upstairs, co-starring Ryan O'Neal, for which she )Tj
T*(received a Golden Globe nomination. In 1994 she worked opposite Anthony Quinn )Tj
T*(in This Can't Be Love, which was largely based on Hepburn's own life, with )Tj
T*(numerous references to her personality and career. These later roles have been )Tj
T*(described as "a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn )Tj

T*( Hepburn's final appearance in a theatrically released film, and her first )Tj
T*(since Grace Quigley ten years earlier, was Love Affair \(1994\). At 86 years old, )Tj

T*(the only film of Hepburn's career, other than the cameo appearance in Stage )Tj
T*(Door Canteen, in which she did not play a leading role.[227]Roger Ebert noted )Tj
T*(that it was the first time Hepburn had looked frail, but that the "magnificent )Tj

T*(Times made similar observations as they reflected on the actress's final )Tj
T*(big-screen appearance, stating that "if she moved more slowly than before, in )Tj

T*(fame, and confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her )Tj
T*(completely.[235] The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a )Tj
T*(two-hour long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became )Tj
T*(increasingly open with the public.[236] )Tj
T*( Hepburn's relentless energy and enthusiasm for life is often cited in )Tj
T*(biographies,[237] while a headstrong independence became key to her celebrity )Tj
T*(status.[82][218][238] This self-assuredness meant she could be controlling and )Tj
T*(difficult; her friend Garson Kanin likened her to a schoolmistress,[239] and )Tj
T*(she was famously blunt and outspoken.[232] Katharine Houghton commented that )Tj
T*(her aunt could be "maddeningly self-righteous and bossy".[240] Hepburn )Tj
T*(confessed to being, especially early in life, "a me me me person".[241] She saw )Tj
T*(herself as having a happy nature, reasoning "I like life and I've been so )Tj
T*(lucky, why shouldn't I be happy?"[177] )Tj
T*( A. Scott Berg knew Hepburn well in her later years, and said that while she )Tj
T*(was demanding, there remained a sense of humility and humanity.[242] She led an )Tj
T*(active private life, reportedly swimming and playing tennis every morning.[149] )Tj
T*(In her eighties she was still playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her )Tj
T*(1993 documentary All About Me.[29] She also enjoyed painting, which became a )Tj
T*(passion later in life.[243] A small bust she sculpted of Spencer Tracy's head )Tj
T*(was featured in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.[244] )Tj
T*( When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, "I always just )Tj
T*(say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person."[6] The )Tj
T*(anti-communist hysteria in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, )Tj
T*(and she made a speech against censorship in May 1947 that shocked the )Tj
T*(public.[133] Targeted by right-wing activists as a supposed communist )Tj
T*(sympathizer, she was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American )Tj
T*(Activities Committee.[133] She insisted that the claims made about her were )Tj
T*(untrue.[245] For decades, Hepburn openly promoted birth control and supported )Tj
T*(abortion.[29][82] She found great spirituality in existence, practicing Albert )Tj
T*(Schweitzer's theory of "Reverence for Life",[246] but did not believe in )Tj
T*(religion or the afterlife.[6] In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, "I'm an )Tj
T*(atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except that we )Tj
T*(should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people."[247] Her )Tj
T*(public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to )Tj
T*(award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.[248] )Tj
T*( [edit] Relationships )Tj
T*( Hepburn's only husband was Ludlow Ogden Smith, a socialite businessman from )Tj
T*(Philadelphia whom she met while a student at Bryn Mawr. The couple married on )Tj
T*(December 12, 1928, when she was 21 and he was 29.[249] Hepburn made Smith )Tj
T*(change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow so that she would not be known as "Kate )Tj
T*(Smith", which she considered too plain.[34] She never fully committed to the )Tj
T*(relationship and prioritized her career.[249] The move to Hollywood in 1932 )Tj
T*(cemented the couple's estrangement,[250] and in 1934, she traveled to Mexico to )Tj
T*(get a quick divorce. Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his )Tj
T*(financial and moral support in the early days of her career, and in her )Tj
T*(autobiography called herself "a terrible pig" for exploiting his love.[251] The )Tj
T*(pair remained friends until his death in 1979.[252] )Tj
T*( Soon after moving to California, Hepburn began a relationship with her agent )Tj
T*(Leland Hayward. Both were married.[67] Hayward proposed to Hepburn after they )Tj
T*(had each divorced, but she did not wish to be married again.[253] She "liked )Tj
T*(the idea of being my own single self."[254] They were involved for four )Tj
T*(years.[255] In 1936, while she was touring Jane Eyre, Hepburn began a )Tj
T*(relationship with entrepreneur Howard Hughes. They first met while Hepburn was )Tj
T*(filming Sylvia Scarlett, when they were introduced by their mutual friend Cary )Tj
T*(Grant.[256] Hughes wished to marry her, and the tabloids reported their )Tj
T*(impending nuptials, but at that time Hepburn was too focused on resurrecting )Tj
T*(her failing career.[257] They separated in 1938, when Hepburn left Hollywood )Tj

T*(to have children. She felt that motherhood should be a full-time commitment, )Tj
T*(and it was not one she was willing to make.[6] "I would have been a terrible )Tj
T*(mother," she told Berg, "because I'm basically a very selfish human )Tj
T*(being."[259] She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much )Tj
T*(younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own.[260] )Tj
T*(Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or )Tj
T*(bisexual.[261] In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in )Tj
T*(which he argued this was the case.[262] In response to this speculation about )Tj
T*(her aunt, Katharine Houghton said, "I've never discovered any evidence )Tj
T*(whatsoever that she was a lesbian."[263] )Tj
T*( [edit] Spencer Tracy )Tj
T*( The most significant relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy. In )Tj
T*(her autobiography she wrote, "It was a unique feeling that I had for [Tracy]. I )Tj
T*(would have done anything for him."[264]Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later )Tj
T*(wrote of how "blindingly" in love Hepburn was with the actor.[265] The )Tj
T*(relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as )Tj
T*(one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs.[218][236][266] Meeting when she was )Tj
T*(34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed that she had )Tj
T*(dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian,[267] but Hepburn said )Tj
T*(she "knew right away that I found him irresistible."[268] Tracy remained )Tj
T*(married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been )Tj
T*(living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and )Tj
T*(neither party pursued a divorce.[269] Hepburn did not interfere, and never )Tj
T*(fought for marriage.[270] With Tracy determined to conceal the relationship )Tj
T*(with Hepburn from his wife, it had to remain private.[271] They were careful )Tj
T*(not to be seen in public together, and maintained separate )Tj
T*(residences.[266][272] Tracy was a periodic alcoholic and troubled individual, )Tj
T*(whom Hepburn described as "tortured" by guilt and misery,[273] and she devoted )Tj
T*(herself to making his life easier.[274] Reports from people who saw them )Tj
T*(together describe how Hepburn's entire demeanor changed when around Tracy.[275] )Tj
T*(She mothered and obeyed him, and Tracy became heavily dependent on her.[276] )Tj
T*(They often spent stretches of time apart due to their work, particularly in the )Tj
T*(1950s when Hepburn was largely abroad for career commitments.[277] )Tj
T*( Tracy's health declined significantly in the 1960s, and Hepburn took a )Tj
T*(five-year break in her career to care for him.[177] She moved into Tracy's )Tj
T*(house for this period, and was with him when he died on June 10, 1967.[278] Out )Tj
T*(of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral.[279] It )Tj
T*(was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak )Tj
T*(publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star.[280] In response to the )Tj
T*(question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their )Tj
T*(relationship, she said, "I honestly don't know. I can only say that I could )Tj
T*(never have left him."[177] She claimed not to know how Tracy felt about )Tj
T*(her[281] and that they "just passed twenty-seven years [sic] together in what )Tj
T*(was to me absolute bliss."[281] )Tj
T*( [edit] Final years and death )Tj
T*( Hepburn stated in her eighties, "I have no fear of death. Must be wonderful, )Tj
T*(like a long sleep."[29] Her health began to deteriorate not long after her )Tj
T*(final screen appearance. In the winter of 1996 she was hospitalized with )Tj
T*(pneumonia.[282] By 1997 she had become very weak, was speaking and eating very )Tj
T*(little, and it was feared she would die.[283] She showed signs of dementia in )Tj
T*(her final years.[284] In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn's )Tj
T*(neck. The decision was made not to medically intervene,[285] and she died on )Tj
T*(June 29, 2003, at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut. She was 96 )Tj
T*(years old and was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery, Hartford. Hepburn requested )Tj
T*(that there be no memorial service.[286] )Tj
T*( Hepburn's death received considerable public attention. Many tributes were )Tj
T*(held on television, and newspapers and magazines dedicated issues to the )Tj
T*(actress.[287] American president George W. Bush said Hepburn "will be )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( "Her best films were when she was presented as a woman on her high horse with )Tj
T*(slightly pretentious, often comically stated ideas about the world. It was for )Tj
T*(men to bring her down and get her to reveal herself as quite a good gal, sporty )Tj
T*(and democratic. We liked the idea that aristocratic people would be humanized )Tj
T*(by democratic values‚Äîin her case, by slightly rough-necked and good-natured )Tj
T*(males."[176] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( ‚ÄîFilm historian and critic Richard Schickel explains the typical Hepburn role )Tj
T*(and its appeal. )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( According to reports, Hepburn was not an instinctive actor.[290] She liked to )Tj
T*(study the text and character carefully beforehand, making sure she knew them )Tj
T*(thoroughly, and then to rehearse as much as possible and film multiple takes of )Tj
T*(a scene.[184] With a genuine passion for the industry she committed heavily to )Tj
T*(each role,[291] and insisted on learning any necessary skills and performing )Tj
T*(stunts herself.[292] She was known to learn not only her own lines but also )Tj
T*(those of her co-stars.[293] Commenting on her motivation, Stanley Kramer said, )Tj
T*("Work, work, work. She can work till everyone drops."[294] Hepburn involved )Tj
T*(herself in the production of each of her films, making suggestions for the )Tj
T*(script and stating her opinion on everything from costumes to lighting to )Tj
T*(camerawork.[295] )Tj
T*( The characters Hepburn played were, with very few exceptions, wealthy and )Tj
T*(intelligent, and often strong and independent.[296] These tough characters )Tj
T*(tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden )Tj
T*(vulnerability.[297] Garson Kanin described what he called "the formula for a )Tj
T*(Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by )Tj
T*(an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have )Tj
T*(worked time and time again."[298] Due to this repeated character arc, Britton )Tj
T*(sees Hepburn as embodying the "contradictions" of the "nature and status of )Tj
T*(women",[299] as the strong females she depicts are eventually "restored to a )Tj
T*(safe position within the status quo".[300] Film critic Molly Haskell has )Tj
T*(commented on the importance of this to Hepburn's career: with an intimidating )Tj
T*(presence, it was necessary that her characters "do some kind of self-abasement, )Tj
T*(to stay on the good side of the audience."[82] )Tj
T*( Hepburn is one of America's most celebrated actresses,[301] but she has also )Tj
T*(been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her on-screen persona closely )Tj
T*(matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 )Tj
T*(she told a journalist, "I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite )Tj
T*(personality and I liked material that showed that personality."[266] Playwright )Tj
T*(and author David Macaray has said, "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie )Tj
T*(she ever starred in and ask yourself if she's not playing, essentially, the )Tj
T*(same part over and over¬†... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly )Tj

T*(Time".[306] In 1999, the American Film Institute named Hepburn the "greatest )Tj
T*(American screen legend" among females.[1] )Tj
T*( The legacy of Hepburn lies both on screen and off. Broadcaster Sheridan Morley )Tj
T*(has said she "broke the mold" for women in Hollywood,[307] where she brought a )Tj
T*(new breed of strong-willed females to the screen.[232] Film academic Andrew )Tj
T*(Britton wrote a monograph studying Hepburn's "key presence within classical )Tj
T*(Hollywood, a consistent, potentially radical disturbance",[300] and pinpoints )Tj
T*(her "central" influence in bringing feminist issues to the screen.[299] Maryann )Tj
T*(Pasda DiEdwardo has claimed that Hepburn's performances fostered a )Tj
T*("decisiveness toward a new vision of women."[308] Off screen, Hepburn lived in )Tj
T*(a manner ahead of her time.[238] She thus came to symbolize the "modern woman" )Tj
T*(and played a part in changing attitudes towards the gender.[82][309] Horton and )Tj
T*(Simmons write, "Confident, intelligent and witty, four-time Oscar winner )Tj
T*(Katharine Hepburn defied convention throughout her professional and personal )Tj
T*(life ... Hepburn provided an image of an assertive woman whom [females] could )Tj
T*(watch and learn from."[310] After Hepburn's death, film historian Jeanine )Tj
T*(Basinger stated, "What she brought us was a new kind of heroine‚Äîmodern and )Tj
T*(independent. She was beautiful, but she did not rely on that."[176] Mary )Tj
T*(McNamara, an entertainment journalist and reviewer for the Los Angeles Times )Tj
T*(wrote, "More than a movie star, Katharine Hepburn was the patron saint of the )Tj
T*(independent American female."[82] She was not universally revered by feminists, )Tj
T*(however, who were angered by her public declarations that women "cannot have it )Tj
T*(all", meaning a family and a career.[82] )Tj
T*( Hepburn's legacy extends to fashion, where she was a pioneer for wearing )Tj
T*(trousers at a time when it was radical for a woman to do so.[311] She )Tj
T*(contributed towards making trousers acceptable for women, as fans began to )Tj
T*(imitate her clothing.[218][312] In 1986 she received a lifetime achievement )Tj
T*(award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in recognition of the )Tj

T*( Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet, OM, GCVO \(2 June 1857 ‚Äì 23 February )Tj
T*(1934\) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and )Tj
T*(international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions )Tj
T*(are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance )Tj
T*(Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed )Tj
T*(choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was )Tj
T*(appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. )Tj
T*( Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his )Tj
T*(musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt )Tj
T*(himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles )Tj
T*(dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, )Tj
T*(his Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the )Tj
T*(class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely )Tj
T*(sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He )Tj
T*(nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She )Tj
T*(inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success )Tj
T*(until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his )Tj
T*(Enigma Variations \(1899\) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He )Tj
T*(followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius \(1900\), )Tj
T*(based on a Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican )Tj
T*(establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory )Tj
T*(work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works )Tj
T*(were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. The first of his )Tj
T*(Pomp and Circumstance Marches \(1901\) is well known in the English-speaking )Tj
T*(world. )Tj
T*( In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were )Tj
T*(immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain )Tj
T*(immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in )Tj
T*(the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later )Tj
T*(years, to be seen as appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained )Tj
T*(low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the )Tj
T*(1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent )Tj
T*(years, been taken up again internationally, but the music remains more played )Tj
T*(in Britain than elsewhere. )Tj
T*( Elgar has been described as the first composer to take the gramophone )Tj
T*(seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of acoustic recordings )Tj
T*(of his works. The introduction of the microphone in 1925 made far more accurate )Tj
T*(sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major )Tj
T*(orchestral works and excerpts from The Dream of Gerontius. )Tj
T*( Biography )Tj
T*( Early years )Tj
T*( Edward Elgar was born in the small village of Lower Broadheath, outside )Tj
T*(Worcester, England. His father, William Henry Elgar \(1821‚Äì1906\), was raised in )Tj
T*(Dover and had been apprenticed to a London music publisher. In 1841 William )Tj
T*(moved to Worcester, where he worked as a piano tuner and set up a shop selling )Tj
T*(sheet music and musical instruments.[1] In 1848 he married Ann Greening )Tj
T*(\(1822‚Äì1902\), daughter of a farm worker.[2] Edward was the fourth of their seven )Tj
T*(children.[n 1] Ann Elgar had converted to Catholicism shortly before Edward's )Tj
T*(birth, and he was baptised and brought up as a Catholic, to the disapproval of )Tj
T*(his father.[n 2] William Elgar was a violinist of professional standard and )Tj
T*(held the post of organist of St. George's Catholic Church, Worcester, from 1846 )Tj
T*(to 1885. At his instigation, masses by Cherubini and Hummel were first heard at )Tj
T*(the Three Choirs Festival by the orchestra in which he played the violin.[5] )Tj
T*(All the Elgar children received a musical upbringing. By the age of eight, )Tj
T*(Elgar was taking piano and violin lessons, and his father, who tuned the pianos )Tj
T*(at many grand houses in Worcestershire, would sometimes take him along, giving )Tj
T*(him the chance to display his skill to important local figures.[1] )Tj
T*( Elgar's mother was interested in the arts and encouraged his musical )Tj
T*(development.[2] He inherited from her a discerning taste for literature and a )Tj
T*(passionate love of the countryside.[6] His friend and biographer W. H. "Billy" )Tj

T*(Reed wrote that Elgar's early surroundings had an influence that "permeated all )Tj
T*(his work and gave to his whole life that subtle but none the less true and )Tj
T*(sturdy English quality."[7][n 3] He began composing at an early age; for a play )Tj
T*(written and acted by the Elgar children when he was about ten, he wrote music )Tj
T*(that forty years later he rearranged with only minor changes and orchestrated )Tj
T*(as the suites titled The Wand of Youth.[2] )Tj
T*( Until he was fifteen, Elgar received a general education at Littleton \(now )Tj
T*(Lyttleton\)[n 4] House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical )Tj
T*(training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers was more advanced )Tj
T*(violin studies with Adolf Pollitzer, during brief visits to London in 1877‚Äì78. )Tj
T*(Elgar said "my first music was learnt in the Cathedral ... from books borrowed )Tj
T*(from the music library, when I was eight, nine or ten."[10] He worked through )Tj
T*(manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on )Tj
T*(the theory of music.[5] He later said that he had been most helped by Hubert )Tj
T*(Parry's articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.[11] Elgar )Tj
T*(began to learn German, in the hope of going to the Leipzig Conservatory for )Tj
T*(further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years )Tj
T*(later a profile in The Musical Times considered that his failure to get to )Tj
T*(Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: "Thus the budding )Tj
T*(composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools."[5] However, it was a )Tj
T*(disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig )Tj
T*(but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office )Tj
T*(career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to )Tj
T*(literature, becoming a voracious reader.[n 5] Around this time, he made his )Tj
T*(first public appearances as a violinist and organist.[13] )Tj
T*( After a few months, Elgar left the solicitor to embark on a musical career, )Tj
T*(giving piano and violin lessons and working occasionally in his father's )Tj
T*(shop.[1] He was an active member of the Worcester Glee Club, along with his )Tj
T*(father, and he accompanied singers, played the violin, composed and arranged )Tj
T*(works, and conducted for the first time. Pollitzer believed that, as a )Tj
T*(violinist, Elgar had the potential to be one of the leading soloists in the )Tj
T*(country,[14] but Elgar himself, having heard leading virtuosi at London )Tj
T*(concerts, felt his own violin playing lacked a full enough tone, and he )Tj
T*(abandoned his ambitions to be a soloist.[1] At twenty-two he took up the post )Tj
T*(of conductor of the attendants' band at the Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum )Tj
T*(in Powick, three miles \(5¬†km\) from Worcester.[5] The band consisted of: )Tj
T*(piccolo, flute, clarinet, two cornets, euphonium, three or four first and a )Tj
T*(similar number of second violins, occasional viola, cello, double bass and )Tj
T*(piano.[15] Elgar coached the players and wrote and arranged their music, )Tj
T*(including quadrilles and polkas, for the unusual combination of instruments. )Tj
T*(The Musical Times wrote, "This practical experience proved to be of the )Tj
T*(greatest value to the young musician. ... He acquired a practical knowledge of )Tj
T*(the capabilities of these different instruments. ... He thereby got to know )Tj
T*(intimately the tone colour, the ins and outs of these and many other )Tj
T*(instruments."[5] He held the post for five years, from 1879, travelling to )Tj
T*(Powick once a week.[1] Another post he held in his early days was professor of )Tj
T*(the violin at the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.[5] )Tj
T*( Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar thrived in )Tj
T*(Worcester's musical circles.[2] He played in the violins at the Worcester and )Tj
T*(Birmingham Festivals, and one great experience was to play Dvo≈ô√°k's Symphony )Tj
T*(No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton.[16] Elgar regularly played )Tj
T*(the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist \(and )Tj
T*(conductor who ran his own wind band\).[5] Elgar arranged numerous pieces by )Tj
T*(Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and )Tj
T*(compositional skills.[5] )Tj
T*( In his first trips abroad, Elgar visited Paris in 1880 and Leipzig in 1882. He )Tj
T*(heard Saint-Sa√´ns play the organ at the Madeleine and attended concerts by )Tj
T*(first-rate orchestras. In 1882 he wrote, "I got pretty well dosed with Schumann )Tj
T*(\(my ideal!\), Brahms, Rubinstein &amp; Wagner, so had no cause to complain."[10] )Tj
T*(In Leipzig he visited a friend, Helen Weaver, who was a student at the )Tj

T*(Conservatoire. They became engaged in the summer of 1883, but for unknown )Tj
T*(reasons the engagement was broken off the next year .[1] Elgar was greatly )Tj
T*(distressed, and some of his later cryptic dedications of romantic music may )Tj
T*(have alluded to Helen and his feelings for her.[n 6] Throughout his life, Elgar )Tj
T*(was often inspired by close women friends; Helen Weaver was succeeded by Mary )Tj
T*(Lygon, Dora Penny, Julia Worthington, Alice Stuart Wortley and finally Vera )Tj
T*(Hockman, who enlivened his old age.[17] )Tj
T*( In 1883, while a regular member of the orchestra for W. C. Stockley's winter )Tj
T*(concert seasons in Birmingham, Elgar took part in a performance of one of his )Tj
T*(first works for full orchestra, the S√©r√©nade mauresque. Stockley had invited )Tj
T*(him to conduct the piece, but, as Stockley later recalled, "he declined, and, )Tj
T*(further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence )Tj
T*(was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and )Tj
T*(hearty applause of the audience."[18] He often went to London in an attempt to )Tj
T*(get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently )Tj
T*(despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, "My prospects )Tj
T*(are about as hopeless as ever ... I am not wanting in energy I think, so )Tj
T*(sometimes I conclude that 'tis want of ability. ... I have no money ‚Äì not a )Tj
T*(cent."[19] For a number of years he was assistant to his father, William Elgar, )Tj
T*(as organist of St George's Catholic Church, Worcester, and succeeded him for )Tj
T*(four years from 1885. During this period he wrote his first liturgical works in )Tj
T*(the Catholic tradition, beginning with his three motets Op. 2 \(1887\) for )Tj
T*(four-part choir \(Ave Verum Corpus, Ave Maria and Ave Maris Stella\), and )Tj
T*(followed by a setting of Ecce sacerdos magnus for the entry of the Bishop on an )Tj
T*(official visit to St. George's in 1888, all four of which remain in the )Tj
T*(repertoire of church choirs. )Tj
T*( Marriage )Tj
T*( When Elgar was twenty-nine, he took on a new pupil, Caroline Alice Roberts, )Tj
T*(daughter of the late Major-General Sir Henry Roberts, and a published author of )Tj
T*(verse and prose fiction. Eight years older than Elgar, Alice became his wife )Tj
T*(three years later. Elgar's biographer Michael Kennedy writes, "Alice's family )Tj
T*(was horrified by her intention to marry an unknown musician who worked in a )Tj
T*(shop and was a Catholic. She was disinherited."[1] They were married on 8 May )Tj
T*(1889, at Brompton Oratory.[16] From then until her death she acted as his )Tj
T*(business manager and social secretary, dealt with his mood swings and was a )Tj
T*(perceptive musical critic.[20][21] She did her best to gain him the attention )Tj
T*(of influential society, though with limited success.[22] In time he would learn )Tj
T*(to accept the honours given him, realising that they mattered more to her and )Tj
T*(her social class and recognising what she had given up to further his career.[n )Tj
T*(7] In her diary she wrote, "The care of a genius is enough of a life work for )Tj
T*(any woman."[24] As an engagement present, Elgar dedicated his short violin and )Tj
T*(piano piece Salut d'Amour to her.[n 8] With Alice's encouragement, the Elgars )Tj
T*(moved to London to be closer to the centre of British musical life, and Elgar )Tj
T*(started devoting his time to composition. Their only child, Carice Irene, was )Tj
T*(born at their home in West Kensington on 14 August 1890. Her name, revealed in )Tj
T*(Elgar's dedication of Salut d'Amour, was a contraction of her mother's names )Tj
T*(Caroline and Alice. )Tj
T*( Elgar took full advantage of the opportunity to hear unfamiliar music. In the )Tj
T*(days before miniature scores and recordings were available, it was not easy for )Tj
T*(young composers to get to know new music.[25] Elgar took every chance to do so )Tj
T*(at the Crystal Palace concerts. He and Alice attended day after day, hearing )Tj
T*(music by a wide range of composers. Among these were masters of orchestration )Tj
T*(from whom he learned much, such as Berlioz and Wagner.[2] His own compositions, )Tj
T*(however, made little impact on London's musical scene. August Manns conducted )Tj
T*(Elgar's orchestral version of Salut d'amour and the Suite in D at the Crystal )Tj
T*(Palace, and two publishers accepted some of Elgar's violin pieces, organ )Tj
T*(voluntaries, and partsongs.[26] Some tantalising opportunities seemed to be )Tj
T*(within reach but vanished unexpectedly.[26] For example, an offer from the )Tj
T*(Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, to run through some of his works was )Tj
T*(withdrawn at the last second when Sir Arthur Sullivan arrived unannounced to )Tj

T*(rehearse some of his own music. Sullivan was horrified when Elgar later told )Tj
T*(him what had happened.[n 9] Elgar's only important commission while in London )Tj
T*(came from his home city: the Worcester Festival Committee invited him to )Tj
T*(compose a short orchestral work for the 1890 Three Choirs Festival.[28] The )Tj
T*(result is described by Diana McVeagh in the Grove Dictionary of Music and )Tj
T*(Musicians, as "his first major work, the assured and uninhibited Froissart." )Tj
T*(Elgar conducted the first performance in Worcester in September 1890.[2] For )Tj
T*(lack of other work, he was obliged to leave London in 1891 and return with his )Tj
T*(wife and child to Worcestershire, where he could earn a living conducting local )Tj
T*(musical ensembles and teaching. They settled in Alice's former home town, Great )Tj
T*(Malvern.[2] )Tj
T*( Growing reputation )Tj
T*( During the 1890s, Elgar gradually built up a reputation as a composer, chiefly )Tj
T*(of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black )Tj
T*(Knight \(1892\) and King Olaf \(1896\), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of )Tj
T*(Life \(1896\) and Caractacus \(1898\) were all modestly successful, and he obtained )Tj
T*(a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co.[29] Other works of this decade )Tj
T*(included the Serenade for Strings \(1892\) and Three Bavarian Dances \(1897\). )Tj
T*(Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel )Tj
T*(Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped )Tj
T*(establish the younger man's career.[n 10] Elgar was catching the attention of )Tj
T*(prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. )Tj
T*(Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by )Tj
T*(financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was "very sick at heart )Tj
T*(over music" and hoped to find a way to succeed with a larger work. His friend )Tj
T*(August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: "A day's attack of the blues ... will )Tj
T*(not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative )Tj
T*(faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal )Tj
T*(recognition will come."[31] )Tj
T*( In 1899, that prediction suddenly came true. At the age of forty-two, Elgar )Tj
T*(produced the Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton )Tj
T*(of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, "I have )Tj
T*(sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused )Tj
T*(me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... )Tj
T*(that is to say I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of )Tj
T*(the 'party' \(the person\) ... and have written what I think they would have )Tj
T*(written ‚Äì if they were asses enough to compose".[32] He dedicated the work "To )Tj
T*(my friends pictured within". Probably the best known variation is "Nimrod", )Tj
T*(depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations )Tj
T*(depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to )Tj
T*(incorporate in the variations.[33] The large-scale work was received with )Tj
T*(general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it )Tj
T*(established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.[2] )Tj
T*( The work is formally titled Variations on an Original Theme; the word "Enigma" )Tj
T*(appears over the first six bars of music, which led to the familiar version of )Tj
T*(the title. The enigma is that, although there are fourteen variations on the )Tj
T*("original theme", there is another overarching theme, never identified by )Tj
T*(Elgar, which he said "runs through and over the whole set" but is never )Tj
T*(heard.[n 11] Later commentators have observed that although Elgar is today )Tj
T*(regarded as a characteristically English composer, his orchestral music and )Tj
T*(this work in particular share much with the Central European tradition typified )Tj
T*(at the time by the work of Richard Strauss.[1][2] The Enigma Variations were )Tj
T*(well received in Germany and Italy,[35] and remain to the present day a )Tj
T*(worldwide concert staple.[n 12] )Tj
T*( National and international fame )Tj
T*( Elgar's biographer Basil Maine commented, "When Sir Arthur Sullivan died in )Tj
T*(1900 it became apparent to many that Elgar, although a composer of another )Tj
T*(build, was his true successor as first musician of the land."[16] Elgar's next )Tj
T*(major work was eagerly awaited.[36] For the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival )Tj
T*(of 1900, he set Cardinal John Henry Newman's poem The Dream of Gerontius for )Tj

T*(soloists, chorus and orchestra. Richter conducted the premiere, which was )Tj
T*(marred by a poorly prepared chorus, which sang badly.[37] Elgar was deeply )Tj
T*(depressed, but the critics recognised the mastery of the piece despite the )Tj
T*(defects in performance.[1] It was performed in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, in 1901 and )Tj
T*(again in 1902, conducted by Julius Buths, who also conducted the European )Tj
T*(premiere of the Enigma Variations in 1901. The German press was enthusiastic. )Tj
T*(The Cologne Gazette said, "In both parts we meet with beauties of imperishable )Tj
T*(value. ... Elgar stands on the shoulders of Berlioz, Wagner, and Liszt, from )Tj
T*(whose influences he has freed himself until he has become an important )Tj
T*(individuality. He is one of the leaders of musical art of modern times." The )Tj
T*(D√ºsseldorfer Volksblatt wrote, "A memorable and epoch-making first performance! )Tj
T*(Since the days of Liszt nothing has been produced in the way of oratorio ... )Tj
T*(which reaches the greatness and importance of this sacred cantata."[38] Richard )Tj
T*(Strauss, then widely viewed as the leading composer of his day,[39] was so )Tj
T*(impressed that in Elgar's presence he proposed a toast to the success of "the )Tj
T*(first English progressive musician, Meister Elgar."[39][n 13] Performances in )Tj
T*(Vienna, Paris and New York followed,[2][41] and The Dream of Gerontius soon )Tj
T*(became equally admired in Britain. According to Kennedy, "It is unquestionably )Tj
T*(the greatest British work in the oratorio form ... [it] opened a new chapter in )Tj
T*(the English choral tradition and liberated it from its Handelian )Tj
T*(preoccupation."[1] Elgar, as a Catholic, was much moved by Newman's poem about )Tj
T*(the death and redemption of a sinner, but some influential members of the )Tj
T*(Anglican establishment disagreed. His colleague, Charles Villiers Stanford )Tj
T*(complained that the work "stinks of incense".[42] The Dean of Gloucester banned )Tj
T*(Gerontius from his cathedral in 1901, and at Worcester the following year, the )Tj
T*(Dean insisted on expurgations before allowing a performance.[43] )Tj
T*( Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance )Tj
T*(Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930.[44] It is familiar to )Tj
T*(millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last )Tj
T*(Night of the Proms,[45] where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of )Tj
T*(the slower middle section \(technically called the "trio"\) of the first march )Tj
T*(came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, "I've got a tune that will )Tj
T*(knock 'em¬†‚Äì will knock 'em flat".[46] When the first march was played in 1901 )Tj
T*(at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later )Tj
T*(wrote that the audience "rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the )Tj
T*(history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double )Tj
T*(encore."[47] To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to )Tj
T*(set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House )Tj
T*(in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The )Tj
T*(contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and )Tj
T*(Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to )Tj
T*(do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of )Tj
T*(the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, "Land of Hope and )Tj
T*(Glory", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication )Tj
T*(as a separate song.[48] It was immensely popular and is now considered an )Tj
T*(unofficial British national anthem.[1] In the United States, the trio, known )Tj
T*(simply as "Pomp and Circumstance" or "The Graduation March", has been adopted )Tj
T*(since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.[49][50] )Tj
T*( In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent )Tj
T*(Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times )Tj
T*(commented, "Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the )Tj
T*(Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an )Tj
T*(oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out )Tj
T*(of his mind."[51] The king and queen attended the first concert, at which )Tj
T*(Richter conducted The Dream of Gerontius,[51] and returned the next evening for )Tj
T*(the second, the London premiere of The Apostles \(first heard the previous year )Tj
T*(at the Birmingham Festival\).[52] The final concert of the festival, conducted )Tj
T*(by Elgar, was primarily orchestral, apart for an excerpt from Caractacus and )Tj

T*(work, In the South \(Alassio\), inspired by a holiday in Italy.[53] )Tj
T*( Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904.[54] The following )Tj
T*(month, he and his family moved to Pl√¢s Gwyn,[55] a large house on the outskirts )Tj
T*(of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911.[1] Between )Tj
T*(1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity.[1] )Tj
T*(He made four visits to the U.S., including one conducting tour, and earned )Tj
T*(considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he )Tj
T*(held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham.[2] )Tj
T*(He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a )Tj
T*(school of music.[56] He was not at ease in the role,[57] and his lectures )Tj
T*(caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics[58][n 14] and on English )Tj
T*(music in general: "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity )Tj
T*(often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be )Tj
T*(anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, )Tj
T*(beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white ‚Äì all over )Tj
T*(white ‚Äì and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own )Tj
T*(mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of )Tj
T*(taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." He )Tj
T*(regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend )Tj
T*(Granville Bantock in 1908.[61] His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing )Tj
T*(to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in )Tj
T*(ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, "My life is one continual giving )Tj
T*(up of little things which I love."[62] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy )Tj
T*(sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have )Tj
T*(collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.[63] )Tj
T*( Elgar's principal composition in 1905 was the Introduction and Allegro for )Tj
T*(Strings, dedicated to Samuel Sanford, professor at Yale University. Elgar )Tj
T*(visited America in that year to conduct his music and to accept a doctorate )Tj
T*(from Yale.[2][n 15] His next large-scale work was the sequel to The Apostles ‚Äì )Tj
T*(the oratorio The Kingdom \(1906\). It was well received but did not catch the )Tj
T*(public imagination as The Dream of Gerontius had done and continued to do. )Tj
T*(Among keen Elgarians, however, The Kingdom was sometimes preferred to the )Tj
T*(earlier work: Elgar's friend Frank Schuster told the young Adrian Boult: )Tj
T*("compared with The Kingdom, Gerontius is the work of a raw amateur."[64] As )Tj
T*(Elgar approached his fiftieth birthday, he began work on his first symphony, a )Tj
T*(project that had been in his mind in various forms for nearly ten years.[65] )Tj
T*(His First Symphony \(1908\) was a national and international triumph. Within )Tj
T*(weeks of the premiere it was performed in New York under Walter Damrosch, )Tj
T*(Vienna under Ferdinand L√∂we, St. Petersburg under Alexander Siloti, and Leipzig )Tj
T*(under Arthur Nikisch. There were performances in Rome, Chicago, Boston, Toronto )Tj
T*(and fifteen British towns and cities. In just over a year, it received a )Tj
T*(hundred performances in Britain, America and continental Europe.[66] )Tj
T*( The Violin Concerto \(1910\) was commissioned by Fritz Kreisler, one of the )Tj
T*(leading international violinists of the time. Elgar wrote it during the summer )Tj
T*(of 1910, with occasional help from the violinist W. H. Reed, the leader of the )Tj
T*(London Symphony Orchestra, who helped the composer with advice on technical )Tj
T*(points. Elgar and Reed formed a firm friendship, which lasted for the rest of )Tj
T*(Elgar's life. Reed's biography, Elgar As I Knew Him \(1936\), records many )Tj
T*(details of Elgar's methods of composition.[67] The work was presented by the )Tj
T*(Royal Philharmonic Society, with Kreisler and the London Symphony Orchestra )Tj
T*(\(LSO\), conducted by the composer. Reed recalled, "the Concerto proved to be a )Tj
T*(complete triumph, the concert a brilliant and unforgettable occasion".[68] So )Tj
T*(great was the impact of the concerto that Kreisler's rival Eug√®ne Ysa√øe spent )Tj
T*(much time with Elgar going through the work. There was great disappointment )Tj
T*(when contractual difficulties prevented Ysa√øe from playing it in London.[68] )Tj
T*( The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The following year he )Tj
T*(presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception. )Tj
T*(Unlike the First Symphony, it ends not in a blaze of orchestral splendour but )Tj

T*(Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, )Tj
T*("but missed that unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English )Tj
T*(audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as it was after the Violin )Tj
T*(Concerto or the First Symphony."[69] Elgar asked Reed, "What is the matter with )Tj
T*(them, Billy? They sit there like a lot of stuffed pigs."[69] The work was, by )Tj
T*(normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years )Tj
T*(of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international furore of the First )Tj
T*(Symphony.[70] )Tj
T*( Last major works )Tj
T*( In June 1911, as part of the celebrations surrounding the coronation of King )Tj
T*(George V, Elgar was appointed to the Order of Merit,[71] an exclusive honour )Tj
T*(limited to twenty-four holders at any time. The following year, the Elgars )Tj
T*(moved back to London, to a large house in Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, )Tj
T*(designed by Norman Shaw. There Elgar composed his last two large-scale works of )Tj
T*(the pre-war era, the choral ode, The Music Makers \(for the Birmingham Festival, )Tj
T*(1912\) and the symphonic study Falstaff \(for the Leeds Festival, 1913\). Both )Tj
T*(were received politely but without enthusiasm. Even the dedicatee of Falstaff, )Tj
T*(the conductor Landon Ronald, confessed privately that he could not "make head )Tj
T*(or tail of the piece,"[72] while the musical scholar Percy Scholes wrote of )Tj
T*(Falstaff that it was a "great work" but, "so far as public appreciation goes, a )Tj
T*(comparative failure."[73] )Tj
T*( When World War I broke out, Elgar was horrified at the prospect of the )Tj
T*(carnage, but his patriotic feelings were nonetheless aroused.[74] He composed )Tj
T*("A Song for Soldiers", which he later withdrew. He signed up as a special )Tj
T*(constable in the local police and later joined the Hampstead Volunteer Reserve )Tj
T*(of the army.[75] He composed patriotic works, Carillon, a recitation for )Tj
T*(speaker and orchestra in honour of Belgium,[76] and Polonia, an orchestral )Tj
T*(piece in honour of Poland.[77]Land of Hope and Glory, already popular, became )Tj
T*(still more so, and Elgar wished in vain to have new, less nationalistic, words )Tj
T*(sung to the tune.[2] )Tj
T*( Elgar's other compositions during the war included incidental music for a )Tj
T*(children's play, The Starlight Express \(1915\); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan )Tj
T*(\(1917\); and The Spirit of England \(1915‚Äì17, to poems by Laurence Binyon\), three )Tj
T*(choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his )Tj
T*(earlier years.[2] His last large-scale composition of the war years was The )Tj
T*(Fringes of the Fleet, settings of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with )Tj
T*(great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons )Tj
T*(objected to their performance in theatres.[78] Elgar conducted a recording of )Tj
T*(the work for the Gramophone Company.[79] )Tj
T*( Towards the end of the war, Elgar was in poor health. His wife thought it best )Tj
T*(for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near )Tj
T*(Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar recovered )Tj
T*(his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The )Tj
T*(first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in E¬†minor, the )Tj
T*(Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the )Tj
T*(work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, "E. writing wonderful new )Tj
T*(music".[80] All three works were well received. The Times wrote, "Elgar's )Tj
T*(sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, but as we do not )Tj
T*(at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be."[81] )Tj
T*(The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The )Tj
T*(Manchester Guardian wrote, "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious )Tj
T*(refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more )Tj
T*(lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great )Tj
T*(oratorios were of their type."[82] )Tj
T*( By contrast, the remaining work, the Cello Concerto in E minor, had a )Tj
T*(disastrous premiere, at the opening concert of the London Symphony Orchestra's )Tj
T*(1919‚Äì20 season in October 1919. Apart from the Elgar work, which the composer )Tj
T*(conducted, the rest of the programme was conducted by Albert Coates, who )Tj
T*(overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar's. Lady Elgar wrote, "that )Tj

T*(rehearsing."[83] The critic of The Observer, Ernest Newman, wrote, "There have )Tj
T*(been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the )Tj
T*(explanation, the sad fact remains that never, in all probability, has so great )Tj
T*(an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself. ... The work itself is )Tj
T*(lovely stuff, very simple ‚Äì that pregnant simplicity that has come upon Elgar's )Tj
T*(music in the last couple of years ‚Äì but with a profound wisdom and beauty )Tj
T*(underlying its simplicity."[84] Elgar attached no blame to his soloist, Felix )Tj
T*(Salmond, who played for him again later.[85] In contrast with the First )Tj
T*(Symphony and its hundred performances in just over a year, the Cello Concerto )Tj
T*(did not have a second performance in London for more than a year.[86] )Tj
T*( Last years )Tj
T*( Although in the 1920s Elgar's music was no longer in fashion,[1] his admirers )Tj
T*(continued to present his works when possible. Reed singles out a performance of )Tj
T*(the Second Symphony in March 1920 conducted by "a young man almost unknown to )Tj
T*(the public", Adrian Boult, for bringing "the grandeur and nobility of the work" )Tj
T*(to a wider public. Also in 1920, Landon Ronald presented an all-Elgar concert )Tj
T*(at the Queen's Hall.[87] Alice Elgar wrote with enthusiasm about the reception )Tj
T*(of the symphony, but this was one of the last times she heard Elgar's music )Tj
T*(played in public.[88] After a short illness, she died of lung cancer on 7 April )Tj
T*(1920, at the age of seventy-two.[89] )Tj
T*( Elgar was devastated by the loss of his wife.[85] With no public demand for )Tj
T*(new works, and deprived of Alice's constant support and inspiration, he allowed )Tj
T*(himself to be deflected from composition. His daughter later wrote that Elgar )Tj
T*(inherited from his father a reluctance to "settle down to work on hand but )Tj
T*(could cheerfully spend hours over some perfectly unnecessary and entirely )Tj
T*(unremunerative undertaking", a trait that became stronger after Alice's )Tj
T*(death.[90] For much of the rest of his life, Elgar indulged himself in his )Tj
T*(several hobbies.[1] Throughout his life he was a keen amateur chemist, )Tj
T*(sometimes using a laboratory in his back garden.[91] He enjoyed football, )Tj
T*(supporting Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., for whom he composed an anthem, "He )Tj
T*(Banged the Leather for Goal",[92] and in his later years he frequently attended )Tj
T*(horseraces. His prot√©g√©s, the conductor Malcolm Sargent and violinist Yehudi )Tj
T*(Menuhin, both recalled rehearsals with Elgar at which he swiftly satisfied )Tj
T*(himself that all was well and then went off to the races.[93][94] In his )Tj
T*(younger days, Elgar had been an enthusiastic bicyclist, buying Royal Sunbeam )Tj
T*(bicycles for himself and his wife in 1903 \(he named his "Mr. Phoebus\)"[95] As )Tj
T*(an elderly widower, he enjoyed being driven about the countryside by his )Tj
T*(chauffeur.[1] In 1923, he took a voyage to South America, journeying up the )Tj
T*(Amazon. Almost nothing is recorded about the events that Elgar encountered )Tj
T*(during the trip, which gave the historical novelist James Hamilton-Paterson )Tj
T*(considerable latitude when writing Gerontius, a fictional account of the )Tj
T*(journey.[96] )Tj
T*( After Alice's death, Elgar sold the Hampstead house, and after living for a )Tj
T*(short time in a flat in St James's in the heart of London, he moved back to )Tj
T*(Worcestershire, to the village of Kempsey, where he lived from 1923 to )Tj
T*(1927.[97] He did not wholly abandon composition in these years. He made )Tj
T*(large-scale symphonic arrangements of works by Bach and Handel and wrote his )Tj
T*(Empire March and eight songs Pageant of Empire for the 1924 British Empire )Tj
T*(Exhibition.[98] Shortly after these were published, he was appointed Master of )Tj
T*(the King's Musick on 13 May 1924, following the death of Sir Walter )Tj
T*(Parratt.[99] )Tj
T*( From 1926 onwards, Elgar made a series of recordings of his own works. Elgar, )Tj
T*(described by the music writer Robert Philip as "the first composer to take the )Tj
T*(gramophone seriously",[100] had already recorded much of his music by the early )Tj
T*(acoustic-recording process for His Master's Voice \(HMV\) from 1914 onwards, but )Tj
T*(the introduction of electrical microphones in 1925 transformed the gramophone )Tj
T*(from a novelty into a realistic medium for reproducing orchestral and choral )Tj
T*(music.[100] Elgar was the first composer to take full advantage of this )Tj
T*(technological advance.[100]Fred Gaisberg of HMV, who produced Elgar's )Tj

T*(Falstaff, the first and second symphonies, and the cello and violin concertos. )Tj
T*(For most of these, the orchestra was the LSO, but the Variations were played by )Tj
T*(the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra. Later in the series of recordings, Elgar also )Tj
T*(conducted two newly founded orchestras, Boult's BBC Symphony Orchestra and Sir )Tj
T*(Thomas Beecham's London Philharmonic Orchestra. )Tj
T*( Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. )Tj
T*(After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage )Tj
T*(Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other )Tj
T*(recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued )Tj
T*(by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in )Tj
T*(contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since )Tj
T*(Elgar's death.[100] The recordings have subsequently been issued on compact )Tj
T*(disc.[101] These were reissued on CD in the 1990s. )Tj
T*( In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Path√© for a newsreel depicting a )Tj
T*(recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's )Tj
T*(Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound )Tj
T*(film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony )Tj
T*(Orchestra, asking the musicians to "play this tune as though you've never heard )Tj
T*(it before."[102] A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 )Tj
T*(June 1993.[103] )Tj
T*( A late piece of Elgar's, The Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio )Tj
T*(premiere; its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, )Tj
T*(dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew )Tj
T*(on his youthful sketch-books.[2][n 16] )Tj
T*( In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a )Tj
T*(festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932.[104] He )Tj
T*(flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in )Tj
T*(France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at )Tj
T*(Grez-sur-Loing.[16] He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian )Tj
T*(Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it )Tj
T*(was out of fashion.[105][106] He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and )Tj
T*(accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final )Tj
T*(illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished )Tj
T*(works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would "tinker" with the sketches and )Tj
T*(attempt a completion of the symphony,[107] but at other times he said, "If I )Tj
T*(can't complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it ‚Äì or write a )Tj
T*(better one."[108] After Elgar's death, Percy M. Young, in cooperation with the )Tj
T*(BBC and Elgar's daughter Carice, produced a version of The Spanish Lady,[109] )Tj
T*(which was issued on CD. The Third Symphony sketches were elaborated by the )Tj

T*(remained throughout his life.[114] His early adult works included violin and )Tj
T*(piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played )Tj
T*(between 1878‚Äì81, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana )Tj
T*(McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these )Tj
T*(pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and \(as )Tj
T*(arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites\) some of the childhood )Tj
T*(sketches.[2] Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in )Tj
T*(1889‚Äì91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by )Tj
T*(Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics.[2] )Tj
T*(Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include )Tj
T*(the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, )Tj
T*(Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these )Tj
T*(pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, )Tj
T*(a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the )Tj
T*(repertory.[115] )Tj
T*( Elgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for )Tj
T*(the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, )Tj
T*(The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te )Tj
T*(Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments )Tj
T*(favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but )Tj
T*(less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his )Tj
T*(inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s )Tj
T*(were for many years little known \(and performances remain rare\), the mastery of )Tj
T*(his first great success, the Enigma Variations, appeared to be a sudden )Tj
T*(transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had )Tj
T*(been building up throughout the decade.[2] )Tj
T*( Peak creative years )Tj
T*( Elgar's best-known works were composed within the twenty-one years between )Tj
T*(1899 and 1920. Most of them are orchestral. Reed wrote, "Elgar's genius rose to )Tj
T*(its greatest height in his orchestral works" and quoted the composer as saying )Tj
T*(that, even in his oratorios, the orchestral part is the most important.[116] )Tj
T*(The Enigma Variations made Elgar's name nationally. The variation form was )Tj
T*(ideal for him at this stage of his career, when his comprehensive mastery of )Tj
T*(orchestration was still in contrast to his tendency to write his melodies in )Tj
T*(short, sometimes rigid, phrases.[2] His next orchestral works, Cockaigne \(In )Tj
T*(London Town\), a concert-overture \(1900‚Äì1901\), the first two Pomp and )Tj
T*(Circumstance marches \(1901\), and the gentle Dream Children \(1902\), are all )Tj
T*(short: the longest of them, Cockaigne, lasting less than fifteen minutes. In )Tj
T*(the South \(Alassio\) \(1903‚Äì1904\), although designated by Elgar as a )Tj
T*(concert-overture, is, according to Kennedy, really a tone poem and the longest )Tj
T*(continuous piece of purely orchestral writing Elgar had essayed. He wrote it )Tj
T*(after setting aside an early attempt to compose a symphony.[117] The work )Tj
T*(reveals his continuing progress in writing sustained themes and orchestral )Tj
T*(lines, although some critics, including Kennedy, find that in the middle part )Tj
T*("Elgar's inspiration burns at less than its brightest."[118] In 1905 Elgar )Tj
T*(completed the Introduction and Allegro for Strings. This work is based, unlike )Tj
T*(much of Elgar's earlier writing, not on a profusion of themes but on only )Tj
T*(three. Kennedy called it a "masterly composition, equalled among English works )Tj

T*(they derive their vitality and eloquence. Both are based on classical form but )Tj
T*(differ from it to the extent that ... they were considered prolix and slackly )Tj
T*(constructed by some critics. Certainly the invention in them is copious; each )Tj
T*(symphony would need several dozen music examples to chart its progress."[2] )Tj
T*( Elgar's Violin Concerto and Cello Concerto, in the view of Kennedy, "rank not )Tj
T*(only among his finest works, but among the greatest of their kind".[121] They )Tj
T*(are, however, very different from each other. The Violin Concerto, composed in )Tj
T*(1909 as Elgar reached the height of his popularity, and written for the )Tj
T*(instrument dearest to his heart,[115] is lyrical throughout and rhapsodical and )Tj
T*(brilliant by turns.[122] The Cello Concerto, composed a decade later, )Tj
T*(immediately after World War I, seems, in Kennedy's words, "to belong to another )Tj
T*(age, another world ... the simplest of all Elgar's major works ... also the )Tj
T*(least grandiloquent."[123] Between the two concertos came Elgar's symphonic )Tj
T*(study Falstaff, which has divided opinion even among Elgar's strongest )Tj
T*(admirers. Donald Tovey viewed it as "one of the immeasurably great things in )Tj
T*(music", with power "identical with Shakespeare's",[124] while Kennedy )Tj
T*(criticises the work for "too frequent reliance on sequences" and an )Tj
T*(over-idealised depiction of the female characters.[125] Reed thought that the )Tj
T*(principal themes show less distinction than some of Elgar's earlier works.[126] )Tj
T*(Elgar himself thought Falstaff the highest point of his purely orchestral )Tj
T*(work.[127] )Tj
T*( The major works for voices and orchestra of the twenty-one years of Elgar's )Tj
T*(middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: )Tj
T*(The Dream of Gerontius \(1900\), and the oratorios The Apostles \(1903\) and The )Tj
T*(Kingdom \(1906\); and two shorter odes, the Coronation Ode \(1902\) and The Music )Tj
T*(Makers \(1912\). The first of the odes, as a pi√®ce d'occasion, has rarely been )Tj
T*(revived after its initial success, with the culminating "Land of Hope and )Tj
T*(Glory". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several )Tj
T*(quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in A )Tj
T*(Hero's Life.[128] The choral works were all successful, although the first, )Tj
T*(Gerontius, was and remains the best-loved and most performed.[129] On the )Tj
T*(manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting John Ruskin, "This is the best of me; for the )Tj
T*(rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was )Tj
T*(as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, )Tj
T*(is worth your memory."[2] All three of the large-scale works follow the )Tj
T*(traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together. Elgar's )Tj
T*(distinctive orchestration, as well as his melodic inspiration, lifts them to a )Tj
T*(higher level than most of their British predecessors.[130] )Tj
T*( Elgar's other works of his middle period include incidental music for Grania )Tj
T*(and Diarmid, a play by George Moore and W. B. Yeats \(1901\), and for The )Tj
T*(Starlight Express, a play based on a story by Algernon Blackwood \(1916\). Of the )Tj
T*(former, Yeats called Elgar's music "wonderful in its heroic melancholy".[131] )Tj
T*(Elgar also wrote a number of songs during his peak period, of which Reed )Tj
T*(observes, "it cannot be said that he enriched the vocal repertory to the same )Tj
T*(extent as he did that of the orchestra."[115] )Tj
T*( Final years and posthumous completions )Tj
T*( After the Cello Concerto, Elgar completed no more large-scale works. He made )Tj
T*(arrangements of works by Bach, Handel and Chopin, in distinctively Elgarian )Tj
T*(orchestration,[2] and once again turned his youthful notebooks to use for the )Tj
T*(Nursery Suite \(1931\). His other compositions of this period have not held a )Tj
T*(place in the regular repertory.[1] For most of the rest of the twentieth )Tj
T*(century, it was generally agreed that Elgar's creative impulse ceased after his )Tj
T*(wife's death. Anthony Payne's elaboration of the sketches for Elgar's Third )Tj
T*(Symphony led to a reconsideration of this supposition. Elgar left the opening )Tj
T*(of the symphony complete in full score, and those pages, along with others, )Tj
T*(show Elgar's orchestration changed markedly from the richness of his pre-war )Tj
T*(work. The Gramophone described the opening of the new work as something )Tj
T*("thrilling ... unforgettably gaunt".[132] Payne also subsequently produced a )Tj
T*(performing version of the sketches for a sixth Pomp and Circumstance March, )Tj
T*(premiered at the Proms in August 2006.[133] Elgar's sketches for a piano )Tj

T*(concerto dating from 1913 were elaborated by the composer Robert Walker and )Tj
T*(first performed in August 1997 by the pianist David Owen Norris. The )Tj
T*(realisation has since been extensively revised.[134] )Tj
T*( Reputation )Tj
T*( Views of Elgar's stature have varied in the decades since his music came to )Tj
T*(prominence at the beginning of the twentieth century. Richard Strauss, as )Tj
T*(noted, hailed Elgar as a progressive composer; even the hostile reviewer in The )Tj
T*(Observer, unimpressed by the thematic material of the First Symphony in 1908, )Tj
T*(called the orchestration "magnificently modern".[135] Hans Richter rated Elgar )Tj
T*(as "the greatest modern composer" in any country, and Richter's colleague )Tj
T*(Arthur Nikisch considered the First Symphony "a masterpiece of the first order" )Tj
T*(to be "justly ranked with the great symphonic models ‚Äì Beethoven and )Tj
T*(Brahms."[40] By contrast, the critic W. J. Turner, in the mid-twentieth )Tj
T*(century, wrote of Elgar's "Salvation Army symphonies,"[113] and Herbert von )Tj
T*(Karajan called the Enigma Variations "second-hand Brahms".[136] Elgar's immense )Tj
T*(popularity was not long-lived. After the success of his First Symphony and )Tj
T*(Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received )Tj
T*(but without the earlier wild enthusiasm. His music was identified in the public )Tj
T*(mind with the Edwardian era, and after the First World War he no longer seemed )Tj
T*(a progressive or modern composer. In the early 1920s, even the First Symphony )Tj
T*(had only one London performance in more than three years.[1]Henry Wood and )Tj
T*(younger conductors such as Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli championed Elgar's )Tj
T*(music, but in the recording catalogues and the concert programmes of the middle )Tj
T*(of the century his works were not well represented.[2][137] )Tj
T*( In 1924, the music scholar Edward J. Dent wrote an article for a German music )Tj
T*(journal in which he identified four features of Elgar's style that gave offence )Tj
T*(to a section of English opinion \(namely, Dent indicated, the academic and )Tj
T*(snobbish section\): "too emotional", "not quite free from vulgarity", "pompous", )Tj
T*(and "too deliberately noble in expression".[138] This article was reprinted in )Tj
T*(1930 and caused controversy.[139] In the later years of the century there was, )Tj
T*(in Britain at least, a revival of interest in Elgar's music. The features that )Tj
T*(had offended austere taste in the inter-war years were seen from a different )Tj
T*(perspective. In 1955, the reference book The Record Guide wrote of the )Tj
T*(Edwardian background during the height of Elgar's career: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Boastful self-confidence, emotional vulgarity, material extravagance, a )Tj
T*(ruthless philistinism expressed in tasteless architecture and every kind of )Tj
T*(expensive yet hideous accessory: such features of a late phase of Imperial )Tj
T*(England are faithfully reflected in Elgar's larger works and are apt to prove )Tj
T*(indigestible today. But if it is difficult to overlook the bombastic, the )Tj
T*(sentimental, and the trivial elements in his music, the effort to do so should )Tj
T*(nevertheless be made, for the sake of the many inspired pages, the power and )Tj
T*(eloquence and lofty pathos, of Elgar's best work. ... Anyone who doubts the )Tj
T*(fact of Elgar's genius should take the first opportunity of hearing The Dream )Tj
T*(of Gerontius, which remains his masterpiece, as it is his largest and perhaps )Tj
T*(most deeply felt work; the symphonic study, Falstaff; the Introduction and )Tj
T*(Allegro for Strings; the Enigma Variations; and the Violoncello Concerto.[137])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( By the 1960s, a less severe view was being taken of the Edwardian era. In 1966 )Tj
T*(the critic Frank Howes wrote that Elgar reflected the last blaze of opulence, )Tj
T*(expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In )Tj
T*(Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, )Tj
T*(but "a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work. ... )Tj
T*(Elgar is historically important for giving to English music a sense of the )Tj
T*(orchestra, for expressing what it felt like to be alive in the Edwardian age, )Tj
T*(for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for )Tj
T*(thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations."[138] )Tj
T*( In 1967 the critic and analyst David Cox considered the question of the )Tj
T*(supposed Englishness of Elgar's music. Cox noted that Elgar disliked folk-songs )Tj
T*(and never used them in his works, opting for an idiom that was essentially )Tj

T*(German, leavened by a lightness derived from French composers including Berlioz )Tj
T*(and Gounod. How then, asked Cox, could Elgar be "the most English of )Tj
T*(composers"? Cox found the answer in Elgar's own personality, which "could use )Tj
T*(the alien idioms in such a way as to make of them a vital form of expression )Tj
T*(that was his and his alone. And the personality that comes through in the music )Tj
T*(is English."[113] This point about Elgar's transmuting his influences had been )Tj
T*(touched on before. In 1930 The Times wrote, "When Elgar's first symphony came )Tj
T*(out, someone attempted to prove that its main tune on which all depends was )Tj
T*(like the Grail theme in Parsifal. ... but the attempt fell flat because )Tj
T*(everyone else, including those who disliked the tune, had instantly recognized )Tj
T*(it as typically 'Elgarian', while the Grail theme is as typically )Tj
T*(Wagnerian."[140] As for Elgar's "Englishness", his fellow-composers recognised )Tj
T*(it: Richard Strauss and Stravinsky made particular reference to it,[40] and )Tj
T*(Sibelius called him, "the personification of the true English character in )Tj
T*(music ... a noble personality and a born aristocrat".[40] )Tj
T*( Among Elgar's admirers there is disagreement about which of his works are to )Tj
T*(be regarded as masterpieces. The Enigma Variations are generally counted among )Tj
T*(them.[141]The Dream of Gerontius has also been given high praise by )Tj
T*(Elgarians,[142] and the Cello Concerto is similarly rated.[142] Many rate the )Tj
T*(Violin Concerto equally highly, but some do not. Sackville-West omitted it from )Tj
T*(the list of Elgar masterpieces in The Record Guide,[143] and in a long )Tj
T*(analytical article in The Musical Quarterly, Daniel Gregory Mason criticised )Tj
T*(the first movement of the concerto for a "kind of sing-songiness ... as fatal )Tj
T*(to noble rhythm in music as it is in poetry."[70]Falstaff also divides opinion. )Tj
T*(It has never been a great popular favourite,[144] and Kennedy and Reed identify )Tj
T*(shortcomings in it.[145] In a Musical Times 1957 centenary symposium on Elgar )Tj
T*(led by Vaughan Williams, by contrast, several contributors share Eric Blom's )Tj
T*(view that Falstaff is the greatest of all Elgar's works.[146] )Tj
T*( The two symphonies divide opinion even more sharply. Mason rates the Second )Tj
T*(poorly for its "over-obvious rhythmic scheme", but calls the First "Elgar's )Tj
T*(masterpiece. ... It is hard to see how any candid student can deny the )Tj
T*(greatness of this symphony."[70] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, )Tj
T*(several leading admirers of Elgar express reservations about one or both )Tj
T*(symphonies.[146] In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, "For )Tj
T*(some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has )Tj
T*(its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival )Tj
T*(work."[147] The critic John Warrack wrote, "There are no sadder pages in )Tj
T*(symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and )Tj
T*(trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief",[148] whereas to Michael )Tj
T*(Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst )Tj
T*(and is marked instead by a "benevolent tranquillity."[149] )Tj
T*( Despite the fluctuating critical assessment of the various works over the )Tj
T*(years, Elgar's major works taken as a whole have in the twenty-first century )Tj
T*(recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. The Record Guide in 1955 )Tj
T*(could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none )Tj
T*(of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of )Tj
T*(the Enigma Variations, one of Falstaff, and none of The Dream of Gerontius. )Tj
T*(Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More )Tj
T*(than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for )Tj
T*(example, and more than a dozen of The Dream of Gerontius.[150] Similarly, in )Tj
T*(the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again )Tj
T*(frequently programmed. The Elgar Society's website, in its diary of forthcoming )Tj
T*(performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and )Tj
T*(conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.[151] )Tj
T*( Honours, awards and commemorations )Tj
T*( Elgar was knighted in 1904, and in 1911 he was appointed a member of the Order )Tj
T*(of Merit. In 1920 he received the Cross of Commander of the Belgian Order of )Tj
T*(the Crown; in 1924 he was made Master of the King's Musick; the following year )Tj

T*( ^ His siblings were Henry John \("Harry"; 1848‚Äì64\), Lucy Ann \("Loo"\) \(born )Tj

T*(Francis Thomas \("Frank"; born 1861\), and Helen Agnes \("Dott" or "Dot"; born )Tj
T*(1864\).[3])Tj
T*(^ William Elgar was evidently sceptical of any branch of the church: he wrote )Tj
T*(of "the absurd superstition and play-house mummery of the Papist; the cold and )Tj
T*(formal ceremonies of the Church of England; or the bigotry and rank hypocrisy )Tj
T*(of the Wesleyan."[4])Tj
T*(^ Elgar himself later said, "There is music in the air, music all around us, )Tj
T*(the world is full of it and you simply take as much as you require",[8] and )Tj
T*("The trees are singing my music ‚Äì or have I sung theirs?"[9])Tj
T*(^ It is spelt "Littleton" by all the Elgar authorities cited; however, some )Tj
T*(current sources, for example English Heritage, spell it "Lyttleton".)Tj
T*(^ A profile in The Musical Times reported that Elgar "read a great deal at this )Tj
T*(formulative period of his life. ... In this way he made the acquaintance of Sir )Tj
T*(Philip Sidney's Arcadia, Richard Baker's Chronicles, Michael Drayton's )Tj
T*(Polyolbion", and the works of Voltaire."[12])Tj
T*(^ Kennedy \(ODNB\) mentions the 'Romanza' variation \(no. 13\) in the Enigma )Tj
T*(Variations and the Violin Concerto as possible examples, the former being )Tj
T*(headed "****" and the latter being inscribed as enshrining an unnamed soul.)Tj
T*(^ When Elgar was knighted in 1904, his daughter Carice said, "I am so glad for )Tj
T*(Mother's sake that Father has been knighted. You see ‚Äì it puts her back where )Tj
T*(she was".[23])Tj
T*(^ Salut d'Amour became one of Elgar's best-selling works, but initially he )Tj
T*(earned no royalties, having sold the copyright to the publisher Schott for a )Tj
T*(flat fee of 2 guineas; Schott later decided to pay him royalties.[1][2])Tj
T*(^ Sullivan said to Elgar, "But, my dear boy, I hadn't the slightest idea of it )Tj
T*(‚Äì why on earth didn't you come and tell me? I'd have rehearsed it myself for )Tj
T*(you".[27])Tj
T*(^ Elgar, in recommending Coleridge-Taylor for a commission from the festival, )Tj
T*(said, "He is far and away the cleverest fellow going among the young men."[30])Tj
T*(^ It is not known whether Elgar meant a musical theme or a more general )Tj
T*(non-musical theme such as that of friendship. Many attempts have been made to )Tj
T*(find well-known tunes that can be played in counterpoint with Elgar's main )Tj
T*(musical theme of the piece, from Auld Lang Syne to a theme from Mozart's Prague )Tj
T*(Symphony.[34])Tj
T*(^ For example, according to the Elgar Society's website, in April and May 2010, )Tj
T*(the Variations were programmed in New Orleans, New York, Vancouver, Denver, )Tj
T*(Moscow, Washington D.C. and Krak√≥w.)Tj
T*(^ Strauss and Elgar remained on friendly terms for the rest of Elgar's life, )Tj
T*(and Strauss paid him a warm obituary tribute in 1934.[40])Tj
T*(^ Elgar's principal target was J.A. Fuller Maitland, music critic of The Times, )Tj
T*(whose patronising obituary of Arthur Sullivan repelled Elgar;[59] in his )Tj
T*(Birmingham lectures he alluded to it as "the shady side of musical criticism )Tj

T*( George Percy Aldridge Grainger \(8 July 1882¬†‚Äì 20 February 1961\), known as )Tj
T*(Percy Grainger, was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist. In the )Tj
T*(course of a long and innovative career he played a prominent role in the )Tj
T*(revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th )Tj
T*(century. He also made many adaptations of other composers' works. Although much )Tj
T*(of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most )Tj
T*(generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune "Country )Tj
T*(Gardens". )Tj
T*( Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in )Tj
T*(Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established )Tj
T*(himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer )Tj
T*(and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of )Tj
T*(the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with )Tj
T*(Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and )Tj
T*(culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters. )Tj
T*( In 1914 Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of )Tj
T*(his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australasia. He served )Tj
T*(briefly as a bandsman in the US Army during 1917‚Äì18, and took US citizenship in )Tj
T*(1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922 he became increasingly involved in )Tj
T*(educational work. He also experimented with music machines that he hoped would )Tj
T*(supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in )Tj
T*(Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works and as a future )Tj
T*(research archive. As he grew older he continued to give concerts and to revise )Tj
T*(and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the )Tj
T*(Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity, and he considered )Tj
T*(his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before )Tj
T*(his death. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( [edit] Family background )Tj
T*( Percy Grainger's father, John Grainger \(1854‚Äì1917\),[n 1] was a British-born )Tj
T*(architect who emigrated to Australia in 1877. He won professional recognition )Tj
T*(for his design of the Princes Bridge across the Yarra River in Melbourne.[2] In )Tj
T*(October 1880 he married Rose Annie Aldridge, daughter of Adelaide hotelier )Tj
T*(George Aldridge; the couple settled in New St, Brighton, a suburb of Melbourne, )Tj
T*(where their only son, christened George Percy Grainger, was born on 8 July )Tj
T*(1882.[3] The Grainger house at 305 New St, Brighton has recently been )Tj
T*(redeveloped, with the original structure intact. )Tj
T*( John Grainger was an accomplished artist, with broad cultural interests and a )Tj
T*(wide circle of friends.[4] These included David Mitchell, whose daughter Helen )Tj
T*(later gained worldwide fame as an operatic soprano under the name Nellie Melba. )Tj
T*(John's claims to have "discovered" her are unfounded, although he may have )Tj
T*(offered her encouragement.[5] John was a heavy drinker and a womaniser who, )Tj
T*(Rose learned after the marriage, had fathered a child in England before coming )Tj
T*(to Australia. His promiscuous lifestyle placed heavy strains upon the )Tj
T*(relationship, particularly when Rose discovered shortly after Percy's birth )Tj
T*(that she had contracted a form of syphilis from her husband.[3][4] Despite )Tj
T*(this, the Graingers stayed together until 1890, when John went to England for )Tj
T*(medical treatment. After his return to Australia they lived apart; the burden )Tj

T*(of raising Percy fell to Rose,[6] while John pursued his career as chief )Tj
T*(architect to the Western Australian Department of Public Works. He also )Tj
T*(designed Nellie Melba's home, Coombe Cottage, at Coldstream.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Childhood )Tj
T*( Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he )Tj
T*(was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.[4] )Tj
T*(Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and )Tj
T*(literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From )Tj
T*(his earliest lessons Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic )Tj
T*(culture; writing late in life he maintained that the Icelandic "Saga of Grettir )Tj
T*(the Strong" was "the strongest single artistic influence on my life".[7][8][9] )Tj
T*(As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early )Tj
T*(gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie )Tj
T*(in art rather than music.[10] At the age of 10 he began studying piano under )Tj
T*(Louis Pabst, a German emigr√© then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano )Tj
T*(teacher. Grainger's first known composition, "A Birthday Gift to Mother", is )Tj
T*(dated 1893.[2] Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at )Tj
T*(Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by )Tj
T*(Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the )Tj
T*(Melbourne press.[11] )Tj
T*( After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano )Tj
T*(tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts )Tj
T*(in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this )Tj
T*(enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance )Tj
T*(delighted the Melbourne critics who dubbed him "the flaxen-haired phenomenon )Tj
T*(who plays like a master".[12] This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that )Tj
T*(her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt am )Tj
T*(Main, Germany ‚Äì she had been recommended to this institution by William Laver, )Tj
T*(head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial )Tj
T*(assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and )Tj
T*(a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for )Tj
T*(Europe on 29 May 1895.[13] Although he never returned permanently to Australia, )Tj
T*(Grainger maintained considerable patriotic feelings for his native land,[14] )Tj
T*(and was proud of his Australian heritage.[2] )Tj
T*( [edit] Frankfurt )Tj
T*( In Frankfurt, Rose established herself as a teacher of English; her earnings )Tj
T*(were supplemented by contributions from John Grainger, who had settled in )Tj
T*(Perth. The Hoch Conservatory's reputation for piano teaching had been enhanced )Tj
T*(by the tenure, until 1892, of Clara Schumann as head of piano studies. )Tj
T*(Grainger's piano tutor was James Kwast, who developed his young pupil's skills )Tj
T*(to the extent that, within a year, Grainger was being lauded as a prodigy.[15] )Tj
T*(Grainger had difficult relations with his original composition teacher, Iwan )Tj
T*(Knorr;[4] he withdrew from Knorr's classes to study composition privately with )Tj
T*(an amateur composer and folk-music enthusiast, Karl Klimsch, whom he would )Tj
T*(later honour as "my only composition teacher".[2] )Tj
T*( Together with a group of slightly older British students ‚Äì Roger Quilter, )Tj
T*(Balfour Gardiner, Cyril Scott and Norman O'Neill, all of whom became his )Tj
T*(friends ‚Äì Grainger helped form the "Frankfurt Group", whose long-term objective )Tj
T*(was to rescue British and Scandinavian music from what they considered the )Tj
T*(negative influences of central European music.[4] Encouraged by Klimsch, )Tj
T*(Grainger turned away from composing classical pastiches reminiscent of Handel, )Tj
T*(Haydn and Mozart,[16] and developed a personal compositional style the )Tj
T*(originality and maturity of which quickly impressed and astonished his )Tj
T*(friends.[14] At this time Grainger discovered the poetry of Rudyard Kipling and )Tj
T*(began setting it to music; according to Scott, "No poet and composer have been )Tj
T*(so suitably wedded since Heine &amp; Schumann".[14] )Tj
T*( After accompanying her son on an extended European tour in the summer of 1900 )Tj
T*(Rose, whose health had been poor for some time, suffered a nervous collapse and )Tj
T*(could no longer work.[17] To replace lost income Grainger began giving piano )Tj
T*(lessons and public performances; his first solo recital was in Frankfurt on 6 )Tj

T*(December 1900.[2] Meanwhile he continued his studies with Kwast, and increased )Tj
T*(his repertoire until he was confident he could maintain himself and his mother )Tj
T*(as a concert pianist. Having chosen London as his future base, in May 1901 )Tj
T*(Grainger abandoned his studies and, with Rose, left Frankfurt for England.[17] )Tj
T*( Before leaving Frankfurt, Grainger had fallen in love with Kwast's daughter )Tj
T*(Mimi;[17] in an autobiographical essay dated 1947 he admits to being "already )Tj
T*(sex-crazy" at this time.[18] \(Mimi Kwast, who was the grand-daughter of )Tj
T*(Ferdinand Hiller, married another of her father's pupils, Hans Pfitzner.\) John )Tj
T*(Bird, Grainger's biographer, also records that during his Frankfurt years )Tj
T*(Grainger began to develop sexual appetites that were "distinctly abnormal"; by )Tj
T*(the age of 16 he had started to experiment in flagellation and other )Tj
T*(sado-masochistic practices, which he continued to pursue through most of his )Tj
T*(adult life. Bird surmises that Grainger's fascination with themes of punishment )Tj
T*(and pain derived from the harsh discipline to which Rose had subjected him as a )Tj
T*(child.[18] )Tj
T*( [edit] London years )Tj
T*( [edit] Concert pianist )Tj
T*( In London, Grainger's charm, good looks and talent \(with some assistance from )Tj
T*(the local Australian community\) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a )Tj
T*(pianist by wealthy patrons, and was soon performing in concerts in private )Tj
T*(homes. The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger's )Tj
T*(playing "revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight".[19] )Tj
T*(In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, )Tj
T*(who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals.[20] Lowrey, 20 years )Tj
T*(Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours ‚Äì he termed )Tj
T*(the relationship a "love-serve job".[8] She was the first woman with whom he )Tj
T*(had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced "an )Tj
T*(overpowering landslide" of feeling, and that "I thought I was about to die. If )Tj
T*(I remember correctly, I only experienced fear of death. I don't think that any )Tj
T*(joy entered into it".[21] )Tj
T*( In February 1902 Grainger made his first appearance as a piano soloist with an )Tj
T*(orchestra, playing Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto with the Bath Pump Room )Tj
T*(Orchestra. In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with )Tj
T*(Adelina Patti, the Italian-born opera singer. Patti was greatly taken by the )Tj
T*(young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him.[22] The following year )Tj
T*(he met the German-Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni. Initially the )Tj
T*(two men were on cordial terms \(Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of )Tj
T*(charge\) and as a result, Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as )Tj
T*(Busoni's pupil.[2] However, the visit was not a success; as Bird notes, Busoni )Tj
T*(had expected "a willing slave and adoring disciple", a role Grainger was not )Tj
T*(willing to fulfil.[23] Grainger returned to London in July 1903; almost )Tj
T*(immediately he departed with Rose on a 10-month tour of Australia, New Zealand )Tj
T*(and South Africa, as a member of a party organised by the Australian contralto )Tj
T*(Ada Crossley.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Emergent composer )Tj
T*( Before going to London Grainger had composed numerous Kipling settings, and )Tj
T*(his first mature orchestral pieces.[25] In London, when he found time he )Tj
T*(continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates )Tj
T*(that he was working on his Marching Song of Democracy \(a Walt Whitman setting\), )Tj
T*(and had made good progress with the experimental works Train Music and Charging )Tj
T*(Irishrey.[26] In his early London years he also composed Hill Song Number 1 )Tj
T*(\(1902\), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.[25][27] )Tj
T*( In 1905, inspired by a lecture given by the pioneer folksong historian Lucy )Tj
T*(Broadwood, Grainger began to collect original folksongs. Starting at Brigg in )Tj
T*(Lincolnshire, over the next five years he gathered and transcribed more than )Tj
T*(300 songs from all over the country, including much material that had never )Tj
T*(been written down before. From 1906 Grainger used a phonograph, one of the )Tj
T*(first collectors to do so, and by this means he assembled more than 200 Edison )Tj
T*(cylinder recordings of native folk singers.[28][29] These activities coincided )Tj
T*(with what Bird calls "the halcyon days of the 'First English Folksong )Tj

T*(Revival'".[30] )Tj
T*( As his stature in the music world increased, Grainger became acquainted with )Tj
T*(many of its leading figures, including Vaughan Williams, Elgar, Richard Strauss )Tj
T*(and Debussy.[28] In 1907 he met Frederick Delius, with whom he achieved an )Tj
T*(immediate rapport ‚Äì the two musicians had similar ideas about composition and )Tj
T*(harmony, and shared a dislike for the classical German masters.[31] Both were )Tj
T*(inspired by folk music;[32] Grainger gave Delius his setting of the folksong )Tj
T*(Brigg Fair, which the older composer developed into his famous orchestral )Tj
T*(rhapsody, dedicated to Grainger.[31] The two remained close friends until )Tj
T*(Delius's death in 1934.[33] )Tj
T*( Grainger first met Grieg at the home of the London financier Sir Edgar Speyer, )Tj
T*(in May 1906.[34] As a student Grainger had learned to appreciate the )Tj
T*(Norwegian's harmonic originality, and by 1906 had several Grieg pieces in his )Tj
T*(concert repertoire, including the piano concerto.[35] Grieg was greatly )Tj
T*(impressed with Grainger's playing, and wrote that the Australian was "a genius )Tj
T*(that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love."[36] Through 1906‚Äì7 the two )Tj
T*(maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence, which culminated in )Tj
T*(Grainger's ten-day visit in July 1907 to the composer's Norwegian home, )Tj
T*("Troldhaugen" near Bergen. Here the two spent much time revising and rehearsing )Tj
T*(the piano concerto in preparation for that year's Leeds Festival. Their plans )Tj
T*(for a long-term working relationship were thwarted by Grieg's sudden death in )Tj
T*(September 1907; this relatively brief acquaintance had a considerable impact on )Tj
T*(Grainger, and he championed Grieg's music for the rest of his life.[35] )Tj
T*( After fulfilling a hectic schedule of concert engagements in Britain and )Tj
T*(continental Europe, in August 1908 Grainger accompanied Ada Crossley on a )Tj
T*(second Australasian tour, during which he added several cylinders of Maori and )Tj
T*(Polynesian music to his collection of recordings.[28] He had resolved to )Tj
T*(establish himself as a top-ranking pianist before promoting himself as a )Tj

T*(settings. Some of his most successful and most characteristic pieces, such as )Tj
T*("Mock Morris", "Handel in the Strand", "Shepherd's Hey" and "Molly on the )Tj
T*(Shore" date from this period. In 1908 he obtained the tune of "Country Gardens" )Tj
T*(from the folk music specialist Cecil Sharp, though he did not fashion it into a )Tj
T*(performable piece for another ten years.[37][38] In 1911 Grainger finally felt )Tj
T*(confident enough of his standing as a pianist to begin large-scale publishing )Tj
T*(of his compositions, at the same time adopting the professional name of "Percy )Tj
T*(Aldridge Grainger".[8][39] )Tj
T*( In a series of concerts arranged by Balfour Gardiner at London's Queen's Hall )Tj
T*(in March 1912, five of Grainger's works were performed to great public acclaim; )Tj
T*(the band of thirty guitars and mandolins for the performance of "Fathers and )Tj
T*(Daughters" created a particular impression.[40] On 21 May 1912 Grainger )Tj
T*(presented the first concert devoted entirely to his own compositions, at the )Tj
T*(Aeolian Hall, London;[9] the concert was, he reported, "a sensational )Tj
T*(success".[41] A similarly enthusiastic reception was given to Grainger's music )Tj
T*(at a second series of Gardiner concerts the following year.[42] )Tj
T*( In 1905 Grainger began a close friendship with Karen Holten, a Danish music )Tj
T*(student who had been recommended to him as a piano pupil. She became an )Tj
T*(important confidante; the relationship persisted for eight years, largely )Tj
T*(through correspondence.[43][n 2] After her marriage in 1916 she and Grainger )Tj
T*(continued to correspond and occasionally meet until her death in 1953. Grainger )Tj
T*(was briefly engaged in 1913 to another pupil, Margot Harrison, but the )Tj

T*(orchestras were adding his works to their repertoires.[45] His decision to )Tj
T*(leave England for America in early September 1914, after the outbreak of the )Tj
T*(First World War, damaged his reputation among his patriotically minded British )Tj
T*(friends.[2] Grainger wrote that the reason for this abrupt departure was "to )Tj
T*(give mother a change".[48] However, according to Bird, Grainger often explained )Tj
T*(that his reason for leaving London was that "he wanted to emerge as Australia's )Tj
T*(first composer of worth, and to have laid himself open to the possibility of )Tj
T*(being killed would have rendered his goal unattainable".[49]The Daily Telegraph )Tj
T*(music critic Robin Legge accused him of cowardice, and told him not to expect a )Tj
T*(welcome in England after the war,[8] words that hurt Grainger deeply.[50] )Tj
T*( Grainger's first American tour began on 11 February 1915 with a recital at New )Tj
T*(York's Aeolian Hall. He played works by Bach, Brahms, Handel and Chopin )Tj
T*(alongside two of his own compositions: "Colonial Song" and "Mock Morris". In )Tj
T*(July 1915 Grainger had formally registered his intention to apply for US )Tj
T*(citizenship.[51] Over the next two years his engagements included concerts with )Tj
T*(Nellie Melba in Boston and Pittsburgh and a command performance before )Tj
T*(President Woodrow Wilson. In addition to his concert performances, Grainger )Tj
T*(secured a contract with the Duo-Art Company for making pianola rolls, and )Tj
T*(signed a recording contract with Columbia.[9] )Tj
T*( In April 1917 Grainger received news of John Grainger's death in Perth.[52] On )Tj
T*(9 June 1917, after America's entry into the war, he enlisted as a bandsman in )Tj
T*(the Coast Artillery Corps of the US Army. He had joined as a saxophonist,[n 3] )Tj
T*(though he records learning the oboe: "I long for the time when I can blow my )Tj
T*(oboe well enough to play in the band".[55] In his 18 months' service, Grainger )Tj
T*(made frequent appearances as a pianist at Red Cross and Liberty bond concerts. )Tj
T*(As a regular encore he began to play a piano setting of the tune "Country )Tj
T*(Gardens". The piece became instantly popular; sheet music sales quickly broke )Tj
T*(many publishing records.[56] The work was to become synonymous with Grainger's )Tj
T*(name through the rest of his life, though he came in time to detest it.[57] On )Tj
T*(3 June 1918 he became a naturalised American citizen.[58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career zenith )Tj
T*( After leaving the army in January 1919, Grainger refused an offer to become )Tj
T*(conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and resumed his career as a )Tj
T*(concert pianist.[59] He was soon performing around 120 concerts a year,[60] )Tj
T*(generally to great critical acclaim, and in April 1921 reached a wider audience )Tj
T*(by performing in a cinema, New York's Capitol Theatre. Grainger commented that )Tj
T*(the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation )Tj
T*(for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall )Tj
T*(and the Aeolian.[61] In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique )Tj
T*(at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would )Tj
T*(undertake in later years.[62][63] )Tj
T*( Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to rescore many of )Tj
T*(his works \(a habit he continued throughout his life\) and also to compose new )Tj
T*(pieces: his Children's March: Over the Hills and Far Away, and the orchestral )Tj
T*(version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this )Tj
T*(period.[64] His close friend Ralph Leopold, whom he met while in the army, )Tj
T*(participated in the premieres of both versions of the Children's March, and )Tj
T*(also recorded a number of four-hand works with him on piano rolls. He also )Tj
T*(began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible )Tj
T*(orchestration which enabled works to be performed by different numbers of )Tj
T*(players and instrument types, from small chamber groups up to full orchestral )Tj
T*(strength.[65] )Tj
T*( In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, )Tj
T*(New York. This was his home for the remainder of his life.[8] From the )Tj
T*(beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from )Tj
T*(delusions and nightmares, and became fearful that her illness would harm her )Tj
T*(son's career.[66] Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there )Tj
T*(had long been rumours that their relationship was incestuous;[57] in April 1922 )Tj

T*(confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the )Tj
T*(West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window on the 18th floor of )Tj
T*(the Aeolian Building in New York City.[68] The letter, which began "I am out of )Tj
T*(my mind and cannot think properly", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to )Tj
T*(Lotta of "improper love". She signed the letter: "Your poor insane mother".[69] )Tj
T*( [edit] Inter-war years )Tj
T*( [edit] Traveller )Tj
T*( After Rose's funeral, Grainger sought solace in a return to work. In autumn )Tj
T*(1922 he left for a year-long trip to Europe, where he collected and recorded )Tj
T*(Danish folksongs before a concert tour that took him to Norway, Holland, )Tj
T*(Germany and England. In Norway he stayed with Delius at the latter's summer )Tj
T*(home. Delius was by now almost blind; Grainger helped fulfil his friend's wish )Tj
T*(to see a Norwegian sunset by carrying him \(with some assistance\) to the top of )Tj
T*(a nearby mountain peak.[70] He returned to White Plains in August 1923.[71] )Tj
T*( Although now less committed to a year-round schedule of concerts, Grainger )Tj
T*(remained a very popular performer. His eccentricities, often exaggerated for )Tj
T*(publicity reasons, reportedly included running into auditoriums in gym kit and )Tj
T*(leaping over the grand piano to create a grand entrance.[72] While he continued )Tj
T*(to revise and rescore his compositions, he increasingly worked on arrangements )Tj
T*(of music by other composers,[73] in particular works by Bach, Brahms, Faur√© and )Tj
T*(Delius.[74] Away from music, Grainger's preoccupation with Nordic culture led )Tj
T*(him to develop a form of English which, he maintained, reflected the character )Tj
T*(of the language before the Norman conquest. Words of Norman or Latin origin )Tj
T*(were replaced by supposedly Nordic word-forms, such as "blend-band" )Tj
T*(\(orchestra\), "forthspeaker" \(lecturer\) and "writ-piece" \(article\). He called )Tj
T*(this "blue-eyed" English.[75] His convictions of Nordic superiority eventually )Tj
T*(led Grainger, in letters to friends, to express his views in crudely racial and )Tj
T*(anti-Semitic terms; the music historian David Pear describes Grainger as, "at )Tj
T*(root, a racial bigot of no small order".[76][n 4] )Tj
T*( Grainger made further trips to Europe in 1925 and 1927, collecting more Danish )Tj
T*(folk music with the aid of the octogenarian ethnologist Evald Tang Kristensen; )Tj
T*(this work formed the basis of the Suite on Danish Folksongs of 1928‚Äì30.[9] He )Tj
T*(also visited Australia and New Zealand, in 1924 and again in 1926. In November )Tj
T*(1926, while returning to America, he met Ella Str√∂m, a Swedish-born artist with )Tj
T*(whom he developed a close friendship. On arrival in America the pair separated, )Tj
T*(but were reunited in England the following autumn after Grainger's final )Tj
T*(folksong expedition to Denmark. In October 1927 the couple agreed to marry.[80] )Tj
T*(Ella had a daughter, Elsie, who had been born out of wedlock in 1909. Grainger )Tj
T*(always acknowledged her as a family member, and developed a warm personal )Tj
T*(relationship with her.[81] )Tj
T*( Although Bird asserts that before her marriage, Ella knew nothing of )Tj
T*(Grainger's sado-masochistic interests,[82] in a letter dated 23 April 1928 )Tj
T*(\(four months before the wedding\) Grainger writes to her: "As far as my taste )Tj
T*(goes, blows [with the whip] are most thrilling on breasts, bottom, inner )Tj
T*(thighs, sexparts". He later adds, "I shall thoroly thoroly [sic] understand if )Tj
T*(you cannot in any way see yr way to follow up this hot wish of mine".[83] The )Tj
T*(couple were married on 9 August 1928 at the Hollywood Bowl, at the end of a )Tj
T*(concert which, in honour of the bride, had included the first performance of )Tj
T*(Grainger's bridal song "To a Nordic Princess".[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Educator )Tj
T*( From the late 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became involved increasingly with )Tj

T*(ideas. Despite many offers he never accepted another formal academic )Tj
T*(appointment, and refused all offers of honorary degrees.[84][n 5] His New York )Tj
T*(lectures became the basis for a series of radio talks which he gave for the )Tj
T*(Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1934‚Äì35; these were later summarised and )Tj
T*(published as Music: A Commonsense View of All Types.[2] On 3 and 4 September )Tj
T*(1934 Grainger adjudicated at the Sydney Eisteddfod on Sections 10 \(Vocal )Tj
T*(Ensemble\) and 45 \(String Ensemble\) for which he selected and provided the )Tj
T*(music. In 1937 Grainger began an association with the Interlochen International )Tj
T*(Music Camp, and taught regularly at its summer schools until 1944.[86] )Tj
T*( [edit] Innovator )Tj
T*( The idea of establishing a Grainger Museum in Australia had first occurred to )Tj
T*(Grainger in 1932. He began collecting and recovering from friends letters and )Tj
T*(artifacts, even those demonstrating the most private aspects of his life,[87] )Tj
T*(such as whips, bloodstained shirts and revealing photographs.[88] In September )Tj
T*(1933 he and Ella went to Australia to begin supervising the building work. To )Tj
T*(finance the project, Grainger embarked on a series of concerts and )Tj
T*(broadcasts,[89] in which he subjected his audiences to a vast range of the )Tj
T*(world's music in accordance with his "universalist" view. Controversially, he )Tj
T*(argued for the superior achievements of Nordic composers over traditionally )Tj
T*(recognised masters such as Mozart and Beethoven.[2] )Tj
T*( Among various new ideas, Grainger introduced his so-called "free-music" )Tj
T*(theories. He believed that conformity with the traditional rules of set scales, )Tj
T*(rhythms and harmonic procedures amounted to "absurd goose-stepping", from which )Tj
T*(music should be set free.[90] He demonstrated two experimental compositions of )Tj
T*(free music, performed initially by a string quartet and later by the use of )Tj
T*(electronic theremins.[8] He believed that ideally, free music required )Tj
T*(non-human performance, and spent much of his later life developing machines to )Tj
T*(fulfil this vision.[91] )Tj
T*( While the building of the museum proceeded, the Graingers visited England for )Tj
T*(several months in 1936, during which Grainger made his first BBC broadcast. In )Tj
T*(this, he conducted "Love Verses from The Song of Solomon" in which the tenor )Tj
T*(soloist was the then unknown Peter Pears.[92] After spending 1937 in America, )Tj
T*(Grainger returned to Melbourne in 1938 for the official opening of the Museum; )Tj
T*(among those present at the ceremony was his old piano teacher Adelaide Burkitt. )Tj
T*(The museum did not open to the general public during Grainger's lifetime, but )Tj
T*(was available to scholars for research.[93][94] )Tj
T*( In the late 1930s Grainger spent much time arranging his works in settings for )Tj
T*(wind bands. He wrote A Lincolnshire Posy for the March 1937 convention of the )Tj
T*(American Band Masters' Association in Milwaukee,[95] and in 1939, on his last )Tj
T*(visit to England before the Second World War, he composed "The Duke of )Tj
T*(Marlborough's Fanfare", giving it the subtitle "British War Mood Grows".[93] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later career )Tj
T*( [edit] Second World War )Tj
T*( The outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 curtailed Grainger's overseas )Tj
T*(travelling. In the autumn of 1940, alarmed that the war might precipitate an )Tj
T*(invasion of the United States eastern seaboard, he and Ella moved to )Tj
T*(Springfield, Missouri, in the centre of the continent.[96] From 1940 Grainger )Tj
T*(played regularly in charity concerts, especially after the attack on Pearl )Tj
T*(Harbor brought the United States into the war in December 1941; the historian )Tj
T*(Robert Simon calculates that Grainger made a total of 274 charity appearances )Tj
T*(during the war years, many of them at Army and Air force camps.[94] In 1942 a )Tj

T*(conducted the premiere of his wind band setting of "The Power of Rome and the )Tj
T*(Christian Heart", written for the Goldman Band to celebrate the 70th birthday )Tj
T*(of its founder. Afterwards, Grainger denigrated his own music as "commonplace" )Tj
T*(while praising Darius Milhaud's Suite Fran√ßaise, with which it had shared the )Tj
T*(programme.[99] )Tj
T*( On 10 August 1948, Grainger appeared at the London Proms, playing the piano )Tj
T*(part in his Suite on Danish Folksongs with the London Symphony Orchestra under )Tj
T*(Basil Cameron. On 18 September he attended the Last Night of the Proms, )Tj
T*(standing in the promenade section for Delius's Brigg Fair.[100] Over the next )Tj
T*(few years several friends died: Gardiner in 1950, Quilter and Karen Holten in )Tj
T*(1953. In October 1953 Grainger was operated on for abdominal cancer; his fight )Tj
T*(against this disease would last for the rest of his life.[101] He continued to )Tj
T*(appear at concerts, often in church halls and educational establishments rather )Tj
T*(than major concert venues.[9] In 1954, after his last Carnegie Hall appearance, )Tj
T*(Grainger's long promotion of Grieg's music was recognised when he was awarded )Tj
T*(the St. Olav Medal by King Haakon of Norway.[102] However, a growing bitterness )Tj
T*(was becoming evident in his writings and correspondence; in a letter to his )Tj
T*(lifelong friend, the Danish composer Herman Sandby, he bemoaned the continuing )Tj
T*(ascendency in music of the "German form", and asserted that "all my )Tj
T*(compositional life I have been a leader without followers".[102] )Tj
T*( After 1950 Grainger virtually ceased to compose. His principal creative )Tj
T*(activity in the last decade of his life was his work with Burnett Cross, a )Tj
T*(young physics teacher, on free music machines. The first of these was a )Tj
T*(relatively simple device controlled by an adapted pianola.[103] Next was the )Tj
T*("Estey-reed tone-tool", a form of giant harmonica which, Grainger expectantly )Tj
T*(informed his stepdaughter Elsie in April 1951, would be ready to play free )Tj
T*(music "in a few weeks".[104] A third machine, the "Cross-Grainger )Tj
T*(Kangaroo-pouch", was completed by 1952. Developments in transistor technology )Tj
T*(encouraged Grainger and Cross to begin work on a fourth, entirely electronic )Tj
T*(machine, which was incomplete when Grainger died.[8][103] )Tj
T*( In September 1955 Grainger made his final visit to Australia, where he spent )Tj
T*(nine months organising and arranging exhibits for the Grainger Museum. He )Tj
T*(refused to consider a "Grainger Festival", as suggested by the Australian )Tj
T*(Broadcasting Commission, because he felt that his homeland had rejected him and )Tj
T*(his music. Before leaving Melbourne, he deposited in a bank a parcel that )Tj
T*(contained an essay and photographs related to his sex life, not to be opened )Tj
T*(until 10 years after his death.[105] )Tj
T*( [edit] Last years )Tj
T*( By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of )Tj
T*(concentration.[106] Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in )Tj
T*(May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC "Concert )Tj
T*(Hour" programme when he played "Handel in the Strand" on the piano. Back home, )Tj
T*(after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter )Tj
T*(concerts season.[107] On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the )Tj
T*(two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence.[108] )Tj
T*(He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by )Tj
T*(illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing )Tj
T*(his skeleton "for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum". )Tj
T*(This wish was not carried out.[109] )Tj
T*( Through the winter of 1959‚Äì60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, )Tj
T*(often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On )Tj
T*(29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, )Tj
T*(New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On )Tj
T*(this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the )Tj
T*(afternoon was, in his own words, "a fiasco".[110][111] Subsequently confined to )Tj
T*(his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in )Tj
T*(August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril )Tj

T*(not succeeded yet."[113] )Tj
T*( Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of )Tj
T*(78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the )Tj
T*(Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes.[8] )Tj
T*(Ella survived him by 18 years; in 1972, aged 83, she married a young archivist, )Tj
T*(Stewart Manville. She died at White Plains on 17 July 1979.[2][114] )Tj
T*( Grainger's own works fall into two categories: original compositions and folk )Tj
T*(music arrangements. Besides these, he wrote many settings of other composers' )Tj
T*(works.[8][9] Despite his conservatory training he rebelled against the )Tj
T*(disciplines of the central European tradition, largely rejecting conventional )Tj
T*(forms such as symphony, sonata, concerto and opera. With few exceptions his )Tj
T*(original compositions are miniatures, lasting between two and eight minutes. )Tj
T*(Only a few of his works originated as piano pieces, though in due course almost )Tj
T*(all of them were, in his phrase, "dished up" in piano versions.[9] )Tj
T*( The conductor John Eliot Gardiner describes Grainger as "a true original in )Tj
T*(terms of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation", whose terseness of )Tj
T*(expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th century Second Viennese )Tj
T*(School and the Italian madrigalists of the 16th and 17th centuries.[115]Malcolm )Tj
T*(Gillies, a Grainger scholar, writes of Grainger's style that "you know it is )Tj
T*('Grainger' when you have heard about one second of a piece".[116] The music's )Tj
T*(most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its texture ‚Äì "the weft of )Tj
T*(the fabric", according to Grainger.[117] Different textures are defined by )Tj
T*(Grainger as "smooth", "grained" and "prickly".[9] )Tj
T*( Grainger was a musical democrat; he believed that in a performance each )Tj
T*(player's role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was )Tj
T*(developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give )Tj
T*(effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger's )Tj
T*(earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of time signature were )Tj
T*(employed in Love Verses from "The Song of Solomon" \(1899\), and Train Music )Tj
T*(\(1901\), long before Stravinsky adopted this practice.[4] In search of specific )Tj
T*(sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, )Tj
T*(theremins, marimbas, musical glasses, harmoniums, banjos, and )Tj
T*(ukuleles.[109][118] In one early concert of folk music, Quilter and Scott were )Tj
T*(conscripted as performers, to whistle various parts.[119] In "Random Round" )Tj
T*(\(1912‚Äì14\), inspired by the communal music-making he had heard in the Pacific )Tj
T*(Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of )Tj
T*(chance into performances; individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make )Tj
T*(random choices from a menu of variations.[9] This experiment in "aleatory" )Tj
T*(composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by )Tj
T*(avant-garde composers such as Berio and Stockhausen.[120] )Tj
T*( The brief "Sea Song" of 1907 was an early attempt by Grainger to write )Tj
T*("beatless" music. This work, initially set over 14 irregular bars and occupying )Tj
T*(about 15 seconds of performing time,[121] was a forerunner of Grainger's free )Tj
T*(music experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: "It seems to me absurd to live )Tj
T*(in an age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves". )Tj
T*(The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of )Tj
T*(eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. "Out in nature )Tj
T*(we hear all kinds of lovely and touching "free" \(non-harmonic\) combinations of )Tj
T*(tones; yet we are unable to take up these beauties ... into the art of music )Tj
T*(because of our archaic notions of harmony".[90] In a 1941 letter to Scott, )Tj

T*(16 bars of music. By this time, Grainger acknowledged that he had not fulfilled )Tj
T*(Grieg's high expectations of him, either as a composer or as a pianist. He also )Tj
T*(reflected on whether it would have been better, from the point of view of his )Tj
T*(development as a composer, had he never met the Griegs, "sweet and dear though )Tj
T*(they were to me".[123] )Tj
T*( Grainger was known for his musical experimentation and did not hesitate to )Tj
T*(exploit the capabilities of the orchestra. Train Music was intended for 150 )Tj
T*(players and Country Gardens has some lush harmonic invention. Perhaps his most )Tj
T*(ambitious work was The Warriors, an 18 minute 'imaginary ballet' of frenzied )Tj
T*('danceable music', entrusted to a huge orchestral ensemble incorporating a )Tj
T*(large 'tuneful percussion' mixture alongside at least three pianos ‚Äì in one )Tj
T*(performance, Grainger used nineteen pianos with thirty pianists ‚Äì to be played )Tj
T*(by "exceptionally strong vigorous players".[124] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Grainger considered himself an Australian composer who, he said, wrote music )Tj
T*("in the hopes of bringing honor and fame to my native land".[125] However, much )Tj
T*(of Grainger's working life was spent elsewhere, and the extent to which he )Tj
T*(influenced Australian music, within his lifetime and thereafter, is )Tj
T*(debatable.[126] His efforts to educate the Australian musical public in the )Tj
T*(mid-1930s were indifferently received, and did not attract disciples;[127] )Tj
T*(writing in 2010, the academic and critic Roger Covell identifies only one )Tj
T*(significant contemporary Australian musician ‚Äì the English-born horn player, )Tj
T*(pianist and conductor David Stanhope ‚Äì working in the Grainger idiom.[126] In )Tj
T*(1956, the suggestion by the composer Keith Humble that Grainger be invited to )Tj
T*(write music for the opening of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne had been )Tj
T*(rejected by the organisers of the Games.[105] )Tj
T*( Grainger was a life-long atheist and believed he would only endure in the body )Tj
T*(of work he left behind.[128] He took an unusual course of action to ensure that )Tj
T*(survival by establishing a personal museum dedicated to his own life. The )Tj
T*(Grainger Museum was given little attention before the mid-1970s;[9] it was )Tj
T*(initially regarded as evidence either of an over-large ego or of extreme )Tj
T*(eccentricity.[129] Since then the University of Melbourne's commitment to the )Tj
T*(museum has, Covell asserts, "rescued [it] permanently from academic denigration )Tj
T*(and belittlement".[129] Its vast quantities of materials have been used to )Tj
T*(investigate not only Grainger's life and works, but those of contemporaries )Tj
T*(whom Grainger had known: Grieg, Delius, Scott and others.[130] The Grainger )Tj
T*(home at 7 Cromwell Place, White Plains, is now the Percy Grainger Library and )Tj
T*(is a further repository of memorabilia and historic performance material, open )Tj
T*(to researchers and visitors.[9][131] )Tj
T*( In Britain, Grainger's main legacy is the revival of interest in folk music. )Tj
T*(His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folksongs greatly )Tj
T*(influenced the following generation of English composers; Benjamin Britten )Tj
T*(acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect.[132] After hearing a )Tj
T*(broadcast of some Grainger settings, Britten reportedly declared that these )Tj
T*("[knocked] all the Vaughan Williams and R. O. Morris arrangements into a cocked )Tj
T*(hat".[133] In the United States, Grainger left a strong educational legacy )Tj
T*(through his involvement, over 40 years, with high school, summer school and )Tj
T*(college students. Likewise, his innovative approaches to instrumentation and )Tj
T*(scoring have left their mark on modern American band music;[9] Timothy Reynish, )Tj
T*(a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America, has described him )Tj
T*(as "the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal, if not )Tj
T*(the superior, in expressive potential to symphony orchestras."[134] Grainger's )Tj
T*(attempts to produce "free music" by mechanical and later electronic means, )Tj
T*(which he considered his most important work, produced no follow-up; they were )Tj
T*(quickly overtaken and nullified by new technological advances. Covell )Tj
T*(nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour, Grainger's dogged resourcefulness )Tj
T*(and ingenious use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian )Tj
T*(aspect of the composer's character ‚Äì one of which Grainger would have been )Tj
T*(proud.[135] )Tj

T*( In 1945 Grainger devised an informal ratings system for composers and musical )Tj
T*(styles, based on criteria that included originality, complexity and beauty. Of )Tj
T*(forty composers and styles, he ranked himself equal ninth ‚Äì behind Wagner and )Tj
T*(Delius, but well ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky.[123] Nevertheless, in his )Tj
T*(later years he frequently denigrated his career, for example writing to Scott: )Tj
T*("I have never been a true musician or true artist".[136] His failure to be )Tj
T*(recognised as a composer for anything beyond his popular folk-song arrangements )Tj
T*(was a source of frustration and disappointment;[137] for years after his death )Tj
T*(the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed.[138] From the 1990s an )Tj
T*(increase in the number of Grainger recordings has brought a revival of interest )Tj
T*(in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer.[2] An unsigned )Tj
T*(tribute published on the Gramophone website in February 2011 to commemorate the )Tj
T*(50th anniversary of Grainger's death opined that "though he would never be put )Tj
T*(on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and )Tj
T*(deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical )Tj
T*(taste".[109] )Tj
T*( Of Grainger the pianist, The New York Times critic Harold Schonberg wrote that )Tj
T*(his unique style was expressed with "amazing skill, personality and )Tj
T*(vigor".[139] The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances )Tj
T*(became muted in later years, and reviews of his performances during the final )Tj
T*(ten years of his life were often harsh.[140] However, Britten regarded )Tj
T*(Grainger's late recording of the Grieg concerto, from a live performance at )Tj
T*(Aarhus in 1957, as "one of the noblest ever committed to record" ‚Äì despite the )Tj
T*(suppression of the disc for many years, because of the proliferation of wrong )Tj
T*(notes and other faults.[141] Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, referring )Tj
T*(to Grainger's early displays of artistic skills, has speculated that had John )Tj
T*(Grainger's influence not been removed, "Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be )Tj
T*(remembered as one of Australia's leading painters and designers, who just )Tj
T*(happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer".[142] The )Tj
T*(ethnomusicologist John Blacking, while acknowledging Grainger's contribution to )Tj
T*(social and cultural aspects of music, nevertheless writes that if the )Tj
T*(continental foundation of Grainger's musical education had not been "undermined )Tj
T*(by dilettantism and the disastrous influence of his mother, I am sure that his )Tj
T*(ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater".[143] )Tj
T*( [edit] Recordings )Tj
T*( Between 1908 and 1957 Grainger made numerous recordings, usually as pianist or )Tj
T*(conductor, of his own and other composers' music. His first recordings, for The )Tj
T*(Gramophone Company Ltd \(later HMV\), included the cadenza to Grieg's piano )Tj
T*(concerto; he did not record a complete version of this work on disc until 1945. )Tj
T*(Much of his recording work was done between 1917 and 1931, under contract with )Tj
T*(Columbia. At other times he recorded for Decca \(1944‚Äì45 and 1957\), and Vanguard )Tj
T*(\(1957\). Of his own compositions and arrangements, "Country Gardens", )Tj
T*("Shepherd's Hey" and "Molly on the Shore" were recorded most frequently; in )Tj
T*(recordings of other composers, piano works by Bach, Brahms, Chopin, Grieg, )Tj
T*(Liszt and Schumann figure most often.[144] Grainger's complete 78 rpm solo )Tj
T*(piano recordings are now available on compact disc as a CD box set on APR )Tj
T*(records in transfers made by Ward Marston.[145] During his association with the )Tj
T*(Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 piano rolls of )Tj
T*(his own and others' music, many of which have subsequently been transferred to )Tj
T*(CD, using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand piano via an array of )Tj
T*(precision mechanical fingers and feet.[146][147][148] This reproduction system )Tj
T*(allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, )Tj
T*(during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony )Tj
T*(Orchestra in Grieg's Piano Concerto.[149] )Tj
T*( Since Grainger's death, recordings of his works have been undertaken by many )Tj
T*(artists and issued under many different labels. In 1995 Chandos Records began )Tj
T*(to compile a complete recorded edition of Grainger's original compositions and )Tj
T*(folk settings.[150] Of 25 anticipated volumes, 19 had been completed as of )Tj
T*(2010;[151] these were issued as a CD boxed set in 2011, to mark the 50th )Tj
T*(anniversary of the composer's death.[152] )Tj

T*( [edit] Media portrayals )Tj
T*( Percy Grainger has been portrayed on screen more than once. In Song of Summer, )Tj
T*(a 1968 Ken Russell film mainly about Frederick Delius and Eric Fenby, he was )Tj
T*(played by David Collings. Passion \(also known as Passion: The Story of Percy )Tj
T*(Grainger\) was a 1999 Australian biopic about some episodes in Grainger's life )Tj
T*(during the early part of his career. It starred Richard Roxburgh as the )Tj
T*(composer and Barbara Hershey as Rose Grainger. )Tj

T*( Notes )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( ^ Although most sources give 1855 as the birth year, the Grainger Museum )Tj
T*(states that 1854 is the correct year.[1])Tj
T*(^ The correspondence was conducted largely in Danish, at which Grainger was )Tj
T*(fluent. His first letter to Holten, dated 12 August 1905, begins "Dear Miss )Tj
T*(Holten"; by the end of the year she is "My dear Karen". During their long )Tj
T*(separations Grainger's letters become a diary of his activities.[44])Tj
T*(^ There is no evidence up to this time that Grainger could play the )Tj
T*(saxophone,[53] but in an official listing of the band's personnel as of April )Tj
T*(1918 he is listed as a saxophone soloist.[54])Tj
T*(^ Some of Grainger's earliest published letters contain anti-Semitic comments, )Tj
T*(for example to Karen Holten in 1905.[77] He later asserted that the Jewish race )Tj
T*(was less capable of producing good music than the Nordic races,[78] and his )Tj
T*(letter to Quilter of 25 February 1939 is cited by Gillies and Pear as an )Tj
T*(example of his racial intolerance.[76][79])Tj
T*(^ In April 1945 Grainger declined an honorary doctorate from McGill University )Tj
T*(in Montreal, on the grounds that having had only three months' formal )Tj
T*(schooling, his music "must be regarded as a product of non-education".[85])Tj

T*( Richard Cordray \(born May 3, 1959\) is an American Democratic Party politician, )Tj
T*(who is serving as the Director of the United States Consumer Financial )Tj
T*(Protection Bureau, which officially began operating in July 2011.[1] Prior to )Tj
T*(his appointment in January 2012, Cordray served as the Attorney General of )Tj
T*(Ohio. )Tj
T*( On July 17, 2011, President Barack Obama announced he would nominate Cordray )Tj
T*(to lead the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. On January 4, )Tj
T*(2012, the White House announced that it would make a recess appointment of )Tj
T*(Cordray to the post.[2][3][4] )Tj
T*( Cordray was elected Attorney General of Ohio in November 2008 to fill the )Tj
T*(remainder of the unexpired term ending January 2011. On November 2, 2010, )Tj
T*(Cordray lost his bid for re-election to former Lt. Governor and U.S. Senator )Tj
T*(Mike DeWine. Prior to his Attorney General position, Cordray served as the Ohio )Tj
T*(State Treasurer and as treasurer of Franklin County, Ohio. He has also )Tj
T*(previously served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives \(1991‚Äì1993\) )Tj
T*(and as the first Ohio state solicitor \(1993‚Äì1994\). )Tj
T*( Cordray was a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University, 1981‚Äì83. Later, he was )Tj
T*(editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review and subsequently served )Tj
T*(as a law clerk for Judge Robert Bork on the U.S. Court for the District of )Tj
T*(Columbia Circuit \(1986 - 87 term\), and after that, Justice Anthony Kennedy of )Tj
T*(the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1987 he became an undefeated )Tj
T*(five-time Jeopardy! champion.[5] )Tj
T*( After the 1990 census, the district he represented in the Ohio House of )Tj
T*(Representatives in 1992 was merged with another district held by a Democratic )Tj
T*(incumbent. Cordray decided to run for a United States House of Representatives )Tj
T*(seat but did not win the election. The following year he was appointed by the )Tj
T*(Ohio attorney general as the first Ohio state solicitor. His experience as )Tj
T*(Solicitor led to his appearance before the United States Supreme Court to argue )Tj
T*(six cases, where he had previously clerked. Following Republican victories in )Tj
T*(Ohio statewide elections in 1994, Cordray left his appointed position and )Tj
T*(entered the private practice of law. He was elected Franklin County treasurer )Tj
T*(in 2002. While in private practice he unsuccessfully ran for Ohio attorney )Tj
T*(general in 1998 and United States senator in 2000. Cordray won re-election as )Tj
T*(Franklin County treasurer before being elected state treasurer in 2006. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life, education, and early law career )Tj
T*( Cordray was raised in Grove City, Ohio, where he attended public schools. )Tj
T*(While attending Grove City High School, Cordray became a champion on the high )Tj

T*(work as a law clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court, he came back to his high school )Tj
T*(to deliver the commencement speech for the graduating class in 1988.[8] )Tj
T*( Cordray began his career clerking for Judge Robert Bork and Supreme Court )Tj
T*(associate justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy.[6][10] After clerking for )Tj
T*(White in 1987‚Äì1988, he was hired by the international law firm Jones Day to )Tj
T*(work in its Cleveland office.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early political career \(1990-1995\) )Tj
T*( He also taught various courses at The Ohio State University Moritz College of )Tj
T*(Law and at Georgetown University.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ohio House of Representatives )Tj
T*( In 1990 Cordray ran for an Ohio State House of Representatives seat, in the )Tj
T*(33rd District \(southern and western Franklin County\), against six-term )Tj
T*(incumbent Republican Don Gilmore.[11] Unopposed for the Democratic )Tj
T*(nomination,[12] he defeated Gilmore by a 18,573‚Äì11,944 \(61‚Äì39%\) margin.[13] )Tj
T*( As a state representative from 1991 to 1992, Cordray legislated against crime, )Tj
T*(on behalf of the environment, and for the protection of children and )Tj
T*(families.[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] 1992 congressional election )Tj
T*( In 1991 the state Apportionment Board, controlled by a 3‚Äì2 Republican majority )Tj
T*(despite the party's 61‚Äì38 minority in the state House of Representatives,[14] )Tj
T*(redrew state legislative districts following the results of the 1990 Census, in )Tj
T*(the hope of retaking control of the state House.[15] The new boundaries created )Tj
T*(nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with )Tj
T*(the twenty-two-year incumbent Mike Stinziano.[16][17] Unable to be elected in )Tj
T*(another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to )Tj
T*(run for re-election.[18] Instead, he decided to run for Ohio's 15th )Tj
T*(congressional district in the 1992 U.S. House of Representatives elections, a )Tj
T*(seat being vacated by retiring thirteen-term Republican Chalmers Wylie, and )Tj
T*(being challenged by Republican Deborah D. Pryce. )Tj
T*( Cordray won the Democratic nomination over Bill Buckel by a 18,731‚Äì5,329 )Tj
T*(\(78‚Äì22%\) margin,[19] following the withdrawal of another candidate, Dave )Tj
T*(Sommer.[20][21] Cordray's platform included federal spending cuts, term limits )Tj
T*(for Congress and a line-item veto for the president.[22] When Pryce announced )Tj
T*(that she would vote to support abortion rights, Linda S. Reidelbach entered the )Tj
T*(race as an independent.[23] Thus, the general election was a three-way affair, )Tj
T*(with Pryce taking a plurality of 110,390 votes \(44.1%\), Cordray taking 94,907 )Tj
T*(votes \(37.9%\) and Linda Reidelbach taking 44,906 votes \(17.9%\).[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ohio Solicitor General )Tj
T*( While in private practice in 1993, Cordray co-wrote a legal brief for the )Tj
T*(Anti-Defamation League, in a campaign supported by Ohio's attorney general, for )Tj
T*(the reinstatement of Ohio's hate crime laws. This was considered by the U.S. )Tj
T*(Supreme Court, but not ruled on because of its similarity to a previous )Tj
T*(Wisconsin ruling.[25] )Tj
T*( In 1993 the government of Ohio created the office of state solicitor general )Tj
T*(to handle the state's appellate work. The state solicitor, appointed by the )Tj
T*(Ohio attorney general, is responsible for cases that are to be argued before )Tj
T*(the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court. Until 1998, the )Tj
T*(Solicitor worked without any support staff.[26] Cordray, who had earlier worked )Tj
T*(for a summer in the office of the United States solicitor general,[27] was the )Tj
T*(first Solicitor to be appointed, in September 1993.[27] He held the position )Tj
T*(until he resigned after Ohio Attorney General Lee Fisher was defeated by Betty )Tj
T*(Montgomery in 1994.[28][29] His cases before the Supreme Court included Wilson )Tj
T*(v. Layne \(526 U.S. 603 \(1999\)\) and Hanlon v. Berger \(526 U.S. 808 \(1999\)\).[6] )Tj
T*(Though he lost his first case, he won his second case, which garnered a )Tj
T*(substantial amount of media attention for its consideration of the )Tj
T*(constitutionality of media ride-alongs with police.[28] Other cases included )Tj
T*(Household Credit Services v. Pfennig \(541 U.S. 232 \(2004\)\), Brown v. Legal )Tj

T*(Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied )Tj
T*(the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the )Tj
T*(symbolic meaning of the cross was different from the Christmas tree and )Tj
T*(menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit )Tj
T*(Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot \(3¬†m\) cross the )Tj
T*(following day.[30][31] The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on )Tj
T*(Martin Luther King Day \(January 15, 1994\) due to the group's failure to pay a )Tj
T*($15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover )Tj
T*(expenses for the proposed rally.[32] When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of )Tj
T*(Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to )Tj
T*(appeal.[33] The following year the Klan again applied to erect a cross for the )Tj
T*(Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred )Tj
T*(with the prior ruling.[34] The United States Supreme Court did not agree to )Tj
T*(hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his )Tj
T*(solicitor general position.[35] After his resignation in 1994 he several times )Tj
T*(represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's )Tj
T*(appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice )Tj
T*(Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice )Tj
T*(Department.[36] )Tj
T*( Cordray was granted a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could )Tj
T*(not grant a stay of execution for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, )Tj
T*(Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty )Tj
T*(cases be made directly to the Supreme Court.[37] In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit )Tj
T*(Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate \(39 F.3d 622 1994\) limited death row )Tj
T*(inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an )Tj
T*(execution if the case is still in a state court.[38] )Tj
T*( [edit] Latter political career \(1995-2007\) )Tj
T*( In early 1996, Cordray was elected to the Ohio Democratic Party Central )Tj
T*(Committee from the 15th district by a 5,472‚Äì1,718 margin over John J. )Tj
T*(Kulewicz.[39] )Tj
T*( In late 1996 Cordray, who was in private practice at the time, was a leading )Tj
T*(contender and finalist for a United States Attorney position during the second )Tj
T*(term of the Clinton Administration, along with Kent Markus and Sharon )Tj
T*(Zealey.[40][41] Zealey was eventually selected.[42] )Tj
T*( [edit] 1998 Ohio Attorney General election )Tj
T*( During the 1998 election for Ohio attorney general, Cordray ran unopposed in )Tj
T*(the Democratic primary[43] but was defeated, 62%‚Äì38%, by one-term Republican )Tj
T*(incumbent Betty Montgomery.[44][45] )Tj
T*( [edit] 2000 U.S. Senate election )Tj
T*( Cordray entered the U.S. Senate elections in a race that began as a three-way )Tj
T*(contest for the Democratic nomination to oppose first-term Republican incumbent )Tj
T*(Mike DeWine. The three-way race was unusual since the three candidates )Tj
T*(\(Cordray, Rev. Marvin McMickle, and Ted Celeste\) were encouraged to campaign )Tj
T*(together in order to promote name recognition, conserve resources and lessen )Tj
T*(infighting.[46] Ohio Democratic party leaders believed Cordray was better )Tj
T*(suited for an Ohio Supreme Court seat and urged him to drop out of the Senate )Tj
T*(race. Despite the Ohio Democrats not endorsing any candidate in the primary )Tj
T*(election,[47] the entry of Dan Radakovich as a fourth competitor,[48] and the )Tj
T*(anticipated entry of former Mayor of Cincinnati and television personality )Tj
T*(Jerry Springer, Cordray persisted in his campaign.[49] Celeste, the younger )Tj
T*(brother of former Ohio governor Dick Celeste,[50] won with 369,772 votes. He )Tj
T*(was trailed by McMickle \(the only black Senate candidate in the country in )Tj
T*(2000\)[48] with 204,811 votes, Cordray with 200,157, and Radakovich with )Tj
T*(69,002.[51] )Tj
T*( [edit] Franklin County Treasurer )Tj
T*( Cordray was unopposed in the May 7, 2002, primary election for the Democratic )Tj
T*(nomination as Franklin County treasurer.[52] He defeated Republican incumbent )Tj

T*( In the 2004 race for re-election, the Franklin County Republican party made no )Tj

T*(initiatives: collection of delinquent tax revenue through a tax lien )Tj
T*(certificate sale, creation of a land bank, personal finance education, and the )Tj
T*(development of a community outreach program.[62] He managed a portfolio that )Tj
T*(averages $650 million and consistently beat its benchmarks, and he set new )Tj
T*(records for delinquent tax collection in Franklin County, which was the only )Tj
T*(Ohio county with a AAA credit rating.[63][64] He also served as president of )Tj

T*( In the 2006 Democratic party primary election for state treasurer he was set )Tj

T*(for state treasurer in the 2006 election. Cordray succeeded Jennette Bradley in )Tj
T*(a near-statewide sweep by the Democratic Party.[60] Cordray noted that when he )Tj
T*(assumed statewide office, Ohio was challenged with restoring public trust after )Tj
T*(the misdeeds of former Ohio Governor Bob Taft. Referring to what in a similar )Tj
T*(way would be required to follow Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann and his interim )Tj

T*(Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, Jim Petro, )Tj

T*(Cordray's opponents in the race were Michael Crites \(Republican\), and Robert M. )Tj
T*(Owens \(Independent\).[76] Cordray had a large financial advantage over his )Tj
T*(opponents with approximately 30 times as much campaign financing as Crites.[77] )Tj
T*(Crites' campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann‚Äîan )Tj
T*(association the The Columbus Dispatch called into question[78]‚Äîand promoting )Tj

T*( Ohio statewide offices are regularly contested every four years in the midterm )Tj

T*( The curious dealings led to congressional hearings about why the merger )Tj
T*(commenced without any disclosures.[83] In September 2009, Cordray, on behalf of )Tj
T*(Ohio's largest public employee pension funds \(State Teachers Retirement System )Tj
T*(of Ohio and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System\), the Teacher )Tj
T*(Retirement System of Texas and pension funds from Sweden and the Netherlands, )Tj
T*(filed suit alleging that Bank of America, its directors and four executives )Tj
T*(\(Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, Bank of America Chief Financial )Tj
T*(Officer Joe Price, accounting chief Neil Cotty and former Merrill chairman and )Tj
T*(CEO John Thain\) acted to conceal Merrill's growing losses from shareholders )Tj
T*(voted to approve the deal the prior December.[85] )Tj
T*( Prior to the filing the five funds had filed individual complaints, but the )Tj
T*(September filing of an amended complaint joined the actions with Cordray )Tj
T*(representing the lead plaintiff.[85] The amended complaint includes details )Tj
T*(about conversations and communications between Bank of America and Merrill )Tj
T*(Lynch executives that were revealed in media reports, congressional testimony )Tj
T*(and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[84] The filing is )Tj
T*(an attempt to recover losses endured when Bank of America's share price fell )Tj
T*(after the transaction. The damages are sought from Bank of America, individual )Tj
T*(executives, the bank's board of directors, including any insurers that cover )Tj
T*(directors' legal liabilities.[85] Among the specifics of the claim are that )Tj
T*(Bank of America agreed to allow Merrill Lynch to pay as much as $5.8 billion in )Tj
T*(undisclosed year-end discretionary bonuses to executives and employees and that )Tj
T*(Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives were aware of billions of dollars )Tj
T*(in losses suffered by Merrill Lynch in the two months before the merger vote )Tj
T*(but failed to disclose them.[84] )Tj

T*(Marsh &amp; McLennan, Hartford Financial Services and Chubb Corp.\), in a 2007 )Tj
T*(antitrust case regarding business practices between 2001 and 2004. The )Tj
T*(settlement is to be divided among 26 Ohio universities, cities and schools. )Tj
T*(Zurich Financial Services settled in 2006. Cordray believes that Marsh was the )Tj
T*(organizing company for the illegal practices and notes that a trial could )Tj
T*(commence in 2011. AIG admitted no wrongdoing and that the settlement was to )Tj
T*(avoid risks and prolonged expenses.[86] )Tj

T*( On November 2, 2010, Cordray lost his re-election bid to former U.S. senator )Tj

T*(Cordray also stated that he intends to once again, run for statewide office in )Tj
T*(Ohio in 2014.[95][96][97] Cordray described the opportunity to The Wall Street )Tj

T*( On July 17, Cordray was selected over Warren as the head of the entire )Tj

T*(President\) to a centralized structure, noting that both the Securities Exchange )Tj
T*(Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had executive boards and )Tj
T*(that the CFPB should be no different.[102]Politico interpreted Shelby's )Tj
T*(statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was "Dead on Arrival".[103] In )Tj
T*(October, as the nomination continued to be on hold, the National Association of )Tj
T*(Attorneys General endorsed Cordray.[104] On December 8, 2011, the Senate failed )Tj
T*(to secure cloture on Cordray's nomination. The final vote was 53-45.[105] )Tj
T*( On January 4, 2012, a White House communications director announced in a tweet )Tj
T*(that Obama would be giving Cordray a recess appointment to the post, bypassing )Tj
T*(the Senate and installing Cordray.[2][3][4] The move was criticized by )Tj
T*(Republican senators, who argued that Congress had not officially been in )Tj
T*(recess, and that Obama did not have the authority to bypass Congressional )Tj
T*(approval.[106] Writing for the New Republic, Timothy Noah, a supporter of )Tj
T*(Cordray, wrote, "As someone who strongly supported a recess appointment for )Tj
T*(Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I'm confused )Tj
T*(as to why President Obama chose to act today... The trouble is that the Senate )Tj
T*(isn't in recess."[107] On January 24 2013, President Barack Obama renominated )Tj
T*(Cordray to the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau )Tj
T*(position.[108][109][110] )Tj

T*(Frank, Jr. and Jim.[6] He was married in 1992 to Margaret "Peggy" )Tj
T*(Cordray,[6][111] a law professor at Capital University Law School. The Cordrays )Tj
T*(have twins, a daughter and son, and currently reside near Grove City, Ohio.[69] )Tj
T*(Cordray's father, Frank Cordray, Sr., was living in Grove City at the time )Tj
T*(Cordray moved back to Columbus to work for the law firm of Jones Day.[9][14] )Tj
T*(His father retired as an Orient Developmental Center program director for )Tj

T*(Dayton, Ohio,[69] died in 1980.[6][9] She had been a social worker, teacher and )Tj
T*(founder of Ohio's first foster grandparent program for individuals with )Tj
T*(developmental disabilities.[6] Cordray carried the Olympic Flame through )Tj
T*(Findlay, Ohio, as part of the nationwide torch relay to the 1996 Summer )Tj

T*(government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in )Tj
T*(1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been )Tj
T*(formed, and, in December 1990, Wa≈Çƒôsa was elected president. This was soon )Tj
T*(followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by )Tj
T*(Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early )Tj
T*(survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish )Tj
T*(United Workers' Party \(PZPR\), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the )Tj
T*(People's Republic of Poland‚Äîa satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party )Tj
T*(communist regime‚Äîbut for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example )Tj
T*(led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern )Tj
T*(Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the )Tj
T*(Revolutions of 1989. )Tj
T*( In the 1990s, Solidarity's influence on Poland's political scene waned. A )Tj
T*(political arm of the "Solidarity" movement, Solidarity Electoral Action \(AWS\), )Tj
T*(was founded in 1996 and would win the Polish parliamentary elections in 1997, )Tj
T*(only to lose the subsequent 2001 elections. Thereafter, Solidarity had little )Tj
T*(influence as a political party, though it did become the largest trade union in )Tj
T*(Poland. )Tj
T*( [edit] Pre‚Äì1980 roots )Tj
T*( In the 1970s and 1980s, the initial success of Solidarity in particular, and )Tj
T*(of dissident movements in general, was fed by a deepening crisis within )Tj
T*(Soviet-influenced societies. There was declining morale, worsening economic )Tj
T*(conditions \(a shortage economy\), and growing stress from the Cold War.[1] After )Tj
T*(a brief boom period, from 1975 the policies of the Polish government, led by )Tj
T*(Party First Secretary Edward Gierek, precipitated a slide into increasing )Tj
T*(depression, as foreign debt mounted.[2] In June 1976, the first workers' )Tj
T*(strikes took place, involving violent incidents at factories in P≈Çock, Radom )Tj
T*(and Ursus.[3] When these incidents were quelled by the government, the worker's )Tj
T*(movement received support from intellectual dissidents, many of them associated )Tj
T*(with the Committee for Defense of the Workers \(Polish: Komitet Obrony )Tj
T*(Robotnik√≥w, abbreviated KOR\), formed in 1976.[1][4] The following year, KOR was )Tj
T*(renamed the Committee for Social Self-defence \(KSS-KOR\). )Tj
T*( On October 16, 1978, the Bishop of Krak√≥w, Karol Wojty≈Ça, was elected Pope )Tj
T*(John Paul II. A year later, during his first pilgrimage to Poland, his masses )Tj
T*(were attended by hundreds of thousends of his countrymen. The Pope called for )Tj
T*(the respecting of national and religious traditions and advocated for freedom )Tj
T*(and human rights, while denouncing violence. To many Poles, he represented a )Tj
T*(spiritual and moral force that could be set against brute material forces, he )Tj
T*(was a bellwether of change, and became an important symbol‚Äîand supporter‚Äîof )Tj
T*(changes to come.[5][6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Early strikes \(1980\) )Tj
T*( Strikes did not occur merely due to problems that had emerged shortly before )Tj
T*(the labor unrest, but due to governmental and economic difficulties spanning )Tj
T*(more than a decade. In July 1980, Edward Gierek's government, facing economic )Tj
T*(crisis, decided to raise prices while slowing the growth of wages. At once )Tj
T*(there ensued a wave of strikes and factory occupations,[1] with the biggest )Tj
T*(strikes taking place in the area of Lublin. The first strike started on July 8, )Tj
T*(1980 in the State Aviation Works in ≈öwidnik. Although the strike movement had )Tj
T*(no coordinating center, the workers had developed an information network to )Tj
T*(spread news of their struggle. A "dissident" group, the Workers' Defence )Tj
T*(Committee \(KOR\), which had originally been set up in 1976 to organize aid for )Tj
T*(victimized workers, attracted small groups of working-class militants in major )Tj
T*(industrial centers.[1] At the Lenin Shipyard in Gda≈Ñsk, the firing of Anna )Tj
T*(Walentynowicz, a popular crane operator and activist, galvanized the outraged )Tj
T*(workers into action.[1][7] )Tj
T*( On August 14, the shipyard workers began their strike, organized by the Free )Tj
T*(Trade Unions of the Coast \(Wolne ZwiƒÖzki Zawodowe Wybrze≈ºa\).[8] The workers )Tj
T*(were led by electrician Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, a former shipyard worker who had been )Tj

T*(concerns. In addition, they called for the raising of a monument to the )Tj
T*(shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of )Tj
T*(independent trade unions.[9] )Tj
T*(  )Tj
T*(The Polish government enforced censorship, and official media said little about )Tj
T*(the "sporadic labor disturbances in Gda≈Ñsk"; as a further precaution, all phone )Tj
T*(connections between the coast and the rest of Poland were soon cut.[1] )Tj
T*(Nonetheless, the government failed to contain the information: a spreading wave )Tj
T*(of samizdats \(Polish: bibu≈Ça\),[10] including Robotnik \(The Worker\), and )Tj
T*(grapevine gossip, along with Radio Free Europe broadcasts that penetrated the )Tj
T*(Iron Curtain,[11] ensured that the ideas of the emerging Solidarity movement )Tj
T*(quickly spread. )Tj
T*( On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the )Tj
T*(shipyard.[1] Delegates \(Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others\) together with )Tj
T*(shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee )Tj
T*(\(Miƒôdzyzak≈Çadowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS\).[1] On August 17 a priest, Henryk )Tj
T*(Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of )Tj
T*(the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning )Tj
T*(with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a )Tj
T*(relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the )Tj
T*(freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health )Tj
T*(service.[1] )Tj
T*( Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, )Tj
T*(arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibu≈Ça news-sheet, )Tj
T*(Solidarno≈õƒá, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, )Tj
T*(reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies.[1] Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's )Tj
T*(protest song, Mury \(Walls\), gained popularity with the workers.[12] )Tj
T*( On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of )Tj
T*(Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and )Tj
T*(bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many )Tj
T*(intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland )Tj
T*(joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the )Tj
T*(strike committee.[1][7] By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the )Tj
T*(strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial )Tj
T*(Area \(in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j became center of the )Tj
T*(strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j 1980 )Tj
T*(strikes\). More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation. )Tj
T*( Thanks to popular support within Poland, as well as to international support )Tj
T*(and media coverage, the Gda≈Ñsk workers held out until the government gave in to )Tj
T*(their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission \(Komisja RzƒÖdowa\) )Tj
T*(including Mieczys≈Çaw Jagielski arrived in Gda≈Ñsk, and another one with )Tj
T*(Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on )Tj
T*(September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an )Tj
T*(agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to )Tj
T*(strike.[1] This agreement came to be known as the August or Gda≈Ñsk agreement )Tj
T*(\(Porozumienia sierpniowe\).[7] Other agreements were signed in Szczecin )Tj
T*(\(Szczecin Agreement \(August 30\), and Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j on September 3. It was )Tj
T*(called the Jastrzƒôbie Agreement \(Porozumienia jastrzebskie\) and as such is )Tj
T*(regarded as part of the Gda≈Ñsk agreement. Though concerned with labor-union )Tj
T*(matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within )Tj
T*(the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward )Tj
T*(dismantling the Party's monopoly of power.[13] The workers' main concerns were )Tj
T*(the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and )Tj
T*(recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear )Tj
T*(representation.[14] Another consequence of the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement was the )Tj

T*(Solidarity \(Niezale≈ºny SamorzƒÖdny ZwiƒÖzek Zawodowy \(NSZZ\) )Tj
T*("Solidarno≈õƒá"\).[1][7][16] It was the first independent labor union in a )Tj
T*(Soviet-bloc country.[17] Its name was suggested by Karol Modzelewski, and its )Tj
T*(famous logo was conceived by Jerzy Janiszewski, designer of many )Tj
T*(Solidarity-related posters. The new union's supreme powers were vested in a )Tj
T*(legislative body, the Convention of Delegates \(Zjazd Delegat√≥w\). The executive )Tj
T*(branch was the National Coordinating Commission \(Krajowa Komisja )Tj
T*(Porozumiewawcza\), later renamed the National Commission \(Komisja Krajowa\). The )Tj
T*(Union had a regional structure, comprising 38 regions \(region\) and two )Tj
T*(districts \(okrƒôg\).[16] On December 16, 1980, the Monument to Fallen Shipyard )Tj
T*(Workers was unveiled in Gdansk, and on June 28, 1981, another monument was )Tj
T*(unveiled in Poznan, which commemorated the Pozna≈Ñ 1956 protests. On January 15, )Tj
T*(1981, a Solidarity delegation, including Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, met in Rome with Pope )Tj
T*(John Paul II. From September 5 to 10, and from September 26 to October 7, )Tj
T*(Solidarity's first national congress was held, and Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa was elected its )Tj
T*(president.[18] Last accord of the congress was adoption of republican program )Tj
T*("Self-governing Republic".[19] )Tj
T*( Meanwhile Solidarity had been transforming itself from a trade union into a )Tj
T*(social movement[20] or more specifically, a revolutionary movement.[21] Over )Tj
T*(the 500 days following the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement, 9‚Äì10 million workers, )Tj
T*(intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations,[1] such as the )Tj
T*(Independent Student Union \(Niezale≈ºne Zrzeszenie Student√≥w, created in )Tj
T*(September 1980\), the Independent Farmers' Trade Union \(NSZZ Rolnik√≥w )Tj
T*(Indywidualnych "Solidarno≈õƒá" or Rural Solidarity, created in May 1981\) and the )Tj
T*(Independent Craftsmen's Trade Union.[16] It was the only time in recorded )Tj
T*(history that a quarter of a country's population \(some 80% of the total Polish )Tj
T*(work force\) had voluntarily joined a single organization.[1][16]"History has )Tj
T*(taught us that there is no bread without freedom," the Solidarity program )Tj
T*(stated a year later. "What we had in mind was not only bread, butter and )Tj
T*(sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom )Tj
T*(of convictions, and the repair of the republic."[7]Tygodnik Solidarno≈õƒá, a )Tj
T*(Solidarity-published newspaper, was started in April 1981. )Tj
T*( Using strikes and other protest actions, Solidarity sought to force a change )Tj
T*(in government policies. In some cases, as in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, Solidarity managed )Tj
T*(to force corrupt officials of the government to lose their jobs. At the same )Tj
T*(time, it was careful never to use force or violence, so as to avoid giving the )Tj
T*(government any excuse to bring security forces into play.[22][23] After 27 )Tj
T*(Bydgoszcz Solidarity members, including Jan Rulewski, were beaten up on March )Tj
T*(19, a four-hour warning strike on March 27, involving around twelve million )Tj
T*(people, paralyzed the country.[1] This was the largest strike in the history of )Tj
T*(the Eastern bloc,[24] and it forced the government to promise an investigation )Tj
T*(into the beatings.[1] This concession, and Wa≈Çƒôsa's agreement to defer further )Tj
T*(strikes, proved a setback to the movement, as the euphoria that had swept )Tj
T*(Polish society subsided.[1] Nonetheless the Polish communist party‚Äîthe Polish )Tj
T*(United Workers' Party \(PZPR\)‚Äîhad lost its total control over society.[13] )Tj
T*( Yet while Solidarity was ready to take up negotiations with the )Tj
T*(government,[25] the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued )Tj
T*(empty declarations and bided their time.[15] Against the background of a )Tj
T*(deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate )Tj
T*(seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist )Tj
T*(government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement as the )Tj
T*(only way out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The )Tj
T*(atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a )Tj
T*(growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the )Tj
T*(Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening )Tj
T*(economic situation.[1] On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour )Tj
T*(strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to )Tj
T*(suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers )Tj
T*(were used. )Tj

T*( [edit] Martial law \(1981‚Äì83\) )Tj
T*( After the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement, the Polish government was under increasing )Tj
T*(pressure from the Soviet Union to take action and strengthen its position. )Tj
T*(Stanis≈Çaw Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on October 18, )Tj
T*(1981, the Party Central Committee put him in the minority. Kania lost his post )Tj
T*(as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister \(and Minister of )Tj
T*(Defence\) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.[25] )Tj
T*( On December 13, 1981, Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity, declaring )Tj
T*(martial law and creating a Military Council of National Salvation \(Wojskowa )Tj
T*(Rada Ocalenia Narodowego, or WRON\). Solidarity's leaders, gathered at Gda≈Ñsk, )Tj
T*(were arrested and isolated in facilities guarded by the Security Service )Tj
T*(\(S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa or SB\), and some 5,000 Solidarity supporters were )Tj
T*(arrested in the middle of the night.[1][16] Censorship was expanded, and )Tj
T*(military forces appeared on the streets.[25] A couple of hundred strikes and )Tj
T*(occupations occurred, chiefly at the largest plants and at several Silesian )Tj
T*(coal mines, but were broken by ZOMO paramilitary riot police. One of the )Tj
T*(largest demonstrations, on December 16, 1981, took place at the Wujek Coal )Tj
T*(Mine, where government forces opened fire on demonstrators, killing 9[1] and )Tj
T*(seriously injuring 22.[18] The next day, during protests at Gda≈Ñsk, government )Tj
T*(forces again fired at demonstrators, killing 1 and injuring 2. By December 28, )Tj
T*(1981, strikes had ceased, and Solidarity appeared crippled. The last strike in )Tj
T*(the 1981 Poland, which ended on December 28, took place in the Piast Coal Mine )Tj
T*(in the Upper Silesian town of Bieru≈Ñ. It was the longest underground strike in )Tj
T*(the history of Poland, lasting 14 days. Some 2000 miners began it on December )Tj
T*(14, going 650 meters underground. Out of the initial 2000, half remained until )Tj
T*(the last day. Starving, they gave up after military authorities promised they )Tj
T*(would not be prosecuted.[26] On October 8, 1982, Solidarity was banned.[27] )Tj
T*( The range of support for the Solidarity was unique: no other movement in the )Tj
T*(world was supported by Ronald Reagan and Santiago Carrillo, Enrico Berlinguer )Tj
T*(and the Pope, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Benn, peace campaigners and NATO )Tj
T*(spokesman, Christians and Western communists, conservatives, liberals and )Tj
T*(socialists.[28] The international community outside the Iron Curtain condemned )Tj
T*(Jaruzelski's actions and declared support for Solidarity; dedicated )Tj
T*(organizations were formed for that purpose \(like Polish Solidarity Campaign in )Tj
T*(Great Britain\).[16] US President Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions on )Tj
T*(Poland, which eventually would force the Polish government into liberalizing )Tj
T*(its policies.[29] Meanwhile the CIA[30] together with the Catholic Church and )Tj
T*(various Western trade unions such as the AFL-CIO provided funds, equipment and )Tj
T*(advice to the Solidarity underground.[31] The political alliance of Reagan and )Tj
T*(the Pope would prove important to the future of Solidarity.[31] The Polish )Tj
T*(public also supported what was left of Solidarity; a major medium for )Tj
T*(demonstrating support of Solidarity became masses held by priests such as Jerzy )Tj
T*(Popie≈Çuszko.[32] )Tj
T*( Besides the communist authorities, Solidarity was also opposed by some of the )Tj
T*(Polish \(√©migr√©\) radical right, believing Solidarity or KOR to be disguised )Tj
T*(communist groups, dominated by Jewish Trotskyite Zionists.[33] )Tj
T*( In July 1983, martial law was formally lifted, though many heightened controls )Tj
T*(on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in )Tj
T*(place through the mid-to-late 1980s.[34] )Tj
T*( [edit] Underground Solidarity \(1982‚Äì88\) )Tj
T*( Almost immediately after the legal Solidarity leadership had been arrested, )Tj
T*(underground structures began to arise.[16] On April 12, 1982, Radio Solidarity )Tj

T*( Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persevered as an exclusively underground )Tj
T*(organization.[37] Its activists were dogged by the Security Service \(SB\), but )Tj
T*(managed to strike back: on May 1, 1982, a series of anti-government protests )Tj
T*(brought out thousands of participants‚Äîseveral dozen thousand in Krak√≥w, Warsaw )Tj
T*(and Gda≈Ñsk.[18] On May 3 more protests took place, during celebrations of the )Tj
T*(Constitution of May 3, 1791. On that day, communist secret services killed four )Tj
T*(demonstrators ‚Äì three in Warsaw and one in Wroc≈Çaw. Another wave of )Tj
T*(demonstrations occurred on August 31, 1982, on the first anniversary of the )Tj
T*(Gda≈Ñsk Agreement \(see August 31, 1982 demonstrations in Poland\). Altogether, on )Tj
T*(that day six demonstrators were killed ‚Äì three in Lubin, one in Kielce, one in )Tj
T*(Wroc≈Çaw and one in Gda≈Ñsk. Another person was killed on the next day, during a )Tj
T*(demonstration in Czƒôstochowa. Further strikes occurred at Gda≈Ñsk and Nowa Huta )Tj
T*(between October 11 and 13.[18] In Nowa Huta, a 20-year old student Bogdan )Tj
T*(Wlosik was shot by a secret service officer. )Tj
T*( On November 14, 1982, Wa≈Çƒôsa was released.[16] However on December 9 the SB )Tj
T*(carried out a large anti-Solidarity operation, arresting over 10,000 activists. )Tj
T*(On December 27 Solidarity's assets were transferred by the authorities to a )Tj
T*(pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions )Tj
T*(\(Og√≥lnopolskie Porozumienie ZwiƒÖzk√≥w Zawodowych, or OPZZ\). Yet Solidarity was )Tj
T*(far from broken: by early 1983 the underground had over 70,000 members, whose )Tj
T*(activities included publishing over 500 underground newspapers.[38] In the )Tj
T*(first half of 1983 street protests were frequent; on May 1, two persons were )Tj
T*(killed in Krak√≥w and one in Wroc≈Çaw. Two days later, two additional )Tj
T*(demonstrators were killed in Warsaw. )Tj
T*( On July 22, 1983, martial law was lifted, and amnesty was granted to many )Tj
T*(imprisoned Solidarity members, who were released.[37] On October 5, Wa≈Çƒôsa was )Tj
T*(awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[39] The Polish government, however, refused to )Tj

T*(Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and )Tj
T*(discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s.[18] In the late 1980s, a )Tj
T*(rift between Wa≈Çƒôsa's faction and a more radical Fighting Solidarity grew as )Tj
T*(the former wanted to negotiate with the government, while the latter planned )Tj
T*(for an anti-communist revolution.[35][45][46] )Tj
T*( By 1988, Poland's economy was in worse condition than it had been eight years )Tj
T*(earlier. International sanctions, combined with the government's unwillingness )Tj
T*(to introduce reforms, intensified the old problems.[29][39] Inefficient )Tj
T*(government-run planned-economy enterprises wasted labor and resources, )Tj
T*(producing substandard goods for which there was little demand. Polish exports )Tj
T*(were low, both because of the sanctions and because the goods were as )Tj
T*(unattractive abroad as they were at home. Foreign debt and inflation mounted. )Tj
T*(There were no funds to modernize factories, and the promised "market socialism" )Tj
T*(materialized as a shortage economy characterized by long queues and empty )Tj
T*(shelves.[47] Reforms introduced by Jaruzelski and Mieczys≈Çaw Rakowski came too )Tj
T*(little and too late, especially as changes in the Soviet Union had bolstered )Tj
T*(the public's expectation that change must come, and the Soviets ceased their )Tj
T*(efforts to prop up Poland's failing regime.[39][48] )Tj
T*( In February 1988, the government hiked food prices by 40%.[39] On April 21, a )Tj
T*(new wave of strikes hit the country.[39] On May 2, workers at the Gda≈Ñsk )Tj
T*(Shipyard went on strike.[18] That strike was broken by the government between )Tj
T*(May 5 and May 10, but only temporarily: on August 15, a new strike took place )Tj
T*(at the "July Manifesto" mine in Jastrzƒôbie Zdr√≥j.[18] By August 20 the strike )Tj
T*(had spread to many other mines, and on August 22 the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard joined the )Tj
T*(strike.[18] Poland's communist government then decided to negotiate.[16][39] )Tj
T*( On August 26, Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs, declared on )Tj
T*(television that the government was willing to negotiate, and five days later he )Tj
T*(met with Wa≈Çƒôsa. The strikes ended the following day, and on November 30, )Tj
T*(during a televised debate between Wa≈Çƒôsa and Alfred Miodowicz \(leader of the )Tj
T*(pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions\), Wa≈Çƒôsa )Tj
T*(scored a public-relations victory.[39][49] )Tj
T*( On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens' Committee \(Komitet Obywatelski\) was )Tj
T*(formed within Solidarity. It comprised several sections, each responsible for )Tj
T*(presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wa≈Çƒôsa )Tj
T*(and the majority of Solidarity leaders supported negotiation, while a minority )Tj
T*(wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wa≈Çƒôsa's leadership, Solidarity )Tj
T*(decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never )Tj
T*(attained any substantial power, nor did it take any action.[22][23] )Tj
T*( On January 27, 1989, in a meeting between Wa≈Çƒôsa and Kiszczak, a list was )Tj
T*(drawn up of members of the main negotiating teams. The conference that began on )Tj
T*(February 6 would be known as the Polish Round Table Talks.[50] The 56 )Tj
T*(participants included 20 from "S", 6 from OPZZ, 14 from the PZPR, 14 )Tj
T*("independent authorities", and two priests. The Polish Round Table Talks took )Tj
T*(place in Warsaw from February 6 to April 4, 1989. The Communists, led by Gen. )Tj
T*(Jaruzelski, hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group )Tj
T*(without making major changes in the structure of political power. Solidarity, )Tj
T*(while hopeful, did not anticipate major changes. In fact, the talks would )Tj
T*(radically alter the shape of the Polish government and society.[48][50] )Tj
T*( On April 17, 1989, Solidarity was legalized, and its membership soon reached )Tj
T*(1.5 million.[16][18] The Solidarity Citizens' Committee \(Komitet Obywatelski )Tj
T*("Solidarno≈õƒá"\) was given permission to field candidates in the upcoming )Tj
T*(elections. Election law allowed Solidarity to put forward candidates for only )Tj
T*(35% of the seats in the Sejm, but there were no restrictions in regard to Senat )Tj
T*(candidates.[51] Agitation and propaganda continued legally up to election day. )Tj
T*(Despite its shortage of resources, Solidarity managed to carry on an electoral )Tj
T*(campaign.[50][51] On May 8, the first issue of a new pro-Solidarity newspaper, )Tj
T*(Gazeta Wyborcza \(The Election Gazette\), was published.[52] Posters of Wa≈Çƒôsa )Tj
T*(supporting various candidates, appeared throughout the country. )Tj
T*( Pre-election public-opinion polls had promised victory to the communists.[50] )Tj

T*(to all involved: after the first round of elections, it became evident that )Tj
T*(Solidarity had fared extremely well,[48] capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm )Tj
T*(seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually )Tj
T*(every seat‚Äîall 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.[51] )Tj
T*( These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, )Tj
T*(inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and )Tj
T*(Eastern Europe[23][53][54] that eventually culminated in the fall of )Tj
T*(communism.[55][56] )Tj
T*( The new Contract Sejm, named for the agreement that had been reached by the )Tj
T*(communist party and the Solidarity movement during the Polish Round Table )Tj
T*(Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity. As agreed beforehand, Wojciech )Tj
T*(Jaruzelski was elected president.[48][51] However, the communist candidate for )Tj
T*(Prime Minister, Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak, who replaced Mieczys≈Çaw Rakowski,[48] failed )Tj
T*(to gain enough support to form a government.[51][57] )Tj
T*( On June 23, a Solidarity Citizens' Parliamentary Club \(Obywatelski Klub )Tj
T*(Parliamentarny "Solidarno≈õƒá"\) was formed, led by Bronis≈Çaw Geremek.[48] It )Tj
T*(formed a coalition with two ex-satellite parties of the PZPR ‚Äî United People's )Tj
T*(Party and Democratic Party ‚Äî which had now chosen to "rebel" against the PZPR, )Tj
T*(which found itself in the minority.[57] On August 24, the Sejm elected Tadeusz )Tj
T*(Mazowiecki, a Solidarity representative, to be Prime Minister of )Tj
T*(Poland.[48][51][57] Not only was he a first non-communist Polish Prime Minister )Tj
T*(since 1945, he became the first non-Communist prime minister in Eastern Europe )Tj
T*(for nearly 40 years.[48] In his speech he talked about the "thick line" \(Gruba )Tj
T*(kreska\) which would separate his government from the communist past[58] By the )Tj
T*(end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed. )Tj
T*( [edit] Party and trade union \(1989 to the present\) )Tj
T*( The fall of the communist regime marked a new chapter in the history of Poland )Tj
T*(and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated the communist government, )Tj
T*(Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for ‚Äî that of a )Tj
T*(political party ‚Äî and soon began to lose popularity.[16][59] Conflicts among )Tj
T*(Solidarity factions intensified.[16][60] Wa≈Çƒôsa was elected Solidarity )Tj
T*(chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main )Tj
T*(opponents, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In )Tj
T*(September 1990, Wa≈Çƒôsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the )Tj
T*(Solidarity logo. )Tj
T*( Later that month, Wa≈Çƒôsa announced his intent to run for president of Poland. )Tj
T*(In December 1990, he was elected president.[16] He resigned his Solidarity post )Tj
T*(and became the first president of Poland ever to be elected by popular vote. )Tj
T*( Next year, in February 1991, Marian Krzaklewski was elected the leader of )Tj
T*(Solidarity.[16] President Wa≈Çƒôsa's vision and that of the new Solidarity )Tj
T*(leadership were diverging. Far from supporting Wa≈Çƒôsa, Solidarity was becoming )Tj
T*(increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own )Tj
T*(political party for action in the upcoming 1991 parliamentary elections.[61] )Tj
T*( The 1991 elections were characterized by a large number of competing parties, )Tj
T*(many claiming the legacy of anti-communism, and the Solidarity party garnered )Tj
T*(only 5% of the votes. )Tj
T*( On January 13, 1992, Solidarity declared its first strike against the )Tj
T*(democratically elected government: a one-hour strike against a proposal to )Tj
T*(raise energy prices. Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On May )Tj
T*(19, 1993, Solidarity deputies proposed a no-confidence motion‚Äîwhich )Tj
T*(passed‚Äîagainst the government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka.[16] President )Tj
T*(Wa≈Çƒôsa declined to accept the prime minister's resignation, and dismissed the )Tj
T*(parliament. )Tj
T*( It was in the ensuing 1993 parliamentary elections that it became evident how )Tj
T*(much Solidarity's support had eroded in the previous three years. Even though )Tj
T*(some Solidarity deputies sought to assume a more left-wing stance and to )Tj
T*(distance themselves from the right-wing government, Solidarity remained )Tj
T*(identified in the public mind with that government. Hence it suffered from the )Tj
T*(growing disillusionment of the populace, as the transition from a communist to )Tj
T*(a capitalist system failed to generate instant wealth and raise Poland's living )Tj

T*( Plot )Tj
T*( Optimus Prime, leader of the benevolent Autobots, narrates the collapse of the )Tj
T*(Transformers' home world, Cybertron. It was destroyed by war between the )Tj
T*(Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, lead by Megatron in his quest to get )Tj
T*(hold of the AllSpark. The Autobots want to find the AllSpark so they can use it )Tj
T*(to rebuild Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons want to use it to )Tj
T*(defeat the Autobots and take over the universe. Megatron had managed to locate )Tj
T*(the AllSpark on Earth, but crash-landed in the Arctic Circle and froze in the )Tj
T*(ice. After stumbling upon his frozen body in 1897, explorer Captain Archibald )Tj
T*(Witwicky accidentally activated Megatron's navigational system and his eye )Tj
T*(glasses were imprinted with the coordinates of the AllSpark's location, an )Tj
T*(incident that left him blind and mentally unstable. Sector 7, a secret )Tj
T*(government organization created by President Herbert Hoover, discovered the )Tj
T*(AllSpark in the Colorado River and built the Hoover Dam around it to mask its )Tj
T*(energy emissions. The still-frozen Megatron was moved into this facility and )Tj
T*(was used to advance human technology through reverse engineering. )Tj
T*( In the present day, the Decepticon known as Blackout arrives in a U.S. )Tj
T*(military base in Qatar to find the location of Megatron and the AllSpark. He )Tj
T*(tries to hack into the files of the computer base, but is stopped by Captain )Tj
T*(William Lennox and his team. Back in the United States, Captain Witwicky's )Tj
T*(descendant Sam Witwicky buys his first car which turns out to be the Autobot )Tj
T*(scout Bumblebee, who tries to help him woo his crush Mikaela Banes. Later, Sam )Tj
T*(catches a glimpse of Bumblebee's true form when he signals the other Autobots. )Tj
T*( On Air Force One, another Decepticon named Frenzy infiltrates the plane and )Tj
T*(tries to hack into the network again, only this time is more successful until )Tj
T*(he is stopped by the US Security Defense before he can retrieve all of the file )Tj
T*(information. Frenzy is then picked up by his partner Barricade and they go )Tj
T*(after Sam after learning he has the glasses needed to find the AllSpark. Sam is )Tj
T*(rescued by Bumblebee and Mikaela also learns of the Transformers' existence. )Tj

T*(feel like you're ten years old even if you're thirty-five.")Tj
T*(‚Äî Tom DeSanto on why he produced the film[4])Tj
T*( Don Murphy was planning a G.I. Joe film adaptation, but when the United States )Tj
T*(launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the )Tj
T*(Transformers franchise instead.[5]Tom DeSanto joined Murphy because he was a )Tj
T*(fan of the series.[6] They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited )Tj
T*(the Generation 1 cartoon and comics as their main influence.[5] They made the )Tj
T*(Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the )Tj
T*(film series The Matrix.[7] DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human )Tj
T*(point-of-view to engage the audience,[8] while Murphy wanted it to have a )Tj
T*(realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film.[7] The treatment featured the )Tj
T*(Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and )Tj
T*(Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, )Tj
T*(Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.[9] )Tj
T*( Steven Spielberg, a fan of the comics and toys,[6] signed on as executive )Tj
T*(producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots )Tj
T*(against four Decepticons,[10] and featured the Ark spaceship.[11]Roberto Orci )Tj
T*(and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon,[12] were hired to rewrite the script in )Tj
T*(February 2005.[13] Spielberg suggested that "a boy and his car" should be the )Tj
T*(focus.[14] This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of )Tj
T*(adulthood and responsibility, "the things that a car represents in the United )Tj
T*(States".[15] The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point-of-view )Tj
T*(given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft.[16] The Transformers had no dialogue, )Tj
T*(as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt )Tj
T*(that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the )Tj
T*(fanbase.[12] The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon.[17] )Tj
T*(Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for )Tj
T*(improvement.[14] The writers remained involved throughout production, adding )Tj
T*(additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing \(although none of )Tj
T*(this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the )Tj
T*(initial edit\).[18] Furman's The Ultimate Guide, published by Dorling )Tj
T*(Kindersley, remained as a resource to the writers throughout )Tj
T*(production.[18]Prime Directive was used as a fake working title. This was also )Tj
T*(the name of Dreamwave Productions' first Transformers comic book.[19] )Tj
T*( Michael Bay was asked to direct by Spielberg on July 30, 2005, but he )Tj
T*(dismissed the film as a "stupid toy movie".[21] Nonetheless, he wanted to work )Tj
T*(with Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the concept upon visiting Hasbro. )Tj
T*(Bay considered the first draft "too kiddie", so he increased the military's )Tj

T*(soldier characters, being careful not to mix the brands.[23] Because Orci and )Tj
T*(Kurtzman were concerned the film could feel like a military recruitment )Tj
T*(commercial, they chose to make the military believe nations like Iran were )Tj
T*(behind the Decepticon attack as well as making the Decepticons primarily )Tj
T*(military vehicles.[citation needed] Bay based Lennox' struggle to get to the )Tj
T*(Pentagon phoneline while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real )Tj
T*(account he was given by a soldier when working on another film. )Tj
T*( Orci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise, )Tj
T*(ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form )Tj
T*(the final cast.[6] Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected )Tj
T*(before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing )Tj
T*(the toys.[24] Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they )Tj
T*(had been leaked.[25] Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only )Tj
T*(characters present in each version of the script.[12]Arcee was a female )Tj
T*(Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found )Tj
T*(it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, )Tj
T*(which he found too small.[23] An early idea to have the Decepticons )Tj
T*(simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.[16] )Tj
T*( Design )Tj
T*( The filmmakers created the size of each robot with the size of their vehicle )Tj
T*(mode in mind, supporting the Transformer's rationale for their choice of )Tj
T*(disguise on Earth.[26] The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by )Tj
T*(Roberto Orci when he wondered why "aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other )Tj
T*(vehicles to travel".[27] This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look, )Tj
T*(away from the "blocky" Generation¬†1 Transformers.[28] Another major influence )Tj
T*(in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins )Tj

T*(October 4, 2006.[22] )Tj
T*( The film has been found to re-use footage from Bay's previous film Pearl )Tj
T*(Harbor.[33] )Tj
T*( Effects )Tj
T*( Spielberg encouraged Bay to restrict computer-generated imagery to the robots )Tj
T*(and background elements in the action sequences. Stunts such as Bonecrusher )Tj
T*(smashing through a bus were done practically, while cameras were placed into )Tj
T*(the midst of car crashes and explosions to make it look more exciting.[32] Work )Tj
T*(on the animatics began in April 2005.[10] Bay indicated that three quarters of )Tj
T*(the film's effects were made by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, while Digital )Tj
T*(Domain made the rest, including the Arctic discovery of Megatron; Frenzy's )Tj
T*(severed head; a vending machine mutated by the Allspark, and the Autobots' )Tj
T*(protoforms.[34] Many of the animators were big Transformers fans and were given )Tj
T*(free rein to experiment: a scene where Jazz attacks Brawl is a reference to a )Tj
T*(scene in The Transformers: The Movie where Kup jumps on Blitzwing.[26] )Tj
T*("I just didn't want to make the boxy characters. It's boring and it would look )Tj
T*(fake. By adding more doo-dads and stuff on the robots, more car parts, you can )Tj
T*(just make it more real.")Tj
T*(‚Äî Michael Bay on the level of detail he wanted for the robots[35])Tj
T*( ILM created computer-generated transformations during six months in 2005, )Tj
T*(looking at every inch of the car models.[36] Initially the transformations were )Tj
T*(made to follow the laws of physics, but it did not look exciting enough and was )Tj
T*(changed to be more fluid.[37] Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the )Tj
T*(characters' faces, instead going for a "Rubik's Cube" style of modeling. He )Tj
T*(wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more )Tj
T*(interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather than like lumbering )Tj
T*(beasts.[35] One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as )Tj
T*(long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed.[38] Bay )Tj
T*(instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous )Tj
T*(martial arts films to make the fights look graceful. )Tj
T*( Due to the intricate designs of the Transformers, even the simplest motion of )Tj
T*(turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts;[31] each of Ironhide's guns are made of )Tj
T*(ten thousand parts.[35] Bumblebee uses a piece below his faceplate as an )Tj
T*(eyebrow, pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile, and all the )Tj
T*(characters' eyes are designed to dilate and brighten.[38] According to Bay, )Tj
T*("The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to )Tj
T*(render just one frame of movement";[31] that meant ILM had to increase their )Tj
T*(processing facilities.[39] Each rendered piece had to look like real metal, )Tj
T*(shiny or dull. This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots )Tj
T*(had to transform from clean cars. Close-up shots of the robots were sped up to )Tj
T*(look "cool", but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly )Tj
T*(illustrate a sense of weight. Photographs were taken of each set. These were )Tj
T*(used as a reference for the lighting environment, which was reproduced within a )Tj
T*(computer, so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there. )Tj
T*(Bay, who has directed numerous car commercials, understood ray tracing was the )Tj
T*(key to making the robots look real; the CG models would look realistic based on )Tj
T*(how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies.[26] Numerous )Tj
T*(simulations were programmed into the robots, so the animators could focus on )Tj
T*(animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance.[39] )Tj
T*( Music )Tj
T*( Composer Steve Jablonsky, who collaborated with Bay on The Island, scored )Tj
T*(music for the trailers before work began on the film itself. Recording took )Tj
T*(place in April 2007, at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. The )Tj
T*(score, including the teaser music, uses six major themes across ninety minutes )Tj
T*(of music.[40] The Autobots have three themes, one named "Optimus" to represent )Tj
T*(the wisdom and compassion of the Autobot leader, and another played during )Tj
T*(their arrival on Earth. The Decepticons have a chanted theme which relies on )Tj
T*(electronics, unlike most of the score. The AllSpark also has its own )Tj
T*(theme.[41]Hans Zimmer, Jablonsky's mentor, also helped to compose the score. )Tj

T*( Typhoon Sudal \(international designation: 0401, JTWC designation: 03W, PAGASA )Tj
T*(name: Cosme\) was the strongest typhoon to strike the island of Yap in the )Tj
T*(Federated States of Micronesia \(FSM\) in about 50¬†years. Yap is one of the four )Tj
T*(administrative divisions of the FSM. The entire island, only 17¬†km \(11¬†mi\) in )Tj
T*(length, experienced typhoon force winds, and 90% of the structures were damaged )Tj
T*(or destroyed. Damage was most severe in southeastern Yap, where the eyewall )Tj
T*(struck and winds exceeded 185¬†km/h \(115¬†mph\), but the center of the typhoon )Tj
T*(passed south of the island. )Tj
T*( Typhoon Sudal originally formed on April¬†2, 2004 out of a persistent area of )Tj
T*(convection east of the FSM. It moved mostly westward for the first week of its )Tj
T*(duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. Sudal attained tropical )Tj
T*(storm status on April¬†5, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is )Tj
T*(a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119¬†km/h \(74¬†mph\) and is the )Tj
T*(equivalent of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. On April¬†9, it passed just )Tj
T*(south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240¬†km/h )Tj
T*(\(150¬†mph\). Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, )Tj
T*(becoming an extratropical cyclone on April¬†16 and dissipating two days later. )Tj
T*( In addition to the damage on Yap, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in Chuuk )Tj
T*(in the Federated States of Micronesia, where some minor crop damage occurred. )Tj
T*(Sudal also brushed the United States islands of Guam and Rota with high waves )Tj
T*(and light rainfall, and later moved very close to the uninhabited Japanese )Tj
T*(island of Iwo Jima. Overall damage was $14¬†million \(2004¬†USD, $16.1¬†million )Tj
T*(2010¬†USD\), most of which was on Yap, although no fatalities or serious injuries )Tj
T*(were reported. Due to the heavy damage, the name was retired and replaced with )Tj
T*(Mirinae. The name "Sudal" was contributed by South Korea for the Pacific )Tj
T*(tropical cyclone list and is the Korean name for the otter.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Meteorological history )Tj
T*( The origins of Typhoon Sudal were from a persistent area of convection, or )Tj
T*(thunderstorms, southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia )Tj

T*(which is the change in wind direction with height and is unfavorable for )Tj
T*(tropical cyclogenesis. The unfavorable conditions gradually abated, which )Tj
T*(allowed convection to increase over a broad, developing circulation center.[1] )Tj
T*(On April¬†2, the Japan Meteorological Agency \(JMA\) classified the system as a )Tj
T*(weak tropical depression near Chuuk in the FSM. It was later classified with )Tj
T*(the international designation of 0401, meaning it was the first tropical )Tj
T*(cyclone of 2004.[2] Slow development continued as the system moved slowly )Tj
T*(westward, and two days later it was classified as Tropical Depression 03W by )Tj
T*(the Joint Typhoon Warning Center \(JTWC\); this was the third tropical cyclone )Tj
T*(tracked by the agency. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the depression to )Tj
T*(tropical storm status, after convection increased over the circulation.[1] )Tj
T*( While steadily intensifying, the system turned toward the north. On April¬†5, )Tj
T*(the JMA named the system Sudal, after assessing its maximum sustained winds at )Tj
T*(65¬†km/h \(40¬†mph 10-min sustained\).[2] Concurrently, the JTWC estimated winds of )Tj
T*(100¬†km/h \(65¬†km/h 1-min sustained\).[1] After crossing over the island of )Tj
T*(Poluwat,[3] a building ridge to the north caused Sudal to turn )Tj
T*(west-southwestward. On April¬†6, an eye feature began forming, and the JTWC )Tj
T*(upgraded Sudal to typhoon strength about 540¬†km \(340¬†mi\) southeast of Guam, a )Tj
T*(small island under possession of the United States.[1] The JMA did not follow )Tj
T*(suit until late the following day,[2] by which time the eye had become more )Tj
T*(distinct.[1] Around that time, the typhoon turned toward the northwest, and )Tj
T*(initially it was thought that Sudal would pass safely north of Yap in the )Tj
T*(FSM.[3] Instead, it turned to the west-southwest toward the island as the ridge )Tj
T*(intensified. On April¬†8, the typhoon intensified rapidly; the JTWC reported )Tj
T*(winds of 215¬†km/h \(135¬†mph 1-min sustained\), or the equivalent of a Category¬†4 )Tj
T*(on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Weakening slightly as its forward motion )Tj
T*(slowed, Typhoon Sudal passed about 45¬†km \(28¬†mi\) south of Yap at 0000¬†UTC on )Tj
T*(April¬†9, which was its closest approach to the island.[1] )Tj
T*( Intensification continued throughout the day on April¬†9, with the appearance )Tj
T*(of concentric eyewalls on satellite imagery; such a feature is indicative of an )Tj
T*(intense tropical cyclone. Early on April¬†10, the JTWC estimated that Sudal )Tj
T*(attained peak winds of 240¬†km/h \(150¬†mph 1-min sustained\), making the cyclone a )Tj
T*(super typhoon.[1] At the same time, the JMA estimated peak winds of 165¬†km/h )Tj
T*(\(105¬†mph 10-min sustained\), as well as a barometric pressure of 940¬†mbar \(27.76¬†)Tj
T*(inHg\).[2] Also on that day, Sudal entered the area of warning responsibility of )Tj
T*(the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services )Tj
T*(Administration \(PAGASA\), which provided the name "Cosme" for local advisories. )Tj
T*(For several days, the typhoon continued to the northwest, fluctuating in )Tj
T*(intensity but remaining powerful. On April¬†12, Sudal turned toward the north )Tj
T*(and northeast through a weakness in the ridge, and its eye increased to a )Tj
T*(diameter of about 85¬†km \(53¬†mi\). The next day, the typhoon attained a secondary )Tj
T*(peak intensity of 230¬†km/h \(145¬†mph 1-min sustained\), although it gradually )Tj
T*(weakened subsequently due to a combination of increasing upper-level wind shear )Tj
T*(and cooler water temperatures.[1] )Tj
T*( Early on April¬†15, Sudal passed very near the uninhabited Japanese island of )Tj
T*(Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center )Tj
T*(was exposed from the deepest convection.[1] Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC )Tj
T*(and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status.[1][2] Late on April¬†15, the )Tj
T*(JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained )Tj
T*(advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued )Tj
T*(northeastward until losing its identity early on April¬†18, well east of Japan )Tj
T*(and far south of the Aleutian Islands.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Differences among warning centers )Tj
T*( The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute sustained winds for its )Tj
T*(tropical cyclone tracking information, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center )Tj
T*(uses 1-minute sustained winds.[4][5] The peak 10-minute sustained winds were )Tj
T*(165¬†km/h \(105¬†mph\) from JMA and 210¬†km/h \(130¬†mph\) from JTWC. The peak 1-minute )Tj

T*( [edit] Impact )Tj
T*( Early in its duration as a weak tropical storm, Sudal passed near Chuuk state )Tj
T*(in the Federated States of Micronesia \(FSM\). One station reported 17¬†cm \(6.68¬†)Tj
T*(inches\) of rainfall in a 24¬†hour period. The passage of the storm left minor )Tj
T*(roof damage and some crop damage, due to storm surge contaminating groundwater. )Tj
T*(No deaths or injuries were reported in the state.[3] The storm briefly )Tj
T*(threatened Guam,[1] and as it passed south of the island, Sudal produced 5.5¬†m )Tj
T*(\(18¬†ft\) waves and a 0.9¬†m \(3¬†ft\) storm surge. A station at Apra Harbor recorded )Tj
T*(a 69¬†km/h \(43¬†mph\) wind gust, and light rainfall of around 5¬†cm \(2.0¬†in\) was )Tj
T*(reported, although no damage was reported on the island. High waves also )Tj
T*(occurred on Rota in the Northern Marianas Islands.[7] The FSM is an independent )Tj
T*(nation in Compact of Free Association with the United States, and the latter )Tj
T*(nation is responsible for aid and protection.[8] )Tj
T*( Further west, Typhoon Sudal intensified quickly as it moved through the )Tj
T*(Caroline Islands and later Yap state. On Ulithi, a wind gust of 132¬†km/h \(82¬†)Tj
T*(mph\) was reported, and 6.34¬†inches of rainfall occurred in a 24¬†hour period. )Tj
T*(High waves of over 5¬†m \(18¬†ft\) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion )Tj
T*(and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some )Tj
T*(poorly built homes. On nearby Faraulep and Fais islands, similar meteorological )Tj
T*(conditions and damages were reported. The small Ngulu Atoll received gale force )Tj
T*(winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's water storage )Tj
T*(tanks.[3] Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind )Tj
T*(gusts of 141¬†km/h \(87¬†mph\).[1] )Tj
T*( The worst of the damage occurred on the island of Yap. Initially, the typhoon )Tj
T*(was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, )Tj
T*(but instead the island experienced the brunt of the storm.[3]Typhoon Lupit )Tj
T*(affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still )Tj
T*(recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials )Tj
T*(rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon )Tj
T*(struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that )Tj
T*(could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap )Tj
T*(officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up )Tj
T*(after the storm.[9] )Tj
T*( On April¬†9, the eye of Sudal briefly passed over the southern portion of the )Tj
T*(island, and winds of 185¬†km/h \(115¬†mph\) struck the island for about four )Tj
T*(hours.[3] The entire island, only 17¬†km \(11¬†mi\) in length, experienced typhoon )Tj
T*(force winds.[10]Yap International Airport recorded a peak wind gust of 181¬†km/h )Tj
T*(\(112¬†mph\); a subsequent survey estimated wind gusts on the island reached 226¬†)Tj
T*(km/h \(140¬†mph\). Heavy rainfall occurred during Sudal's passage, including 20.0¬†)Tj
T*(cm \(7.88¬†inches\) in a 48¬†hour period at the airport. The lowest pressure on the )Tj
T*(island was 958.5¬†mbar \(28.30¬†inHg\). Along the coast, the typhoon produced waves )Tj
T*(of 6.7¬†m \(22¬†ft\) in height, along with a 3.7¬†m \(12¬†ft\) storm surge;[3] the )Tj
T*(combination sunk several ships and heavily damaged the island's coral reefs, )Tj
T*(the latter which is one of Yap's primary tourism attractions.[3][11] )Tj
T*( When Typhoon Sudal struck the island, there were about 8,000¬†people were )Tj
T*(living on Yap, with about 1,700¬†houses. The typhoon destroyed 700¬†homes, and )Tj
T*(left another 900¬†damaged; many of the destroyed homes were wooden. Damage was )Tj
T*(heaviest in the southeastern portion of the island,[3] including in and around )Tj
T*(Colonia, the capital city.[12] The strong winds downed trees across the )Tj
T*(island.[13] Over 90% of the structures on the island were damaged or destroyed, )Tj

T*(typhoon's passage, about 1,000¬†people were left homeless, and another 500 were )Tj
T*(forced to stay in shelters.[3] )Tj
T*( Overall damage from Typhoon Sudal totaled about $14¬†million \(2004¬†USD, $16.1¬†)Tj
T*(million 2010¬†USD\), most of which on Yap from property damage. Despite the heavy )Tj
T*(damage, there were no deaths,[3] although there were initial reports of one )Tj

T*(none of them serious.[1] Typhoon Sudal was the strongest typhoon to strike Yap )Tj
T*(in about 50¬†years.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aftermath )Tj
T*( Following the passage of Sudal, officials in Yap declared a state of )Tj
T*(emergency,[15] and a day after the typhoon struck, United States President )Tj
T*(George W. Bush ordered federal disaster aid for the FSM. The latter declaration )Tj
T*(provided funding for 75% of the debris removal cost and emergency services.[16] )Tj
T*(Less than a week after the storm, the Pacific Islands Forum provided $11,500 to )Tj
T*(Yap for relief efforts.[17] Over the subsequent weeks, the FSM government )Tj
T*(established a typhoon relief fund of about $250,000. Additionally, the United )Tj
T*(States government allocated $7,443,000 for relief efforts.[14] )Tj
T*( Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \(FEMA\) identified )Tj
T*(primary concerns for the small island, including fixing the water supply, )Tj
T*(distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, )Tj
T*(the water supply was rapidly diminishing;[15] more than 80% of the islanders )Tj
T*(were without clean water, and the water from the treatment plant needed to be )Tj
T*(boiled for extended periods of time.[18] Health issues included dehydration, )Tj
T*(sickness, and gastrointestinal problems.[15] Without running water, several )Tj
T*(people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which )Tj
T*(caused skin irritations.[11] )Tj
T*( Initially, telephone service onto the island was disrupted, and the only )Tj
T*(method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam )Tj
T*(Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes )Tj
T*(containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway.[19] )Tj
T*(About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and repaired, which )Tj
T*(allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including )Tj
T*(building materials.[12] By April¬†12, or three days after the typhoon, )Tj
T*(communication links to the island began to be restored.[13] By four days later, )Tj
T*(the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was )Tj
T*(repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% )Tj
T*(of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely )Tj
T*(cleared, and all bridges were reopened.[11] )Tj
T*( About two weeks after the typhoon's passage, there were still 500¬†people in 18¬†)Tj
T*(shelters in Colonia, the capital city, as well as about 400¬†people in shelters )Tj
T*(elsewhere.[20] Many others were either residing with relatives or staying at )Tj
T*(their damaged properties.[21] The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived )Tj
T*(on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent )Tj
T*(23¬†flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of )Tj
T*(Ulithi and Fais. About 76,000¬†litres \(20,000¬†gallons\) of water were sent to the )Tj
T*(island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States )Tj
T*(Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief )Tj
T*(supplies.[20] The Yap hospital was poorly suited to handle the typhoon, due to )Tj
T*(the lack of medications or emergency medical equipment. About 60¬†FEMA personnel )Tj
T*(worked at the hospital, who required additional items, such as their own supply )Tj
T*(of water and food, to prevent them from acquiring local diseases. During their )Tj
T*(stay on the island, the group assisted 163¬†people, mostly for minor issues.[8] )Tj
T*(Overall, there were about 100¬†FEMA workers involved on the island, although )Tj
T*(only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and rental cars.[21] )Tj
T*( By 26¬†days after the storm, more than half of the island had power restored, )Tj
T*(and the cell phone system was fixed.[14] In the weeks and months after the )Tj
T*(passage of Sudal, water temperatures around Yap decreased from 30 ¬∞C \(86¬†¬∞F\) to )Tj
T*(24 ¬∞C \(75¬†¬∞F\), due to significant upwelling. The drastic decrease caused )Tj

T*(Power and water lines were completely restored. The hospital remained damaged )Tj
T*(with a temporary roof, and although private businesses quickly re-opened, )Tj

T*(the use and display of the national flag. These have been relaxed to allow )Tj
T*(citizens to fly the flag from vehicles during national holidays and from homes )Tj
T*(at any time of the year. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( Singapore was under British rule in the 19th century, having been amalgamated )Tj
T*(into the Straits Settlements together with Malacca and Penang. The flag that )Tj
T*(was used to represent the Settlements was a British Blue Ensign containing )Tj
T*(three gold crowns‚Äîone for each settlement‚Äîseparated by a red inverted pall, )Tj
T*(which resembles an inverted Y.[1] The Settlement of Singapore had no separate )Tj
T*(flag, although the city was granted a coat of arms which featured a lion in )Tj
T*(1911. During the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese during the Second )Tj
T*(World War, the Japanese national flag \(also called the Nissh≈çki[2] or the )Tj
T*(Hinomaru[3]\) was used on land by the military and during public events.[4] Soon )Tj
T*(after the Second World War, Singapore became an independent Crown colony and )Tj
T*(adopted its own flag. It was modified from the Straits Settlements flag to )Tj
T*(reduce the number of crowns from three to one.[5][6] )Tj
T*( Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire on 3 June 1959.[7] )Tj
T*(Six months later, upon the installation of the new Yang di-Pertuan Negara \(head )Tj
T*(of state\) on 3 December 1959, the national flag was officially adopted, along )Tj
T*(with the state coat of arms and the national anthem Majulah Singapura \("Onward )Tj
T*(Singapore"\).[8] Then-Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye discussed the creation )Tj
T*(of the national flag in a 1989 interview: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*([A]lthough we were self governing it was necessary right from the beginning )Tj
T*(that we should rally enough different races together as a Singapore nation... )Tj
T*([A]part from the anthem we have to produce the flag and the crest, we insisted )Tj
T*(that it was a Singapore state flag and should be flown side by side with the )Tj
T*(Union Jack.[8])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The design of the flag was completed in two months by a committee headed by )Tj
T*(Toh. He initially wanted the flag's entire background to be red, but the )Tj
T*(Cabinet decided against this, as red was regarded as a rallying point for )Tj
T*(communism.[9] Also, Indonesia, Poland and Monaco already had plain red and )Tj
T*(white flags. According to an account given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese )Tj
T*(population wanted five stars, which were modeled off the flag of the People's )Tj
T*(Republic of China and the Muslim population wanted a crescent moon. Both of )Tj
T*(these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.[10][11] )Tj
T*( On 30 November 1959, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem )Tj
T*(Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of the State Arms and )Tj
T*(State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem.[12] When presenting the )Tj
T*(motion to the Legislative Assembly of Singapore on 11 November 1959, )Tj
T*(Sinnathamby Rajaratnam, the Minister for Culture, stated: "National flags, )Tj
T*(crest and anthem express symbolically the hopes and ideals of a people... The )Tj
T*(possession of a national flag and crest is, for a people, symbolic of )Tj
T*(self-respect."[13] In September 1962, the people of Singapore voted to join the )Tj
T*(Federation of Malaysia. The process was formally completed on 16 September )Tj
T*(1963, when the Malaysian flag was hoisted on Singapore by Prime Minister Lee )Tj

T*(Kuan Yew.[14] The Singapore flag was reconfirmed as the national flag when )Tj
T*(Singapore became fully independent from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Design )Tj
T*( The Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules define the flag's )Tj
T*(composition and the symbolism of its elements: red symbolises "universal )Tj
T*(brotherhood and equality of man", and white, "pervading and everlasting purity )Tj
T*(and virtue". The waxing crescent moon "represents a young nation on the )Tj
T*(ascendant". The five stars "stand for the nation's ideals of democracy, peace, )Tj
T*(progress, justice and equality".[16][17] During the second half of the 20th )Tj
T*(century, the star and crescent¬†symbol came to be recognized as a symbol of )Tj
T*(Islamism, and Singapore's flag came to be seen in this context by the nation's )Tj
T*(Muslim activists.[18] )Tj
T*( The ratio of the flag is two units high by three units wide. For the )Tj
T*(manufacturing of flags, the Government of Singapore stated that the shade of )Tj
T*(red used on the flag is Pantone 032.[19] According to guidelines published by )Tj
T*(the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts \(MICA\), the flag may )Tj
T*(be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, but it must be in its )Tj
T*(specified proportions and colours.[20] MICA recommends the sizes 915 by 1,370¬†)Tj
T*(mm \(approx. 36 by 54¬†in\), 1,220 by 1,830¬†mm \(approx. 48 by 72¬†in\), and 1,830 by )Tj
T*(2,740¬†mm \(approx. 72 by 108¬†in\).[21] The material that is recommended for the )Tj
T*(national flag is bunting wool.[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Regulations and guidelines )Tj
T*( Until 2004, the flag was used exclusively on or in front of buildings owned by )Tj
T*(the government, ministries, statutory boards and educational institutions on a )Tj
T*(year round basis.[22] The flag could only be flown by individuals and )Tj
T*(non-governmental organisations during the month of August to mark the country's )Tj
T*(national day on 9 August.[21] During the National Day celebrations period \(1 )Tj
T*(July‚Äî30 September\), rules governing the flying of the national flag outside )Tj
T*(buildings are relaxed.[23] The flag may be displayed on any vehicle \(other than )Tj
T*(a hearse\), vessel or aircraft,[24] and may be incorporated as part of any )Tj
T*(costume or attire, so long as this is done in a respectful manner.[25] )Tj
T*( These restrictions on individuals and non-governmental organisations were )Tj
T*(relaxed in 2004 to allow the flag to be flown year-round under certain )Tj
T*(conditions. A statement from the Ministry of Information and the Arts \(now )Tj
T*(MICA, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts\) said that )Tj
T*("[t]he national flag, national anthem and Singapore lion head... are our most )Tj
T*(visible symbols of our sovereignty, pride and honour" and urged Singaporeans to )Tj
T*(use those "rallying" symbols to "identify with the nation".[26] No rationale )Tj
T*(was provided for the changes, although BBC News correspondents noted that the )Tj
T*(government had recently been trying to rally patriotic sentiment dampened by )Tj
T*(economic issues. \(In 2003, unemployment in Singapore reached a 17-year-high of )Tj
T*(5.9%, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome \(SARS\) epidemic in East Asia )Tj
T*(seriously affected the island's tourist trade, causing Singapore Airlines to )Tj
T*(suffer a financial loss for the first time in its history.\)[26] )Tj
T*( Following requests by Singaporeans, guidelines for the use of the flag were )Tj
T*(further broadened in 2006 to give residents a variety of opportunities to )Tj
T*(express their loyalty to Singapore during National Day celebrations such as the )Tj
T*(National Day Parade. MICA permitted them to display the flag on vehicles and on )Tj
T*(themselves or belongings with minimal restrictions, from the middle of July to )Tj
T*(the end of August for a trial period.[27] The period was extended in 2007 to )Tj
T*(three months from July to September.[20][28] )Tj
T*( Singaporean citizens, government and non-governmental organisations may )Tj
T*(display or fly the national flag throughout the year to identify themselves )Tj
T*(with the nation, and especially encouraged to do so during occasions of )Tj
T*(national celebration or national significance.[20] Non-Singaporean businesses )Tj
T*(and organisations are also allowed to display the flag throughout the year.[29] )Tj
T*(The use and display of the flag is governed by Part III of the Singapore Arms )Tj
T*(and Flag and National Anthem Rules[16] made under the Singapore Arms and Flag )Tj
T*(and National Anthem Act.[30] It is an offence to knowingly contravene specified )Tj
T*(provisions of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules; the )Tj

T*(penalty is a fine not exceeding S$1,000.[31] )Tj
T*( The Singaporean government dictates that no person may treat the national flag )Tj
T*(with disrespect,[32] such as allowing the flag to touch the ground.[33] The )Tj
T*(flag must not be displayed below any other flag, emblem or object;[34] dipped )Tj
T*(in salute to any person or thing;[35] or displayed or carried flat or )Tj
T*(horizontally, but always aloft and free.[36] )Tj
T*( Within Singapore, the national flag takes precedence over all other flags, )Tj
T*(subject to international practice.[37] As such, when it is displayed or flown )Tj
T*(with other flags, it must be in a position of honour; that is, it should be )Tj
T*(positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side )Tj
T*(by side with other flags on the same level, to the left of the other flags \(as )Tj
T*(seen by a person facing the flags\).[38] When the flag is raised or carried in a )Tj
T*(procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in )Tj
T*(a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are )Tj
T*(carried side by side[39] \(i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer\). The )Tj
T*(standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.[40] When )Tj
T*(the flag is displayed on a platform or stage, it must be above all decorations )Tj
T*(and be behind and above any person speaking from the platform or stage. If it )Tj
T*(is displayed from a staff standing on the platform or stage, it must be on the )Tj
T*(right side of the person speaking from the platform or stage.[41] Finally, when )Tj
T*(the flag is hung, it must be hung against a vertical wall or other vertical )Tj
T*(flat surface, with the crescent and stars on the top left position as seen by )Tj
T*(any spectator facing the flag and the wall or surface.[42] )Tj
T*( When the flag is displayed outside a building, it shall be displayed on or in )Tj
T*(front of the building only from a flagpole.[43] If the flag is flown at night, )Tj
T*(it should be properly illuminated.[44] The flag must not be displayed on any )Tj
T*(motor vehicle except on one in which the President of Singapore or any )Tj
T*(Government minister is travelling on official business.[45] The flag may not be )Tj
T*(displayed on any private vessel or aircraft.[46] No person may use or apply the )Tj
T*(flag or any image of it for any commercial purposes or as part of any )Tj
T*(furnishing, decoration, covering or receptacle,[47] except in such )Tj
T*(circumstances as may be approved \(by MICA\) in which there is no disrespect for )Tj
T*(the flag.[48] Further, it is not permitted to use the flag as part of any )Tj
T*(trademark,[49] or to produce or display any flag which bears any graphics or )Tj
T*(word superimposed on the design of the national flag.[50] The flag or any image )Tj
T*(of it may also not be used or applied as or as part of any costume or )Tj
T*(attire.[51] )Tj
T*( The Government may ask for the flag to be lowered to half-mast in the event of )Tj
T*(the death of an important person or for national mourning.[52] No person is )Tj
T*(permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony.[53] However, the )Tj
T*(national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral.[54] )Tj
T*(No person may display any flag that is damaged or dirty.[55] Any worn out or )Tj
T*(damaged flag should be packed into a sealed black trash bag before being )Tj
T*(disposed and not left visible in dustbins.[20] )Tj
T*( [edit] Use of the national flag )Tj
T*( [edit] During National Day celebrations )Tj
T*( Singaporeans are encouraged to display the national flag outside their homes )Tj
T*(during National Day celebrations, and residents' committees, particularly those )Tj
T*(of public housing estates, often arrange co-ordinated displays. However, some )Tj
T*(Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the People's Action )Tj
T*(Party, the ruling party in Parliament, rather than with the nation.[56] )Tj
T*( On National Day in 2007 at the Padang, 8,667 volunteers holding up red and )Tj
T*(white umbrellas formed the largest-ever representation of Singapore's flag at )Tj
T*(an event organised by Young NTUC, a youth movement associated with the National )Tj
T*(Trades Union Congress.[57] )Tj
T*( [edit] At other times )Tj
T*( Outside the National Day celebrations period, the national flag of Singapore )Tj
T*(is flown from all buildings housing government and government-related )Tj
T*(departments, such as armed forces installations, court houses, offices, and )Tj
T*(educational institutions. A picture of the flag is commonly found in each )Tj

T*(classroom, and schools conduct ceremonies at the beginning and the end of the )Tj
T*(school day at which the national flag is raised and lowered, the national )Tj
T*(anthem is sung and the national pledge is taken.[58] )Tj
T*( The national flag is sometimes flown by Singapore-registered vessels, although )Tj
T*(this is considered incorrect, as such vessels are required to hoist proper )Tj
T*(national colours either when entering or leaving port.[59] The ensign is red )Tj
T*(and charged with a circle enclosing a crescent surmounted by five stars in a )Tj
T*(circle, all in white.[60] The national flag is not used by coast guard ships )Tj
T*(and military warships; both classes of ships have their own specific ensigns. )Tj
T*( The Singapore Government makes announcements regarding the lowering of the )Tj
T*(flag to half-mast in the event of a death of an important personage or mourning )Tj
T*(affecting the nation.[61] The flag has been flown at half-mast during the )Tj
T*(funerals of former presidents and senior politicians,[62] and on 9 January 2005 )Tj
T*(as a mark of respect for those who perished in the 2004 Asian Tsunami )Tj
T*(disaster.[63] )Tj
T*( [edit] In culture )Tj
T*( Singaporean composer Lim Su Chong composed a song in 1969 entitled Five Stars )Tj
T*(Arising which took the elements of the national flag as its theme. The lyrics )Tj
T*(of the song speak of a new moon, five stars and a new flag "arising out of the )Tj
T*(stormy sea". The moon is "[y]outhful and bright and bearing hope, and tranquil )Tj
T*(as can be", each of the stars is "a lamp to guide our way; a lamp for all to )Tj
T*(see" and the flag is "[c]rimson as the blood of all mankind, yet white and pure )Tj
T*(and free".[64] The song is often sung during National Day celebrations. )Tj
T*( In January 2003, Singaporean artist Justin Lee Chee Kong was prevented by the )Tj
T*(Media Development Authority \(MDA\) from exhibiting a painting entitled Double )Tj
T*(Happiness‚Äî A Fantasy in Red, which consisted of an image of the Singapore flag )Tj
T*(with various red images of the Chinese characters for double happiness. The )Tj
T*(move was made on the grounds that "the National Flag is a national symbol and )Tj
T*(no words or graphics should be superimposed on it". Lee reported that the work )Tj
T*(was simply a display of one's love for their country and an expression of joy )Tj
T*(at Singapore's success, and in a press statement, he asked that the piece be )Tj
T*("treated as an artistic and complimentary interpretation of a national icon". )Tj
T*(When interviewed by The New Paper, he said "I know as a citizen that we are not )Tj
T*(allowed to do it, but this is art and I am an artist."[65] He also complained )Tj
T*(about double standards as a Chinese artist, Gu Wen Da, had recently exhibited a )Tj
T*(national flag made of hair at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. Lee felt the )Tj
T*(use of hair to create the nation's flag meant that the flag was in the wrong )Tj
T*(colours, and was distasteful.[65] Also in 2003, The Rolling Stones performed in )Tj
T*(Singapore as part of their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first )Tj
T*(performance, there were two inflatable dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had )Tj
T*(flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the )Tj
T*(other had a Singapore flag.[66] Because of the illegal use of the state flag, )Tj
T*(and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were )Tj
T*(removed from the second concert by the organizer.[67] )Tj
T*( In August 2007, a Singaporean pub, Loof, sent an electronic direct mailer )Tj
T*(\(e-flyer\)[68] to at least 1,500 members on its mailing list featuring a )Tj
T*(close-up shot of the crotch of a female model wearing a red swimsuit or pair of )Tj
T*(underpants bearing the crescent and five stars of the national flag. This was )Tj
T*(done as part of the pub's publicity campaign for its National Day events. )Tj
T*(According to Loof's marketing manager, "[T]he ad was definitely not meant as an )Tj
T*(insult to the country or anyone. I hope that the ad will be taken in the spirit )Tj
T*(of humour and fun." A majority of people polled by The New Paper felt the )Tj
T*(advertisement was disrespectful and in bad taste. MICA said that the )Tj
T*(advertisement did not breach the law as it only reproduced some components of )Tj
T*(the flag‚Äîit did not, for example, incorporate the flag's red and white )Tj
T*(background together. However, K.U. Menon, director of MICA's National )Tj
T*(Resilience Division, said: "MICA does not encourage such ads which treat the )Tj
T*(national flag with disrespect. [...] Symbols should be treated with some )Tj
T*(measure of dignity and we hope Loof will withdraw the ad on its own )Tj
T*(initiative."[69] )Tj

T*(insulting and an embarrassment to the country, with the crescent moon )Tj
T*(positioned in the center of the brief, directly over the crotch area. The )Tj
T*(garment had been designed by the team itself[71] but had not received prior )Tj
T*(approval from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts. )Tj
T*(However, even after the controversy came to light, the team was still able to )Tj
T*(continue wearing it as competition rules did not permit changing a team's )Tj
T*(uniform midway through the Games. The team was apologetic over the blunder and )Tj
T*(promised to tweak the design after that competition. )Tj
T*( [edit] Other flags of Singapore )Tj
T*( In addition to the national flag and ensigns, there are other flags used for )Tj
T*(official purposes. )Tj
T*(Flag)Tj
T*(Description)Tj
T*(The standard used by the President of Singapore is a modification of the )Tj
T*(national flag. The crescent and the stars are bigger and centred on a field of )Tj
T*(red.[72] According to the Istana, the Office of the President of Singapore, the )Tj
T*(red background and the crescent and stars have the same symbolism as in the )Tj
T*(national flag. The standard is flown at the Istana from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, or )Tj
T*(until the President has left for his private residence.[73])Tj
T*(The Red Ensign of Singapore, which is used for Singapore-registered civilian )Tj
T*(ships, is a red flag charged with a crescent and five stars, surrounded by a )Tj
T*(ring. The ratio of the width to the length of the ensign is one to two. )Tj
T*(According to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore \(MPA\), this ensign )Tj
T*(should be used on Singapore ships instead of the national flag. In a 1999 )Tj
T*(marine circular, the MPA reminded masters, owners and officers of ships that )Tj
T*(those who do not use the Red Ensign risk being fined under the Merchant )Tj
T*(Shipping Act \(Cap.¬†179, 1996 ¬†Rev. Ed.\).[60])Tj
T*(The Singapore Naval Force Ensign was introduced in 1967 by the Ministry of )Tj
T*(Defence, and is used on all vessels owned by the Republic of Singapore Navy )Tj
T*(\(RSN\). According to a construction sheet issued by the Ministry entitled )Tj
T*(Singapore Naval Force Ensign and numbered Misc. 1 of 1967: "The Singapore Naval )Tj
T*(Force Ensign shall be a white ensign with the top left hand quarter of red )Tj
T*(charged with a crescent sided by five stars in a circle all in white and an )Tj
T*(eight pointed red star with narrow white lines inserted within the star in the )Tj
T*(lower right hand quarter. The ratio of the width to the length of ensign shall )Tj
T*(be one by two. The crescent and stars are from the State Flag and the eight )Tj
T*(pointed star represents the mariner's compass."[74][75][76] This ensign )Tj
T*(formally replaced the Blue Ensign \(now used by non-military government )Tj
T*(ships\)[77] during a ceremony at Telok Ayer Basin.[77])Tj
T*(The State Marine Ensign was created in 1960 and is used on all non-military )Tj
T*(vessels owned by the government, such as the Coast Guard. According to a )Tj
T*(construction sheet issued by the Ministry of Defence entitled State Marine )Tj
T*(Ensign and numbered Misc. 6 of 1960: "The State Marine Ensign shall be a blue )Tj
T*(ensign with the top left hand quarter of red charged with a crescent sided by )Tj
T*(five stars in a circle all in white and an eight pointed red and white star in )Tj
T*(the lower right hand quarter. The ratio of the width to the length of ensign )Tj
T*(shall be one to two. The colour blue is symbolic of the sea, the crescent and )Tj
T*(stars are from the State Flag and the eight pointed star represents the )Tj

T*( David Alexander Johnston \(December 18, 1949 ‚Äì May 18, 1980\) was an American )Tj
T*(volcanologist with the United States Geological Survey \(USGS\) who was killed by )Tj
T*(the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington. One of the principal )Tj
T*(scientists on the monitoring team, Johnston died while manning an observation )Tj
T*(post about 6 miles \(10 km\) from the volcano on the morning of May 18, 1980. He )Tj
T*(was the first to report the eruption, transmitting the message "Vancouver! )Tj
T*(Vancouver! This is it!" before being swept away by the lateral blast created by )Tj
T*(the collapse of the mountain's north flank. Though Johnston's remains have )Tj
T*(never been found, remnants of his USGS trailer were found by state highway )Tj
T*(workers in 1993. )Tj
T*( Johnston's comprehensive, although truncated, career took him across the )Tj
T*(United States, where he studied Augustine Volcano in Alaska, the San Juan )Tj
T*(volcanic field in Colorado, and long-extinct volcanoes in Michigan. Johnston )Tj
T*(was a meticulous and talented scientist who was known for his analyses of )Tj
T*(volcanic gases and their relationship to eruptions. This, along with his )Tj
T*(enthusiasm and positive attitude, made him liked and respected by many of his )Tj
T*(co-workers. After his death, other scientists lauded his character both )Tj
T*(verbally and in dedications and letters. Johnston felt that scientists must do )Tj
T*(what is necessary, including taking risks, to help protect the public from )Tj
T*(natural disasters. His work and that of his fellow USGS scientists convinced )Tj
T*(the authorities to close Mount St. Helens to the general public before the 1980 )Tj
T*(eruption, and to maintain the closure in spite of heavy pressure to re-open the )Tj
T*(area; their work saved thousands of lives. His story has become part of the )Tj
T*(popular image of volcanic eruptions and their threat to society, and also part )Tj
T*(of the history of volcanology. To date, Johnston is one of just two American )Tj
T*(volcanologists known to have been killed in volcanic eruptions. )Tj
T*( Following his death, Johnston was commemorated in several ways, including a )Tj
T*(memorial fund set up in his name at the University of Washington to fund )Tj
T*(graduate-level research. Two volcano observatories were established and named )Tj
T*(after him: one in Vancouver, Washington, and the other on the ridge where he )Tj
T*(died. Johnston's life and death have been featured in several documentaries, )Tj
T*(films, docudramas and books about the eruption. Along with other people killed )Tj
T*(by the volcano, Johnston's name is inscribed on memorials dedicated to their )Tj
T*(memory. )Tj

T*(grew up with one sister. His father worked as an engineer at a local company )Tj
T*(and his mother as a newspaper editor. Johnston often took photographs for his )Tj
T*(mother's newspaper and contributed articles to his school's newspaper. He never )Tj
T*(married.[1] )Tj
T*( After graduating from high school, Johnston attended the University of )Tj
T*(Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He planned to study journalism, but became )Tj
T*(discouraged after a poor grade in a large lecture class. He was intrigued by an )Tj
T*(introductory geology class, and changed his major.[1] His first geologic )Tj
T*(project was a study of the Precambrian rock that forms Michigan's Upper )Tj
T*(Peninsula. There he investigated the remains of an ancient volcano: a suite of )Tj
T*(metamorphosed basalts, a gabbroic sill, and volcanic roots in the form of a )Tj
T*(dioritic and gabbroic intrusion. The experience planted the seed of Johnston's )Tj
T*(passion for volcanoes. After working hard to learn the subject,[1] he graduated )Tj
T*(with "Highest Honors and Distinction" in 1971.[3][4] )Tj
T*( Johnston spent the summer after college in the San Juan volcanic field of )Tj
T*(Colorado working with volcanologist Pete Lipman in his study of two extinct )Tj
T*(calderas.[1][3] This work became the inspiration for the first phase of his )Tj
T*(graduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle, in which he focused )Tj
T*(on the Oligocene Cimarron andesitic volcanic complex in the western San )Tj
T*(Juans.[3][5] Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct )Tj
T*(volcanoes prepared him to study active volcanoes.[3] Johnston's first )Tj
T*(experience with active volcanoes was a geophysical survey of Mount Augustine in )Tj
T*(Alaska in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to )Tj
T*(Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a master's )Tj
T*(thesis, and making Mount Augustine the focus of his Ph.D. work. He graduated in )Tj
T*(1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that \(1\) the emplacement mechanism of the )Tj
T*(pyroclastic flows had changed over time, as they became less pumaceous, \(2\) the )Tj
T*(magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and )Tj
T*(\(3\) underground mixing of the felsic \(silicic\) magmas with less-viscous mafic )Tj
T*(\(basaltic\) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the )Tj
T*(site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on the )Tj
T*(mountain during an eruption after high winds grounded the first two evacuation )Tj
T*(aircraft.[6] )Tj
T*( During the summers of 1978 and 1979, Johnston led studies of the ash-flow )Tj
T*(sheet emplaced in the 1912 eruption of Mount Katmai in the Valley of Ten )Tj
T*(Thousand Smokes.[3] The gas phase is extremely important in propelling volcanic )Tj
T*(eruptions. Because of this, Johnston mastered the many techniques required to )Tj
T*(analyze glass-vapor inclusions in phenocrysts embedded in lavas, which provide )Tj
T*(information about gases present during past eruptions. His work at Mount Katmai )Tj
T*(and other volcanoes in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes paved the way for his )Tj
T*(career, and his "agility, nerve, patience, and determination around the )Tj
T*(jet-like summit fumaroles in the crater of Mt. Mageik" impressed his )Tj
T*(colleagues.[3] )Tj
T*( Later in 1978, Johnston joined the United States Geological Survey \(USGS\), )Tj
T*(where he monitored volcanic emission levels in the Cascades and Aleutian Arc. )Tj
T*(There he helped to strengthen the theory that eruptions can be predicted, to )Tj
T*(some degree, by changes in the makeup of volcanic gases.[7] Fellow )Tj
T*(volcanologist Wes Hildreth said of Johnston, "I think Dave's dearest hope was )Tj
T*(that systematic monitoring of fumarolic emissions might permit detection of )Tj
T*(changes characteristically precursory to eruptions¬†... Dave wanted to formulate )Tj
T*(a general model for the behavior of magmatic volatiles prior to explosive )Tj
T*(outbursts and to develop a corollary rationale for the evaluation of )Tj
T*(hazards."[3] During this time, Johnston continued to visit Mount Augustine )Tj
T*(every summer and also assessed the geothermal energy potential of the Azores )Tj
T*(and Portugal. In the last year of his life, Johnston developed an interest in )Tj
T*(the health, agricultural, and environmental effects of both volcanic and )Tj
T*(anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere.[3] )Tj
T*( Johnston was based at the Menlo Park, California, branch of the USGS, but his )Tj
T*(work on volcanoes took him all over the Pacific Northwest region. When the )Tj
T*(first earthquakes shook Mount St. Helens on March 16, 1980, Johnston was nearby )Tj

T*(at the University of Washington, where he had pursued his doctorate. Intrigued )Tj
T*(by the possible advent of an eruption, Johnston contacted Stephen Malone, a )Tj
T*(professor of geology at the university. Malone had been his mentor when )Tj
T*(Johnston had worked at the San Juan complex in Colorado, and Johnston admired )Tj
T*(his work.[1] Malone stated that he "put him to work" almost instantly, allowing )Tj
T*(Johnston to escort interested reporters to a place near the volcano.[8] )Tj
T*(Johnston was the first geologist on the volcano,[3] and soon became a leader )Tj
T*(within the USGS team, taking charge of monitoring of volcanic gas emissions.[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Eruption )Tj
T*( [edit] Precursor activity )Tj
T*( Since its last eruptive activity in the mid-19th century, Mount St. Helens had )Tj
T*(been largely dormant. Seismographs were not installed until 1972. This period )Tj
T*(of more than 100 years of inactivity ended in early 1980. On March 15, a )Tj
T*(cluster of tiny earthquakes rocked the area around the mountain. For six days, )Tj
T*(more than 100 earthquakes clustered around Mount St. Helens, an indication that )Tj
T*(magma was moving. There was initially some doubt as to whether the earthquakes )Tj
T*(were precursors to an eruption.[9] By March 20, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake )Tj
T*(shook the wilderness around the volcano. The next day, seismologists installed )Tj
T*(three seismic recorder stations.[10] By March 24, volcanologists at the )Tj
T*(USGS‚Äîincluding Johnston‚Äîbecame more confident that the seismic activity was a )Tj
T*(sign of an impending eruption. After March 25, seismic activity drastically )Tj
T*(increased. By March 26, more than seven earthquakes over magnitude 4.0 had been )Tj
T*(recorded, and the next day, hazard warnings were publicly issued.[9] On March )Tj
T*(27, a phreatic eruption took place, ejecting a plume of ash nearly 7,000 feet )Tj
T*(\(2,134¬†m\) into the air.[9] )Tj
T*( Similar activity continued at the volcano over the following weeks, excavating )Tj
T*(the crater, forming an adjacent caldera, and erupting small amounts of steam, )Tj
T*(ash, and tephra. With each new eruption, the plumes of steam and ash from the )Tj
T*(volcano rose, eventually climbing to 20,000 feet \(6,000¬†m\). By late March, the )Tj
T*(volcano was erupting up to 100 times per day.[11] Spectators congregated in the )Tj
T*(vicinity of the mountain, hoping for a chance to see its eruptions. They were )Tj
T*(joined by reporters on helicopters, as well as mountain climbers.[11] )Tj
T*( On April 17, a bulge was discovered on the mountain's north flank, suggesting )Tj
T*(that Mount St. Helens could produce a lateral blast.[12] Johnston was one of )Tj
T*(few people who believed this, along with a professor of geology at a Tacoma )Tj
T*(community college, Jack Hyde. Observing that Mount St. Helens did not possess )Tj
T*(visible vents, Hyde suggested that pressure would increase until the mountain )Tj
T*(exploded. Because Hyde was not a part of the USGS or in a position of )Tj
T*(responsibility, his opinion was generally dismissed.[13] However, both were to )Tj
T*(be proven correct. Rising magma under Mount St. Helens had veered off to the )Tj
T*(north flank, creating a growing bulge on the surface.[12] )Tj
T*( [edit] Final signs and primary blast )Tj
T*( Given the increasing seismic and volcanic activity, Johnston and the other )Tj
T*(volcanologists working for the USGS in its Vancouver branch prepared to observe )Tj
T*(any impending eruption. Geologist Don Swanson and others placed reflectors on )Tj
T*(and around the growing domes,[14] and established the Coldwater¬†I and II )Tj
T*(observation posts to use laser ranging to measure how the distances to these )Tj
T*(reflectors changed over time as the domes deformed. Coldwater¬†II, where )Tj
T*(Johnston died, was located just 6 miles \(10¬†km\) north of the mountain. To the )Tj
T*(astonishment of the USGS geologists, the bulge was growing at a rate of 5 to 8 )Tj
T*(feet \(1.5 to 2.4 meters\) per day.[15] )Tj
T*( Tiltmeters installed on the volcano's north side displayed a northwest )Tj
T*(trending tilt for that side of the mountain, and a southwest trending tilt was )Tj
T*(observed on the south side. Worried that the amount of pressure on the magma )Tj
T*(underground was increasing, scientists analyzed gases by the crater, and found )Tj
T*(high traces of sulfur dioxide. After this discovery, they began to regularly )Tj
T*(check the fumarolic activity and monitor the volcano for dramatic changes, but )Tj
T*(none were observed. Disheartened, they instead opted to study the growing bulge )Tj
T*(and the threat an avalanche could have for humans relatively near the )Tj

T*(landslide or avalanche in the Toutle River could spawn lahars, or mudflows, )Tj
T*(downstream.[12] )Tj
T*( At that point, the previously consistent phreatic activity had become )Tj
T*(intermittent. Between May 10 and May 17, the only change occurred on the )Tj
T*(volcano's north flank, as the bulge increased in size. On May 16 and 17, the )Tj
T*(mountain stopped its phreatic eruptions completely.[16] )Tj
T*( The active Mount St. Helens was extremely different from its dormant form, now )Tj
T*(featuring an enormous bulge and several craters. In the week preceding the )Tj
T*(eruption, cracks formed in the north sector of the volcano's summit, indicating )Tj
T*(a movement of magma from the bulge and towards the caldera.[16] )Tj
T*( At 8:32 a.m. local time the next day \(18 May\), an earthquake measuring )Tj
T*(magnitude 5.1 on the Richter scale rocked the area, triggering the landslide )Tj
T*(that started the main eruption. In a matter of seconds, vibrations from the )Tj
T*(earthquake loosened 2.7 cubic kilometers \(0.6¬†cu¬†mi\) of rock on the mountain's )Tj
T*(north face and summit, creating a massive landslide. With the loss of the )Tj
T*(confining pressure of the overlying rock, the caldera of Mount St. Helens began )Tj
T*(to rapidly emit steam and other volcanic gases. A few seconds later, it erupted )Tj
T*(laterally, sending swift pyroclastic flows down its flanks at near supersonic )Tj
T*(speeds. These flows were later joined by lahars.[17] Before being struck by a )Tj
T*(series of flows that, at their fastest, would have taken less than a minute to )Tj
T*(reach his position, Johnston managed to radio "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is )Tj
T*(it!" to his USGS co-workers. Seconds later, the signal from the radio went )Tj
T*(silent.[18] Initially, there was some debate as to whether Johnston had )Tj
T*(survived; records soon showed a radio message from fellow eruption victim and )Tj
T*(amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and )Tj
T*(further north of Johnston's position, reporting his sighting of the eruption )Tj
T*(enveloping the Coldwater¬†II observation post. As the blast overwhelmed )Tj
T*(Johnston's post, Martin declared solemnly, "Gentlemen, the uh, camper and the )Tj
T*(car sitting over to the south of me is covered. It's gonna get me, too. I can't )Tj
T*(get out of here¬†..." before his radio, too, went silent.[19] )Tj
T*( The extent, speed and direction of the avalanche and pyroclastic flows that )Tj
T*(overwhelmed Johnston, Martin, and others were later described in detail in a )Tj
T*(paper titled 'Chronology and Character of the 18 May 1980 Explosive Eruptions )Tj
T*(of Mount St. Helens', published in 1984 in a collection published by the )Tj
T*(National Research Council's Geophysics Study Committee.[20] In this paper, the )Tj
T*(authors examined photographs and satellite images of the eruption to construct )Tj
T*(a chronology and description of the first few minutes. Included in the paper is )Tj
T*(figure 10.3, a series of timed photographs taken from Mount Adams, 33 miles \(53¬†)Tj
T*(km\) east of Mount St. Helens. These six photographs, taken sideways on to the )Tj
T*(lateral blast, vividly show the extent and size of the avalanche and flows as )Tj
T*(they reached northwards over and beyond Johnston's position. Figure 10.7 from )Tj
T*(the same paper is an overhead diagram showing the position of the pyroclastic )Tj
T*(surge front at half-minute intervals, with the positions of Johnston \(Coldwater¬†)Tj
T*(II\) and Martin included.[20] )Tj
T*( The eruption was heard hundreds of miles away,[21] but some of those who )Tj
T*(survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were )Tj
T*(silent as they raced down the mountain. Krau Kilpatrick, an employee of the )Tj
T*(United States Forest Service, recalled, "There was no sound to it, not a sound. )Tj
T*(It was like a silent movie and we were all in it."[22] The reason for this )Tj
T*(discrepancy is a "quiet zone", created as a result of the motion and )Tj
T*(temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography.[21] )Tj
T*( Famous for telling reporters that being on the mountain was like "standing )Tj
T*(next to a dynamite keg and the fuse is lit",[23] Johnston had been among the )Tj
T*(first volcanologists at the volcano when eruptive signs appeared, and shortly )Tj
T*(after was named the head of volcanic gas monitoring. Though a careful analyst, )Tj
T*(Johnston strongly believed that scientists needed to take this risk for )Tj
T*(themselves in order to prevent civilian deaths, and therefore chose to partake )Tj
T*(in dangerous on-site monitoring. He and several other volcanologists prevented )Tj
T*(people from being near the volcano during the few months of pre-eruptive )Tj
T*(activity, and successfully fought pressure to re-open the area.[7] Their work )Tj

T*(kept the death toll at a few tens of individuals, instead of the thousands who )Tj
T*(possibly could have died had the region not been closed off. Johnston supported )Tj
T*(the lateral blast theory: he believed the explosive eruption would be ejected )Tj
T*(sideways out of the volcano, not upward. He also believed that the eruption )Tj
T*(would originate from the bulge. Because of this, he was more aware than most of )Tj
T*(the threat of a north-directed eruption.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] USGS team and rescue efforts )Tj
T*( Many USGS scientists worked on the team monitoring the volcano, but it was )Tj
T*(graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the Coldwater¬†II )Tj
T*(observation post for the two and a half weeks immediately preceding the )Tj
T*(eruption.[24] The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved )Tj
T*(by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the )Tj
T*(University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German )Tj
T*(graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the )Tj
T*(eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his )Tj
T*(place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day.[25] That )Tj
T*(Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the )Tj
T*(mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. )Tj
T*(Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges )Tj
T*(overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said )Tj
T*(that he would stay on the volcano alone.[26] While at Coldwater¬†II, Johnston )Tj
T*(was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption.[27] Just prior )Tj
T*(to his departure, at 7¬†p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13¬Ω hours before the )Tj
T*(eruption, Glicken took a photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post )Tj
T*(trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.[16] )Tj
T*( The following morning, May 18, at 8:32 a.m.,[28] the volcano erupted. )Tj
T*(Immediately, rescue workers were dispatched to the area. The official USGS )Tj
T*(pilot, Lon Stickney, who had been flying the scientists to the mountain, )Tj
T*(conducted the first rescue attempt. He flew his helicopter over the scarred )Tj
T*(remains of trees, valleys, and the Coldwater¬†II observation post ridge, where )Tj
T*(he saw bare rock and uprooted trees. Because he saw no sign of Johnston's )Tj
T*(trailer, Stickney began to panic, becoming "emotionally distraught".[29] )Tj
T*( Frantic and guilt-stricken, Harry Glicken convinced three separate helicopter )Tj
T*(pilots to take him up on flights over the devastated area in a rescue attempt, )Tj
T*(but the eruption had so changed the landscape that they were unable to locate )Tj
T*(any sign of the Coldwater¬†II observation post, which had been swept away and )Tj
T*(buried in the blast. He and the helicopter crew did manage to find a car with )Tj
T*(people in it at a logging camp, but when they landed to attempt an evacuation, )Tj
T*(skin fell off the dead victims' hands.[24] Shortly after the eruption, Don )Tj
T*(Swanson found Johnston's backpack and parka buried in the rubble, but he hid )Tj
T*(the discovery from all but a few people for fear that scavengers \(who were )Tj
T*(already removing and selling souvenirs of victims of the volcano\) would find )Tj
T*(and remove his friend's body or belongings.[30] In 1993, while building a )Tj
T*(9-mile \(14¬†km\) extension of Washington State Route 504 \(also called "Spirit )Tj
T*(Lake Memorial Highway"\) to lead to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, construction )Tj
T*(workers discovered pieces of Johnston's trailer.[31] His body, however, has )Tj
T*(never been recovered.[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Consequences and response )Tj
T*( The public was shocked by the extent of the eruption, which had lowered the )Tj
T*(elevation of the summit by 1,313 feet \(400¬†m\), destroyed 230 square miles \(596¬†)Tj
T*(km2\) of woodland, and spread ash into other states.[33] The lateral blast that )Tj
T*(killed Johnston started at 220 miles per hour \(354¬†km/h\) and accelerated to 670 )Tj
T*(miles per hour \(1,078¬†km/h\).[21] Even USGS scientists were awed. With a )Tj
T*(Volcanic Explosivity Index value of 5, the eruption was catastrophic. More than )Tj
T*(50 people were killed or missing, including Johnston, mountain resident Harry )Tj
T*(Randall Truman, and National Geographic photographer Reid Blackburn.[33] )Tj
T*( The disaster was the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the )Tj
T*(history of the United States of America. A total of 57 people are known to have )Tj

T*( [edit] Scientific )Tj
T*( Johnston, known to his friends as Dave, was commemorated by both his fellow )Tj
T*(scientists and by the government. Known for his diligent and particular nature, )Tj
T*(he was called "an exemplary scientist" by a USGS dedication paper, which also )Tj
T*(described him as "unaffectedly genuine, with an infectious curiosity and )Tj
T*(enthusiasm".[7] He was quick to "dissipate cynicism" and believed that "careful )Tj
T*(evaluation and interpretation" was the best approach to his work.[7] An )Tj
T*(obituary notice for Johnston stated that at the time of his death he had been )Tj
T*("among the leading young volcanologists in the world" and that his "enthusiasm )Tj
T*(and warmth" would be "missed at least as much as his scientific strength".[35] )Tj
T*(Co-worker Andrew Alden states that Johnston had great potential, declaring that )Tj
T*(he "had many friends and a bright future".[36] Following the eruption, Harry )Tj
T*(Glicken and other geologists at the USGS dedicated their work to Johnston.[30] )Tj
T*( Because Johnston was believed to be safe at the Coldwater¬†II observation post, )Tj
T*(the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most )Tj
T*(of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died "doing what he wanted )Tj
T*(to do."[2] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, "Not )Tj
T*(many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son )Tj
T*(did.¬†... He would tell us he may never get rich but he was doing what he )Tj
T*(wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's )Tj
T*(Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see."[2] Dr. Stephen )Tj
T*(Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he "was )Tj
T*(very good at his work".[8] )Tj
T*( Johnston's role in the study of the volcano in the weeks leading up to the )Tj
T*(eruption was acknowledged in 1981 in a chronology of the eruption, published as )Tj
T*(part of the USGS report titled 'The 1980 Eruptions of Mount St. Helens, )Tj
T*(Washington': )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Among the many contributors of data, none was more essential to the systematic )Tj
T*(reconstruction of the events of 1980 at Mount St. Helens than David Johnston, )Tj
T*(to whose memory this report is dedicated. Dave, who was present through all of )Tj
T*(the activity up to the climactic eruption and who lost his life in that )Tj
T*(eruption, provided far more than data. His insights and his thoroughly )Tj
T*(scientific attitude were crucial to the entire effort; they still serve as a )Tj
T*(model for us all.)Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( Since Johnston's death, his field of volcanic eruption prediction has advanced )Tj
T*(significantly, and volcanologists are now able to predict eruptions based on a )Tj
T*(number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in )Tj
T*(advance.[38] Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic )Tj
T*(waves that indicate particular magmatic activity.[39] In particular, )Tj
T*(volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma )Tj
T*(is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a )Tj
T*(proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to )Tj
T*(magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other )Tj
T*(USGS scientists at the Coldwater¬†I and II outposts, have advanced in scale and )Tj
T*(precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist )Tj

T*(meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination )Tj
T*(of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic )Tj
T*(eruptions.[38] )Tj
T*( Despite the deaths of other volcanologists in later eruptions at Mount Unzen )Tj
T*(and Galeras, prediction methods similar to Johnston's allowed scientists to )Tj
T*(convince residents of settlements near the Mount Pinatubo volcano to evacuate, )Tj
T*(preventing thousands of deaths.[36] In addition to his work, Johnston himself )Tj
T*(has become part of the history of volcanic eruptions. With Harry Glicken, he is )Tj
T*(one of two volcanologists from the United States to die in a volcanic )Tj
T*(eruption.[40] Glicken was being mentored by Johnston, who relieved Glicken of )Tj
T*(his watch at the Coldwater¬†II observation post 13 hours before Mount St. Helens )Tj
T*(erupted.[24] Glicken died in 1991, eleven years later, when a pyroclastic flow )Tj
T*(overran him and several others at Mount Unzen in Japan.[40][41] )Tj
T*( [edit] Commemoration )Tj
T*( Early acts of commemoration included two trees that were planted in Tel Aviv, )Tj
T*(Israel,[6] and the renaming of a community center in Johnston's hometown as the )Tj
T*("Johnston Center". These actions were reported in newspapers during the first )Tj
T*(anniversary of the eruption in May 1981.[6][42] )Tj
T*( On the second anniversary of the eruption, the USGS office in Vancouver \(which )Tj
T*(had been permanently established following the 1980 eruption\) was renamed the )Tj
T*(David A. Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory \(CVO\) in his memory.[43] This )Tj
T*(volcano observatory is the one most responsible for monitoring Mount St. )Tj
T*(Helens, and helped to predict all of the volcano's eruptions between 1980 and )Tj
T*(1985.[44] In a 2005 open day, the lobby area of the CVO included a display and )Tj
T*(painting commemorating Johnston.[45] )Tj
T*( Johnston's connections with the University of Washington \(where he had carried )Tj
T*(out his masters and doctoral research\) are remembered by a memorial fund that )Tj
T*(established an endowed graduate-level fellowship within what is now the )Tj
T*(department of Earth and Space Sciences. By the time of the first anniversary of )Tj
T*(his death, the fund had exceeded $30,000. Known as the 'David A. Johnston )Tj
T*(Memorial Fellowship for Research Excellence', a number of awards of this )Tj
T*(fellowship have been made over the years since it was launched.[6][46] )Tj
T*( Following the eruption, the area where the Coldwater¬†II observation post had )Tj
T*(been was sectioned off. Eventually, an observatory was built in the area in )Tj
T*(Johnston's name, and opened in 1997.[47] Located just over 5 miles \(8¬†km\) from )Tj
T*(the north flank of Mount St. Helens, the Johnston Ridge Observatory \(JRO\) )Tj
T*(allows the public to admire the open crater, new activity, and the creations of )Tj
T*(the 1980 eruption, including an extensive basalt field. Part of the Mount St. )Tj
T*(Helens National Volcanic Monument, the JRO was constructed for $10.5 million, )Tj
T*(equipped with monitoring equipment. Visited by thousands of tourists annually, )Tj
T*(it also includes tours, a theater, and an exhibit hall.[48] )Tj
T*( There are several public memorials where Johnston's name is inscribed in a )Tj
T*(list of those known to have died in the eruption. These memorials include a )Tj
T*(large curved granite monument at an outside viewing area at the Johnston Ridge )Tj
T*(Observatory, which opened in 1997, and a plaque at the Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor )Tj
T*(Center, which was unveiled in a memorial grove in May 2000.[49] )Tj
T*( [edit] Depictions )Tj
T*( There have been several tellings of Johnston's story in documentaries, films )Tj
T*(and docudramas about the eruption. Documentaries such as The Eruption of Mount )Tj
T*(St. Helens! \(1980\) appeared the same year, while a movie was filmed in the year )Tj
T*(following the eruption and released to coincide with the first anniversary. The )Tj
T*(story of Mount St. Helens and Johnston continues to be told in documentaries )Tj
T*(and reconstructions several decades after the eruption took place. )Tj
T*( In the 1981 film St. Helens, actor David Huffman starred as a renamed Johnston )Tj
T*(\(David Jackson\). Controversially, Huffman's character became involved in a love )Tj
T*(affair and was killed by the blast while on top of the mountain. Johnston's )Tj
T*(parents criticized the production of the film, arguing that it possessed not )Tj
T*("an ounce of David in it" and portrayed "him as a daredevil rather than a )Tj
T*(careful scientist".[18] They threatened to sue over the fact that they felt )Tj

T*( [edit] Nomenclature )Tj
T*( In 1900, Max Planck was working on black-body radiation and suggested that the )Tj
T*(energy in electromagnetic waves could only be released in "packets" of energy. )Tj
T*(In his 1901 article [4] in Annalen der Physik he called these packets "energy )Tj
T*(elements". The word quanta \(singular quantum\) was used even before 1900 to mean )Tj
T*(particles or amounts of different quantities, including electricity. Later, in )Tj
T*(1905 Albert Einstein went further by suggesting that electromagnetic waves )Tj
T*(could only exist in these discrete wave-packets.[5] He called such a )Tj
T*(wave-packet the light quantum \(German: das Lichtquant\). The name photon derives )Tj
T*(from the Greek word for light, œÜ·ø∂œÇ \(transliterated ph√¥s\), and was coined[Note )Tj
T*(1] in 1926 by the physical chemist Gilbert Lewis, who published a speculative )Tj
T*(theory in which photons were "uncreatable and indestructible".[6] Although )Tj
T*(Lewis' theory was never accepted as it was contradicted by many experiments, )Tj
T*(his new name, photon, was adopted immediately by most physicists. Isaac Asimov )Tj
T*(credits Arthur Compton with defining quanta of energy as photons in 1923.[7][8] )Tj
T*( In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol Œ≥ \(the Greek letter )Tj
T*(gamma\). This symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays, which were )Tj
T*(discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard,[9][10] named by Ernest Rutherford in 1903, )Tj
T*(and shown to be a form of electromagnetic radiation in 1914 by Rutherford and )Tj
T*(Edward Andrade.[11] In chemistry and optical engineering, photons are usually )Tj
T*(symbolized by hŒΩ, the energy of a photon, where h is Planck's constant and the )Tj
T*(Greek letter ŒΩ \(nu\) is the photon's frequency. Much less commonly, the photon )Tj
T*(can be symbolized by hf, where its frequency is denoted by f. )Tj
T*( [edit] Physical properties )Tj
T*( The photon is massless,[Note 2] has no electric charge,[12] and is stable. A )Tj
T*(photon has two possible polarization states and is described by exactly three )Tj
T*(continuous parameters: the components of its wave vector, which determine its )Tj

T*(  The photon also carries spin angular momentum that does not depend on its )Tj
T*(frequency.[17] The magnitude of its spin is and the component measured along )Tj
T*(its direction of motion, its helicity, must be ¬±ƒß. These two possible )Tj
T*(helicities, called right-handed and left-handed, correspond to the two possible )Tj
T*(circular polarization states of the photon.[18] )Tj
T*( To illustrate the significance of these formulae, the annihilation of a )Tj
T*(particle with its antiparticle in free space must result in the creation of at )Tj
T*(least two photons for the following reason. In the center of mass frame, the )Tj
T*(colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always )Tj
T*(has momentum \(since it is determined, as we have seen, only by the photon's )Tj
T*(frequency or wavelength‚Äîwhich cannot be zero\). Hence, conservation of momentum )Tj
T*(\(or equivalently, translational invariance\) requires that at least two photons )Tj
T*(are created, with zero net momentum. \(However, it is possible if the system )Tj
T*(interacts with another particle or field for annihilation to produce one )Tj
T*(photon, as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is )Tj
T*(possible for only one photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks )Tj
T*(translational symmetry.\) The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their )Tj
T*(frequency, may be determined from conservation of four-momentum. Seen another )Tj
T*(way, the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle. The reverse process, )Tj
T*(pair production, is the dominant mechanism by which high-energy photons such as )Tj
T*(gamma rays lose energy while passing through matter.[19] That process is the )Tj
T*(reverse of "annihilation to one photon" allowed in the electric field of an )Tj
T*(atomic nucleus. )Tj
T*( The classical formulae for the energy and momentum of electromagnetic )Tj
T*(radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the )Tj
T*(pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of )Tj
T*(photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is )Tj
T*(force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.[20] )Tj
T*( [edit] Experimental checks on photon mass )Tj
T*( The photon is currently understood to be strictly massless, but this is an )Tj
T*(experimental question. If the photon is not a strictly massless particle, it )Tj
T*(would not move at the exact speed of light in vacuum, c. Its speed would be )Tj
T*(lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the )Tj
T*(so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light )Tj
T*(moves, but a constant of nature which is the maximum speed that any object )Tj
T*(could theoretically attain in space-time.[21] Thus, it would still be the speed )Tj
T*(of space-time ripples \(gravitational waves and gravitons\), but it would not be )Tj
T*(the speed of photons. )Tj
T*( A massive photon would have other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be )Tj
T*(modified and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of )Tj
T*(freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon )Tj
T*(mass than the frequency dependence of the speed of light. If Coulomb's law is )Tj
T*(not exactly valid, then that would cause the presence of an electric field )Tj
T*(inside a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. )Tj
T*(This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision.[22] A null )Tj

T*( [edit] Historical development )Tj
T*( In most theories up to the eighteenth century, light was pictured as being )Tj
T*(made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the )Tj
T*(refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were )Tj
T*(proposed by Ren√© Descartes \(1637\),[29]Robert Hooke \(1665\),[30] and Christian )Tj
T*(Huygens \(1678\);[31] however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due to )Tj
T*(the influence of Isaac Newton.[32] In the early nineteenth century, Thomas )Tj
T*(Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction )Tj
T*(of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted.[33] In 1865, James )Tj
T*(Clerk Maxwell's prediction[34] that light was an electromagnetic wave‚Äîwhich was )Tj
T*(confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio )Tj
T*(waves[35]‚Äîseemed to be the final blow to particle models of light. )Tj
T*( The Maxwell wave theory, however, does not account for all properties of )Tj
T*(light. The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only )Tj
T*(on its intensity, not on its frequency; nevertheless, several independent types )Tj
T*(of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to atoms depends only on )Tj
T*(the light's frequency, not on its intensity. For example, some chemical )Tj
T*(reactions are provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain )Tj
T*(threshold; light of frequency lower than the threshold, no matter how intense, )Tj
T*(does not initiate the reaction. Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a )Tj
T*(metal plate by shining light of sufficiently high frequency on it \(the )Tj
T*(photoelectric effect\); the energy of the ejected electron is related only to )Tj
T*(the light's frequency, not to its intensity.[36][Note 3] )Tj
T*( At the same time, investigations of blackbody radiation carried out over four )Tj
T*(decades \(1860‚Äì1900\) by various researchers[37] culminated in Max Planck's )Tj
T*(hypothesis[4][38] that the energy of any system that absorbs or emits )Tj
T*(electromagnetic radiation of frequency ŒΩ is an integer multiple of an energy )Tj
T*(quantum E=hŒΩ. As shown by Albert Einstein,[5][39] some form of energy )Tj
T*(quantization must be assumed to account for the thermal equilibrium observed )Tj
T*(between matter and electromagnetic radiation; for this explanation of the )Tj
T*(photoelectric effect, Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics.[40] )Tj
T*( Since the Maxwell theory of light allows for all possible energies of )Tj
T*(electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially that the energy )Tj
T*(quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs )Tj
T*(or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein was the first to propose that energy )Tj
T*(quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself.[5] Although he )Tj

T*( [edit] Early objections )Tj
T*( Einstein's 1905 predictions were verified experimentally in several ways in )Tj
T*(the first two decades of the 20th century, as recounted in Robert Millikan's )Tj
T*(Nobel lecture.[44] However, before Compton's experiment[42] showing that )Tj
T*(photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number \(or frequency\) )Tj
T*(\(1922\), most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic )Tj
T*(radiation itself might be particulate. \(See, for example, the Nobel lectures of )Tj
T*(Wien,[37]Planck[38] and Millikan.[44]\). Instead, there was a widespread belief )Tj
T*(that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter )Tj
T*(that absorbs or emits radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the )Tj
T*(change can be traced to experiments such as Compton scattering, where it was )Tj
T*(much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the )Tj
T*(observed results.[45] )Tj
T*( Even after Compton's experiment, Niels Bohr, Hendrik Kramers and John Slater )Tj
T*(made one last attempt to preserve the Maxwellian continuous electromagnetic )Tj
T*(field model of light, the so-called BKS model.[46] To account for the data then )Tj
T*(available, two drastic hypotheses had to be made: )Tj
T*( Energy and momentum are conserved only on the average in interactions between )Tj
T*(matter and radiation, not in elementary processes such as absorption and )Tj
T*(emission. This allows one to reconcile the discontinuously changing energy of )Tj
T*(the atom \(jump between energy states\) with the continuous release of energy )Tj
T*(into radiation.)Tj
T*(Causality is abandoned. For example, spontaneous emissions are merely emissions )Tj
T*(induced by a "virtual" electromagnetic field.)Tj
T*(  However, refined Compton experiments showed that energy-momentum is conserved )Tj
T*(extraordinarily well in elementary processes; and also that the jolting of the )Tj
T*(electron and the generation of a new photon in Compton scattering obey )Tj
T*(causality to within 10 ps. Accordingly, Bohr and his co-workers gave their )Tj
T*(model "as honorable a funeral as possible".[43] Nevertheless, the failures of )Tj
T*(the BKS model inspired Werner Heisenberg in his development of matrix )Tj
T*(mechanics.[47] )Tj
T*( A few physicists persisted[48] in developing semiclassical models in which )Tj
T*(electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears to obey the laws )Tj
T*(of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence for photons from chemical and )Tj
T*(physical experiments was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be )Tj
T*(considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of )Tj
T*(light with matter, a sufficiently complicated theory of matter could in )Tj
T*(principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories )Tj
T*(were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation )Tj
T*(experiments.[Note 4] Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a )Tj
T*(property of light itself is considered to be proven. )Tj
T*( [edit] Wave‚Äìparticle duality and uncertainty principles )Tj
T*( Photons, like all quantum objects, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like )Tj
T*(properties. Their dual wave‚Äìparticle nature can be difficult to visualize. The )Tj
T*(photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and )Tj

T*( In 1916, Einstein showed that Planck's radiation law could be derived from a )Tj

T*(relation between the rates at which atoms emit and absorb photons. The )Tj

T*( In 1910, Peter Debye derived Planck's law of black-body radiation from a )Tj

T*(1909.[39] )Tj
T*( In 1925, Born, Heisenberg and Jordan reinterpreted Debye's concept in a key )Tj

T*( [edit] The photon as a gauge boson )Tj
T*( Main article: Gauge theory )Tj
T*( The electromagnetic field can be understood as a gauge field, i.e., as a field )Tj
T*(that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every )Tj
T*(position in spacetime.[83] For the electromagnetic field, this gauge symmetry )Tj
T*(is the Abelian U\(1\) symmetry of a complex number, which reflects the ability to )Tj
T*(vary the phase of a complex number without affecting observables or real valued )Tj
T*(functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian. )Tj
T*( The quanta of an Abelian gauge field must be massless, uncharged bosons, as )Tj
T*(long as the symmetry is not broken; hence, the photon is predicted to be )Tj
T*(massless, and to have zero electric charge and integer spin. The particular )Tj
T*(form of the electromagnetic interaction specifies that the photon must have )Tj
T*(spin ¬±1; thus, its helicity must be . These two spin components correspond to )Tj
T*(the classical concepts of right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized )Tj
T*(light. However, the transient virtual photons of quantum electrodynamics may )Tj
T*(also adopt unphysical polarization states.[83] )Tj
T*( In the prevailing Standard Model of physics, the photon is one of four gauge )Tj
T*(bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W‚àí and )Tj
T*(Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the photon, these gauge )Tj
T*(bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU\(2\) gauge symmetry. )Tj
T*(The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak )Tj
T*(interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven )Tj
T*(Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in )Tj
T*(physics.[84][85][86] Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories )Tj
T*(that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons of )Tj
T*(quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as )Tj
T*(proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.[87] )Tj
T*( [edit] Contributions to the mass of a system )Tj
T*( The energy of a system that emits a photon is decreased by the energy of the )Tj
T*(photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which may result )Tj
T*(in a reduction in mass in the amount . Similarly, the mass of a system that )Tj
T*(absorbs a photon is increased by a corresponding amount. As an application, the )Tj
T*(energy balance of nuclear reactions involving photons is commonly written in )Tj
T*(terms of the masses of the nuclei involved, and terms of the form for the gamma )Tj
T*(photons \(and for other relevant energies, such as the recoil energy of )Tj
T*(nuclei\).[88] )Tj
T*( This concept is applied in key predictions of quantum electrodynamics \(QED, )Tj
T*(see above\). In that theory, the mass of electrons \(or, more generally, leptons\) )Tj
T*(is modified by including the mass contributions of virtual photons, in a )Tj
T*(technique known as renormalization. Such "radiative corrections" contribute to )Tj
T*(a number of predictions of QED, such as the magnetic dipole moment of leptons, )Tj
T*(the Lamb shift, and the hyperfine structure of bound lepton pairs, such as )Tj
T*(muonium and positronium.[89] )Tj
T*( Since photons contribute to the stress-energy tensor, they exert a )Tj
T*(gravitational attraction on other objects, according to the theory of general )Tj
T*(relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their )Tj
T*(normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in )Tj

T*(open space, a photon from the Sun takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The )Tj
T*(factor by which the speed of light is decreased in a material is called the )Tj
T*(refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing can )Tj
T*(be explained by the light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the )Tj

T*(of the matter \(quasi-particles such as phonons and excitons\) to form a )Tj
T*(polariton; this polariton has a nonzero effective mass, which means that it )Tj
T*(cannot travel at c. )Tj

T*(speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other )Tj
T*(quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin )Tj
T*(scattering.[93] )Tj
T*( Photons can also be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, provoking )Tj
T*(transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular )Tj
T*(transition of retinal C20H28O, which is responsible for vision, as discovered )Tj
T*(in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption )Tj
T*(provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such )Tj
T*(transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can )Tj
T*(even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the )Tj
T*(subject of photochemistry.[94][95] Analogously, gamma rays can in some )Tj
T*(circumstances dissociate atomic nuclei in a process called photodisintegration. )Tj
T*( [edit] Technological applications )Tj
T*( Photons have many applications in technology. These examples are chosen to )Tj
T*(illustrate applications of photons per se, rather than general optical devices )Tj
T*(such as lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light. The )Tj
T*(laser is an extremely important application and is discussed above under )Tj
T*(stimulated emission. )Tj
T*( Individual photons can be detected by several methods. The classic )Tj
T*(photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon landing on a )Tj
T*(metal plate ejects an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of )Tj
T*(electrons. Charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect in semiconductors: )Tj
T*(an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can be )Tj
T*(detected. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to )Tj
T*(ionize gas molecules, causing a detectable change in conductivity.[96] )Tj
T*( Planck's energy formula is often used by engineers and chemists in design, )Tj
T*(both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon absorption and to )Tj
T*(predict the frequency of the light emitted for a given energy transition. For )Tj

T*(using gas molecules with different electronic energy levels and adjusting the )Tj

T*( Alzheimer's disease \(AD\), also known in medical literature as Alzheimer )Tj

T*(described by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906 )Tj
T*(and was named after him.[1] Most often, AD is diagnosed in people over 65¬†years )Tj
T*(of age,[2] although the less-prevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much )Tj

T*( Although Alzheimer's disease develops differently for every individual, there )Tj
T*(are many common symptoms.[4] Early symptoms are often mistakenly thought to be )Tj
T*('age-related' concerns, or manifestations of stress.[5] In the early stages, )Tj
T*(the most common symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. When AD is )Tj
T*(suspected, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with tests that evaluate )Tj

T*( The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood. )Tj

T*(the brain.[11] Current treatments only help with the symptoms of the disease. )Tj
T*(There are no available treatments that stop or reverse the progression of the )Tj

T*(not brain pathology\) in healthy older individuals, but there is no conclusive )Tj

T*( Because AD cannot be cured and is degenerative, the sufferer relies on others )Tj
T*(for assistance. The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or )Tj

T*( The disease course is divided into four stages, with progressive patterns of )Tj
T*(cognitive and functional impairments. )Tj
T*( Pre-dementia )Tj
T*( The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress.[5] )Tj
T*(Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up )Tj
T*(to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for diagnosis of )Tj
T*(AD.[20] These early symptoms can affect the most complex daily living )Tj
T*(activities.[21] The most noticeable deficit is memory loss, which shows up as )Tj
T*(difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new )Tj
T*(information.[20][22] )Tj
T*( Subtle problems with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, )Tj
T*(flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory \(memory )Tj

T*(stages of AD.[20]Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most )Tj
T*(persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease.[23] )Tj
T*(The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed mild cognitive )Tj
T*(impairment,[22] but whether this term corresponds to a different diagnostic )Tj
T*(stage or identifies the first step of AD is a matter of dispute.[24] )Tj
T*( Early )Tj
T*( In people with AD the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually )Tj
T*(leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small portion of them, difficulties with )Tj
T*(language, executive functions, perception \(agnosia\), or execution of movements )Tj
T*(\(apraxia\) are more prominent than memory problems.[25] AD does not affect all )Tj
T*(memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life \(episodic )Tj
T*(memory\), facts learned \(semantic memory\), and implicit memory \(the memory of )Tj
T*(the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat\) are affected to a )Tj
T*(lesser degree than new facts or memories.[26][27] )Tj
T*( Language problems are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and )Tj

T*( Advanced )Tj
T*( During the final stage of AD, the person is completely dependent upon )Tj
T*(caregivers.[25] Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, )Tj
T*(eventually leading to complete loss of speech.[25][29] Despite the loss of )Tj
T*(verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional )Tj
T*(signals.[25] Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and )Tj
T*(exhaustion are much more common results.[25] People with AD will ultimately not )Tj

T*(and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden, and they lose )Tj
T*(the ability to feed themselves.[25] AD is a terminal illness, with the cause of )Tj
T*(death typically being an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers )Tj

T*( Cause )Tj
T*( The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still essentially unknown[32][33] )Tj
T*(\(except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified\). )Tj
T*(Several competing hypotheses exist trying to explain the cause of the disease: )Tj
T*( Cholinergic hypothesis )Tj
T*( The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the )Tj
T*(cholinergic hypothesis,[34] which proposes that AD is caused by reduced )Tj
T*(synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has )Tj
T*(not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to )Tj
T*(treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic )Tj
T*(effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale )Tj
T*(aggregation of amyloid,[35] leading to generalised neuroinflammation.[36] )Tj
T*( Amyloid hypothesis )Tj
T*( In 1991, the amyloid hypothesis postulated that beta-amyloid \(Œ≤A\) deposits are )Tj
T*(the fundamental cause of the disease.[37][38] Support for this postulate comes )Tj
T*(from the location of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein \(APP\) on )Tj
T*(chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 \(Down )Tj
T*(Syndrome\) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit AD by 40¬†years )Tj
T*(of age.[39][40] Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major )Tj
T*(genetic risk factor for AD. Whilst apolipoproteins enhance the break down of )Tj
T*(beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task \(such as )Tj
T*(APOE4\), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain.[41] Further evidence )Tj
T*(comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the )Tj
T*(human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain )Tj

T*( An experimental vaccine was found to clear the amyloid plaques in early human )Tj

T*( Biochemistry )Tj
T*( Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease )Tj
T*(\(proteopathy\), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta and )Tj
T*(amyloid tau proteins in the brain.[61] Plaques are made up of small peptides, )Tj
T*(39‚Äì43¬†amino acids in length, called beta-amyloid \(AŒ≤\). Beta-amyloid is a )Tj
T*(fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein \(APP\), a )Tj
T*(transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is )Tj
T*(critical to neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair.[62][63] In )Tj
T*(Alzheimer's disease, an unknown process causes APP to be divided into smaller )Tj
T*(fragments by enzymes through proteolysis.[64] One of these fragments gives rise )Tj
T*(to fibrils of beta-amyloid, which form clumps that deposit outside neurons in )Tj
T*(dense formations known as senile plaques.[11][65] )Tj
T*( AD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau )Tj
T*(protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly )Tj
T*(made up of structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, )Tj
T*(guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the )Tj
T*(axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when )Tj
T*(phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In )Tj
T*(AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then )Tj
T*(begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and )Tj
T*(disintegrating the neuron's transport system.[66] )Tj
T*( Disease mechanism )Tj
T*( Exactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the beta-amyloid )Tj
T*(peptide gives rise to the pathology of AD is not known.[67] The amyloid )Tj
T*(hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as )Tj
T*(the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated )Tj
T*(amyloid fibrils, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein )Tj
T*(responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces )Tj
T*(programmed cell death \(apoptosis\).[68] It is also known that Œ≤A selectively )Tj
T*(builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and )Tj
T*(it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by )Tj
T*(neurons.[69] )Tj
T*( Various inflammatory processes and cytokines may also have a role in the )Tj
T*(pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue )Tj
T*(damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a )Tj
T*(marker of an immunological response.[70] )Tj
T*( Alterations in the distribution of different neurotrophic factors and in the )Tj
T*(expression of their receptors such as the brain derived neurotrophic factor )Tj
T*(\(BDNF\) have been described in AD.[71][72] )Tj
T*( Genetics )Tj
T*( The vast majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, meaning that )Tj
T*(they are not genetically inherited although some genes may act as risk factors. )Tj
T*(On the other hand, around 0.1% of the cases are familial forms of autosomal )Tj
T*(dominant \(not sex-linked\) inheritance, which usually have an onset before age )Tj
T*(65.[73] This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's )Tj
T*(disease. )Tj
T*( Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one )Tj
T*(of three genes: amyloid precursor protein \(APP\) and presenilins 1 and 2.[74] )Tj
T*(Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a )Tj
T*(small protein called Œ≤A42, which is the main component of senile plaques.[75] )Tj
T*(Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Œ≤A42 and the other major )Tj
T*(forms‚Äîe.g., Œ≤A40‚Äîwithout increasing Œ≤A42 levels.[75][76] This suggests that )Tj
T*(presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of )Tj
T*(Œ≤A produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for )Tj
T*(alterations in the function of APP and/or its fragments other than Œ≤A. )Tj

T*(thousand person‚Äìyears for all dementias and 5‚Äì8 for AD,[208][209] which means )Tj

T*( History )Tj
T*( The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and physicians associated old age )Tj
T*(with increasing dementia.[1] It was not until 1901 that German psychiatrist )Tj
T*(Alois Alzheimer identified the first case of what became known as Alzheimer's )Tj
T*(disease in a fifty-year-old woman he called Auguste D. He followed her case )Tj
T*(until she died in 1906, when he first reported publicly on it.[214] During the )Tj
T*(next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature, )Tj
T*(some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease.[1] The disease was )Tj
T*(first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing )Tj
T*(some of the clinical \(delusions and hallucinations\) and pathological features )Tj
T*(\(arteriosclerotic changes\) contained in the original report of Auguste D.[215] )Tj
T*(He included Alzheimer's disease, also named presenile dementia by Kraepelin, as )Tj
T*(a subtype of senile dementia in the eighth edition of his Textbook of )Tj
T*(Psychiatry, published on July 15, 1910.[216] )Tj
T*( For most of the 20th century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was )Tj
T*(reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms )Tj
T*(of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD )Tj
T*(concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and )Tj
T*(senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that )Tj
T*(this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes.[217] This )Tj
T*(eventually led to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease independently of )Tj
T*(age.[218] The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type \(SDAT\) was used for a )Tj
T*(time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's )Tj
T*(disease being used for those younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease )Tj
T*(was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all )Tj
T*(ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and )Tj
T*(neuropathology.[219] )Tj
T*( Society and culture )Tj
T*( Social costs )Tj
T*( Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly )Tj
T*(diseases for society in Europe and the United States,[18][19] while their cost )Tj
T*(in other countries such as Argentina,[220] or South Korea,[221] is also high )Tj
T*(and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, )Tj
T*(becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct )Tj
T*(medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as )Tj
T*(in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient )Tj
T*(and caregiver.[19] Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide )Tj
T*(have been calculated around $160¬†billion,[222] while costs of Alzheimer's )Tj
T*(disease in the United States may be $100¬†billion each year.[19] )Tj
T*( The greatest origin of costs for society is the long-term care by health care )Tj
T*(professionals and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 )Tj
T*(of the total costs for society.[18]The cost of living at home is also very )Tj
T*(high,[18] especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving )Tj
T*(time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account.[223] )Tj
T*( Costs increase with dementia severity and the presence of behavioural )Tj
T*(disturbances,[224] and are related to the increased caregiving time required )Tj
T*(for the provision of physical care.[223] Therefore any treatment that slows )Tj
T*(cognitive decline, delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers' hours )Tj
T*(will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have )Tj
T*(shown positive results.[19] )Tj
T*( Caregiving burden )Tj
T*( The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close )Tj
T*(relative.[14] Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on )Tj
T*(caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic )Tj
T*(aspects.[15][16][17] Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their )Tj
T*(families.[225] This option also delays or eliminates the need for more )Tj
T*(professional and costly levels of care.[225][226] Nevertheless two-thirds of )Tj

T*(for Manila, and then sailing north to Japan in 1620.[3] He is conventionally )Tj
T*(considered the first Japanese ambassador in the Americas and in Europe.[4] )Tj
T*( Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially received in Europe, it happened at a )Tj
T*(time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity. European )Tj
T*(monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura )Tj
T*(had been seeking. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year )Tj
T*(later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly )Tj
T*(isolationist Japan. )Tj
T*( Japan's next embassy to Europe would only occur more than 200 years later, )Tj
T*(following two centuries of isolation, with the "First Japanese Embassy to )Tj

T*( [edit] Early life )Tj
T*( Little is known of the early life of Hasekura Tsunenaga. He was a mid-level )Tj
T*(noble samurai in the Sendai Domain in northern Japan, who had the opportunity )Tj
T*(to directly serve the daimyo Date Masamune. They were of roughly the same age, )Tj
T*(and it is recorded that several important missions were given to Tsunenaga as )Tj
T*(his representative. )Tj
T*( It is also recorded that Hasekura served as samurai of the Japanese invasion )Tj
T*(of Korea under the Taiko Toyotomi Hideyoshi, during six months in 1597. )Tj
T*( In 1612, Hasekura's father, Hasekura Tsunenari \(ÊîØÂÄâ Â∏∏Êàê\), was indicted for )Tj
T*(corruption, and he was put to death in 1613. His fief was confiscated, and his )Tj
T*(son should normally have been executed as well. Date however gave him the )Tj
T*(opportunity to redeem his honour by placing him in charge of the Embassy to )Tj
T*(Europe, and soon gave him back his territories as well. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background: early contacts between Japan and Spain )Tj
T*( The Spanish started trans-Pacific voyages between New Spain \(Mexico\) and the )Tj
T*(Philippines in 1565. The famous Manila galleons carried silver from Mexican )Tj
T*(mines westward to the entrep√¥t of Manila in the Spanish possession of the )Tj
T*(Philippines. There, the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods )Tj
T*(gathered from throughout Asia, including \(until 1638\) goods from Japan. The )Tj
T*(return route of the Manila galleons, first charted by the Spanish navigator )Tj
T*(Andr√©s de Urdaneta, took the ships northeast into the Kuroshio Current \(also )Tj
T*(known as the Japan Current\) off the coast of Japan, and then across the Pacific )Tj
T*(to the west coast of North America, landing eventually in Acapulco.[5] )Tj
T*( Spanish ships were periodically shipwrecked on the coasts of Japan due to bad )Tj
T*(weather, initiating contacts with the country. The Spanish wished to expand the )Tj
T*(Christian faith in Japan. Efforts to expand influence in Japan were met by )Tj
T*(stiff resistance towards the Jesuits, who had started the evangelizing of the )Tj
T*(country in 1549, as well as by the opposition of Portuguese and the Dutch who )Tj
T*(did not wish to see Spain participate in Japanese trade. However, some )Tj
T*(Japanese, such as Christopher and Cosmas, are known to have crossed the Pacific )Tj
T*(onboard Spanish galleons as early as 1587. It is known that gifts were )Tj
T*(exchanged between the governor of the Philippines and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who )Tj
T*(thanks him in a 1597 letter, writing "The black elephant in particular I found )Tj
T*(most unusual."[6] )Tj
T*( In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco encountered bad weather on )Tj
T*(its way from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in )Tj
T*(Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's )Tj
T*(captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met )Tj
T*(with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, )Tj
T*(signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in )Tj
T*(eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish )Tj
T*(ships would be allowed to visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese )Tj

T*(Japanese ship in order to guarantee the safety of their reception in New Spain, )Tj
T*(but insisted that another Franciscan, named Alonso Mu√±os, be sent instead as )Tj
T*(the Shogun's representative. In 1610, the returning Rodrigo de Vivero, several )Tj
T*(Spanish sailors, the Franciscan father, and 22 Japanese representatives led by )Tj
T*(the trader Tanaka Sh≈çsuke, sailed to Mexico aboard the San Buena Ventura, a )Tj
T*(ship built by the English adventurer William Adams for the Shogun. Once in New )Tj
T*(Spain, Alonso Mu√±os met with the Viceroy Luis de Velasco, who agreed to send an )Tj
T*(ambassador to Japan in the person of the famous explorer Sebastian Vizcaino, )Tj
T*(with the added mission of exploring the "Gold and silver islands" \("Isla de )Tj
T*(Plata"\) that were thought to be east of the Japanese isles. )Tj
T*( Vizcaino arrived in Japan in 1611, and had many meetings with the Shogun and )Tj
T*(feudal lords. These encounters were tainted by his poor respect for Japanese )Tj
T*(customs, the mounting resistance of the Japanese towards Catholic proselytism, )Tj
T*(and the intrigues of the Dutch against Spanish ambitions. Vizcaino finally left )Tj
T*(to search for the "Silver island", during which search he encountered bad )Tj
T*(weather, forcing him to return to Japan with heavy damage. )Tj

T*( Without waiting for Vizcaino, another ship ‚Äì built in Izu by the Bakufu under )Tj

T*( The Shogun decided to build a new galleon in Japan in order to bring Vizcaino )Tj
T*(back to Nueva Espa√±a, together with a Japanese embassy accompanied by Luis )Tj

T*(  The objective of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements )Tj

T*( In April 1618, the San Juan Bautista arrived in the Philippines from Mexico, )Tj

T*( The direct effect of Hasekura's return to Sendai was the interdiction of )Tj
T*(Christianity in the Sendai fief two days later: )Tj
T*( "Two days after the return of Rokuemon to Sendai, a three-point edict against )Tj

T*(who did not, they would be exiled if they were nobles, and killed if they were )Tj
T*(citizens, peasants or servants. Second, that a reward would be given for the )Tj

T*(1620 letter of father Angelis, Japan-China archives of the Jesuits in Rome, )Tj
T*(quoted in Gonoi's "Hasekura Tsunenaga", p231\))Tj
T*(  What Hasekura said or did to bring about such a result is unknown. As later )Tj

T*(Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic ‚Äì and to a certain extent, )Tj
T*(disturbing ‚Äì account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the )Tj
T*(Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church )Tj
T*(and Date Masamune to take over the country \(an idea advertized by the )Tj
T*(Franciscans while in Rome\), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally )Tj
T*(unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when )Tj
T*(Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as )Tj
T*(long as persecutions were occurring in the rest of the country. )Tj
T*( Date Masamune, heretofore very tolerant of Christianity in spite of the )Tj
T*(Bakufu's prohibition in the land it directly controlled, thus suddenly chose to )Tj
T*(distance himself from the Western faith. The first executions of Christians )Tj
T*(started 40 days later. The anti-Christian measures taken by Date Masumune were )Tj
T*(however comparatively mild, and Japanese and Western Christians repeatedly )Tj
T*(claimed that he only took them to appease the Shogun: )Tj
T*( "Date Masumune, out of fear of the Shogun, ordered the persecution of )Tj
T*(Christianity in his territory, and created several martyrs." \(Letter of 17 )Tj
T*(prominent Japanese Christians from Sendai, to the Pope, 29 September 1621\).[25])Tj
T*(  One month after Hasekura's return, Date Masamune wrote a letter to the Shogun )Tj
T*(Tokugawa Hidetada, in which he makes a very clear effort to evade )Tj
T*(responsibility for the embassy, explaining in detail how it was organized with )Tj
T*(the approval, and even the collaboration, of the Shogun: )Tj
T*( "When I sent a ship to the Southern Barbarian countries several years ago, )Tj

T*(  Spain was by far the most threatening power for Japan at that time \(with a )Tj

T*(such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish )Tj
T*(embassy also contributed to the decision. )Tj
T*( What became of Hasekura is unknown and accounts of his last years are )Tj
T*(numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could only rely on hearsay, with )Tj
T*(some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, others that he was )Tj

T*(The fate of his descendants and servants, who were later executed for being )Tj
T*(Christians, would suggest that Hasekura remained strongly Christian himself, )Tj
T*(and transmitted his faith to the members of his family. )Tj
T*( Sotelo, who returned to Japan but was caught and finally burnt at the stake in )Tj
T*(1624, gave before his execution an account of Hasekura returning to Japan as a )Tj
T*(hero who propagated the Christian faith: )Tj
T*( "My other colleague, the ambassador Philippus Faxecura, after he reached his )Tj
T*(aforementioned king \(Date Masamune\), was greatly honored by him, and sent to )Tj
T*(his own estate, to rest after such a long and tiring journey, where he made his )Tj
T*(wife, children, servants, and many other vassals into Christians, and advised )Tj
T*(other nobles who were his kith and kin to accept the faith, which they indeed )Tj
T*(did. While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his )Tj
T*(return, having provided much instruction and a great example, with much )Tj
T*(preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special )Tj
T*(inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, and the protection of )Tj
T*(the religious \(i.e. "members of religious orders"\) in that kingdom. The King )Tj
T*(and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the )Tj
T*(Christians and Religious, who knew very well the virtue and religious zeal of )Tj
T*(this man. This is what I heard by letters from the very Religious who )Tj
T*(administered the sacraments to him, and who had been present at his death, as )Tj
T*(well as from others." \(Luis Sotelo, De ecclesiae Iaponicae statu relatio\).[26])Tj
T*(  Hasekura also did bring back to Japan several Catholic artifacts, but he did )Tj
T*(not give them to his ruler, and instead kept them in his own estate. )Tj
T*( Hasekura Tsunenaga died of illness \(according to Japanese as well as Christian )Tj
T*(sources\) in 1622, but the location of his grave is not known for certain. Three )Tj
T*(graves are claimed as Hasekura's. The most likely is in the outskirts of Osato )Tj
T*(town \(Â§ßÈÉ∑Áî∫\) in Miyagi. Another is visible in the Buddhist temple of Enfukuji )Tj
T*(\(ÂÜÜÈï∑Â±±ÂÜÜÁ¶èÂØ∫\) in Miyagi. Another is clearly marked \(along with a memorial to )Tj

T*(at Komyoji Temple \(ÂÖâÊòéÂØ∫\). )Tj
T*( [edit] Execution of his descendants and servants )Tj
T*( Hasekura had a son, named Rokuemon Tsuneyori. Two of his son's servants, )Tj
T*(Yogoemon \(‰∏é‰∫îÂè≥Ë°õÈñÄ\) and his wife, were convicted of being Christian but )Tj
T*(refused to recant their faith under torture \(reverse hanging, called )Tj
T*("Tsurushi", Èá£ÊÆ∫„Åó\) and as a result died in August 1637 \(as the lives of )Tj
T*(Christians were spared if they recanted, these executions indicate that they )Tj
T*(were steadfast and refused to deny their faith\). In 1637, Rokuemon Tsuneyori )Tj
T*(himself also came under suspicion of Christianity after being denounced by )Tj
T*(someone from Edo, but escaped questioning because he was the master of the Zen )Tj
T*(temple of Komyoji \(ÂÖâÊòéÂØ∫\). In 1640, two other servants of Tsuneyori, )Tj
T*(Tarozaemon \(Â§™ÈÉéÂ∑¶Ë°õÈñÄ, 71\), who had followed Hasekura to Rome, and his wife )Tj
T*(\(59\), were convicted of being Christians, and, also refusing to recant their )Tj

T*(decapitated the same day, at the age of 42, for having failed to denounce )Tj
T*(Christians under his roof, although it remained unconfirmed whether he was )Tj

T*(in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. )Tj
T*(The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made )Tj
T*(again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen )Tj

T*( The very existence of the travels of Hasekura was forgotten in Japan until the )Tj

T*(for the first time of the travels of Hasekura when shown documents during their )Tj
T*(visit to Venice in Italy.[28] )Tj

T*( Babakotia is an extinct genus of medium-sized lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, )Tj
T*(from Madagascar that contains a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together )Tj
T*(with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family )Tj
T*(Palaeopropithecidae, commonly known as the sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia )Tj
T*(comes from the Malagasy name for the Indri, babakoto, to which it and all other )Tj
T*(sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits that )Tj
T*(show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the )Tj
T*(suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between )Tj
T*(both groups and the closely related and extinct monkey lemurs. )Tj
T*( Babakotia radofilai and all other sloth lemurs share many traits with living )Tj
T*(sloths, demonstrating convergent evolution. It had long forearms, curved )Tj
T*(digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily )Tj
T*(built than that of indriids, but not as much as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its )Tj
T*(dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived )Tj
T*(in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other )Tj
T*(sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus )Tj
T*(dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater \(folivore\), )Tj
T*(though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil )Tj
T*(remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the )Tj
T*(island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to )Tj
T*(know for certain. )Tj
T*( [edit] Etymology )Tj
T*( The name of the genus Babakotia derives from the Malagasy common name for the )Tj
T*(Indri, babakoto, a close relative of Babakotia. The species name, radofilai, )Tj
T*(was chosen in honor of French mathematician and expatriate Jean Radofilao, an )Tj
T*(avid spelunker who mapped the caves where remains of Babakotia radofilai were )Tj
T*(first found.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Classification and phylogeny )Tj
T*( Babakotia radofilai is the sole member of the genus Babakotia and belongs to )Tj
T*(the family Palaeopropithecidae, which includes three other genera of sloth )Tj
T*(lemurs: Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus. This family in )Tj
T*(turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy )Tj
T*(lemurs.[1][3] )Tj
T*( The first subfossil remains of Babakotia radofilai were discovered as part of )Tj
T*(a series of expeditions launched in the early 1980s by biological )Tj
T*(anthropologist Elwyn Simons.[6] They were unearthed in 1988 at a cave known as )Tj
T*(Antsiroandoha in the Ankarana Massif, northern Madagascar. A nearly complete )Tj
T*(skeleton and skull were found, in addition to the remains of roughly a dozen )Tj
T*(other individuals.[4] Identified immediately as a sloth lemur )Tj
T*(\(palaeopropithecid\) upon its discovery,[5]Babakotia along with Mesopropithecus )Tj
T*(helped to settle a debate about the relationship between the sloth lemurs, the )Tj
T*(monkey lemurs \(family Archaeolemuridae\) and the living indriids. The monkey )Tj
T*(lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth )Tj
T*(were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The larger sloth )Tj
T*(lemurs, on the other hand, retained a dentition similar to living indriids, yet )Tj
T*(differed by having more robust and specialized skulls. Babakotia and )Tj
T*(Mesopropithecus not only shared the indriid dentition, but also the )Tj
T*(indriid-like skulls, providing evidence that sloth lemurs were most closely )Tj
T*(related to living indriids, with monkey lemurs as a sister group to both.[7] )Tj

T*(Furthermore, the discovery of Babakotia helped to demonstrate that the )Tj

T*( Weighing between 16 and 20 kg \(35 and 44 lb\), Babakotia radofilai was a )Tj
T*(medium-sized lemur and noticeably smaller than the large sloth lemurs )Tj
T*(\(Archaeoindris and Palaeopropithecus\), but larger than the small sloth lemurs )Tj
T*(\(Mesopropithecus\).[1][3] In many ways, it had an intermediate level of )Tj
T*(adaptations for suspensory behavior between the large sloth lemurs and the )Tj
T*(small sloth lemurs.[3][4][9][7][10] This includes its highly mobile hip and )Tj
T*(ankle joints, as well as other specializations in the vertebral column, pelvis, )Tj
T*(and limbs.[10] Its forelimbs were 20% longer than its hind limbs, giving it a )Tj
T*(higher intermembral index \(~119\) than Mesopropithecus \(~97 to 113\), suggesting )Tj
T*(that it was convergently similar to arboreal sloths.[10][11] It had a reduced )Tj
T*(tarsus and curved, elongated digits, adapted for grasping and suggesting )Tj
T*(suspensory behavior.[10][12] Its hind feet were reduced, making it well-adapted )Tj
T*(for climbing and hanging \(like in other palaeopropithecids\), but not leaping )Tj
T*(\(like in indriids\).[1][3][4] Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrated )Tj
T*(that this species was a vertical climber.[13] Additionally, analysis of its )Tj
T*(semicircular canals,[14]lumbar vertebrae and its spinous processes indicate )Tj
T*(slow movement and climbing \(antipronograde\) adaptations, but not necessarily )Tj
T*(sloth-like hanging, vertical clinging, or leaping.[15] Therefore, it was likely )Tj
T*(a slow climber like a loris and also exhibited some suspensory behavior like a )Tj
T*(sloth.[6] )Tj
T*( All sloth lemurs have relatively robust skulls compared to the indriids,[3] )Tj
T*(yet despite shared cranial features with the larger sloth lemurs,[7] its skull )Tj
T*(still resembles that of an Indri.[1] The cranial traits shared with the other )Tj
T*(sloth lemurs include relatively small orbits, robust zygomatic arches, and a )Tj
T*(mostly rectangular hard palate.[3] The small orbits taken into consideration )Tj
T*(with the relative size of the optic canal suggests that Babakotia had low )Tj
T*(visual acuity, which is typical for lemurs.[18] The skull length averages 144¬†)Tj
T*(mm \(5.7¬†in\).[4] )Tj
T*( The dental formula of Babakotia radofilai was the same as the other sloth )Tj
T*(lemurs and indriids: either [3][7] or .[4] It is unclear whether one of the )Tj
T*(teeth in the permanent dentition is an incisor or canine, resulting in these )Tj
T*(two conflicting dental formulae.[19] Regardless, the lack of either a lower )Tj
T*(canine or incisor results in a four-tooth toothcomb instead of the more typical )Tj
T*(six-tooth strepsirrhine toothcomb. Babakotia radofilai differed slightly from )Tj
T*(indriids in having somewhat elongated premolars. Its cheek teeth had broad )Tj
T*(shearing crests and crenulated enamel.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and ecology )Tj
T*( Like all other lemurs, Babakotia radofilai was endemic to Madagascar. Its )Tj
T*(remains have only been found in limestone caves at the Ankarana Massif and )Tj
T*(Anjohibe, indicating a range across the extreme north and northwest of the )Tj
T*(island.[3][4][20] The restricted range of this arboreal primate, particularly )Tj
T*(during a time when much of the island was blanketed in forest, might have been )Tj
T*(due to habitat specificity, competitive exclusion, or some other unknown )Tj
T*(factor.[21] It was sympatric \(occurred together\) with Palaeopropithecus maximus )Tj
T*(and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion.[6] )Tj
T*( Based on its size, the morphology of its molars, and microwear analysis on its )Tj
T*(teeth, Babakotia radofilai was likely a folivore, while supplementing its diet )Tj
T*(with fruit and hard seeds.[1][9][18][22] In all sloth lemurs, including )Tj
T*(Babakotia radofilai, the permanent teeth erupted early, a trait seen in )Tj
T*(indriids that improves survivability of juveniles during the first dry season )Tj
T*(following weaning.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Extinction )Tj
T*( Because it died out relatively recently and is only known from subfossil )Tj
T*(remains, it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur.[20]Babakotia )Tj
T*(radofilai lived during the Holocene epoch and is thought to have disappeared )Tj

T*( The Cock Lane ghost was a purported haunting that attracted mass public )Tj
T*(attention in 1762. The location was an apartment in Cock Lane, a short road )Tj
T*(adjacent to London's Smithfield market and a few minutes' walk from St Paul's )Tj
T*(Cathedral. The event centred around three people: William Kent, a usurer from )Tj
T*(Norfolk, Richard Parsons, a parish clerk, and Parsons' daughter Elizabeth. )Tj
T*( Following the death during childbirth of Kent's wife, Elizabeth Lynes, he )Tj
T*(became romantically involved with her sister, Fanny. Canon law prevented the )Tj
T*(couple from marrying, but they nevertheless moved to London and lodged at the )Tj
T*(property in Cock Lane, then owned by Parsons. Several accounts of strange )Tj
T*(knocking sounds and ghostly apparitions were reported, although for the most )Tj
T*(part they stopped after the couple moved out, but following Fanny's death from )Tj
T*(smallpox, and Kent's successful legal action against Parsons over an )Tj
T*(outstanding debt, they began again. Parsons claimed that Fanny's ghost haunted )Tj
T*(his property, and later his daughter. Regular s√©ances were held to determine )Tj
T*("Scratching Fanny's" motives, and Cock Lane was often made impassable by the )Tj
T*(throngs of interested bystanders. )Tj
T*( The ghost appeared to claim that Fanny had been poisoned with arsenic, and )Tj
T*(Kent was publicly suspected of being her murderer, but a commission whose )Tj
T*(members included Samuel Johnson concluded that the supposed haunting was a )Tj
T*(fraud. Further investigations proved the scam was perpetrated by Elizabeth )Tj
T*(Parsons, under duress from her father. Those responsible were prosecuted and )Tj
T*(found guilty; Richard Parsons was pilloried and sentenced to two years in )Tj
T*(prison. )Tj
T*( The Cock Lane ghost became a focus of controversy between the Methodist and )Tj
T*(Anglican churches and is referenced frequently in contemporary literature. )Tj
T*(Charles Dickens is one of several Victorian authors whose work alluded to the )Tj
T*(story and the pictorial satirist William Hogarth referenced the ghost in two of )Tj

T*(Lynes, the daughter of a grocer from Lyneham. They moved to Stoke Ferry where )Tj
T*(Kent kept an inn, and later the local post office. They were apparently very )Tj
T*(much in love, but their marriage was short-lived as within a month of the move )Tj
T*(Elizabeth died during childbirth. Her sister Frances‚Äîcommonly known as )Tj
T*(Fanny‚Äîhad during Elizabeth's pregnancy moved in with the couple, and she )Tj
T*(remained to take care of the infant and its father. The boy did not survive )Tj
T*(long and rather than leave, Fanny stayed on to take care of William and the )Tj
T*(house. The two soon began a relationship, but canon law appeared to rule out )Tj
T*(marriage; when Kent travelled to London to seek advice he was told that as )Tj
T*(Elizabeth had borne him a living son, a union with Fanny was impossible. In )Tj
T*(January 1759 therefore, he gave up the post office, left Fanny and moved to )Tj
T*(London, intending to "purchase a place in some public office" in the hope that )Tj
T*("business would erase that passion he had unfortunately indulged". Fanny )Tj
T*(meanwhile stayed with one of her brothers at Lyneham.[2] )Tj
T*( Despite her family's disapproval of their relationship, Fanny began to write )Tj
T*(passionate letters to Kent, "filled with repeated entreaties to spend the rest )Tj
T*(of their lives together". He eventually allowed her to join him at lodgings in )Tj
T*(East Greenwich near London. The two decided to live together as man and wife, )Tj
T*(making wills in each other's favour and hoping to remain discreet. In this, )Tj
T*(however, they did not reckon on Fanny's relations. The couple moved to lodgings )Tj
T*(near the Mansion House, but their landlord there may have learnt of their )Tj
T*(relationship from Fanny's family, expressing his contempt by refusing to repay )Tj
T*(a sum of money Kent loaned him \(about ¬£20\).[nb 1] In response, Kent had him )Tj
T*(arrested.[4] )Tj
T*( While attending early morning prayers at the church of St )Tj
T*(Sepulchre-without-Newgate William Kent and Fanny met Richard Parsons, the )Tj
T*(officiating clerk[4] Although he was generally considered respectable, Parsons )Tj
T*(was known locally as a drunk and was struggling to provide for his family. He )Tj
T*(listened to the couple's plight and was sympathetic, offering them the use of )Tj
T*(lodgings in his home at what \(in 1965\) was 20¬†Cock Lane, to the north of St )Tj
T*(Sepulchre's. Located along a narrow, winding thoroughfare similar to most of )Tj
T*(central London's streets, the three-storey house was in a respectable but )Tj
T*(declining area, and comprised a single room on each floor, connected by a )Tj
T*(winding staircase.[5] Shortly after Mr and Mrs Kent \(as they called themselves\) )Tj
T*(moved in, Kent loaned Parsons 12¬†guineas, to be repaid at a rate of a guinea )Tj
T*(per month.[6] )Tj
T*( It was while Kent was away at a wedding in the country that the first reports )Tj
T*(of strange noises began. Parsons had a wife and two daughters; the elder, )Tj
T*(Elizabeth, was described as a "little artful girl about eleven years of )Tj
T*(age".[7] Kent asked Elizabeth to stay with Fanny, who was then several months )Tj
T*(into a pregnancy, and to share her bed while he was away. The two reported )Tj
T*(hearing scratching and rapping noises. These were attributed by Mrs Parsons to )Tj
T*(a neighbouring cobbler, although when the noises re-occurred on a Sunday, Fanny )Tj
T*(asked if the cobbler was working that day; Mrs Parsons told her he was not. )Tj
T*(James Franzen, landlord of the nearby Wheat Sheaf public house, was another )Tj
T*(witness. After visiting the house he reported seeing a ghostly white figure )Tj
T*(ascend the stairs, and terrified, left to go home. Parsons visited him there )Tj
T*(that same night, and claimed also to have seen a ghost.[8][9] )Tj
T*( As Fanny was only weeks away from giving birth Kent made arrangements to move )Tj
T*(to a property at Bartlet's Court in Clerkenwell, but by January 1760 it was not )Tj
T*(ready and so they moved instead to an "inconvenient" apartment nearby, )Tj
T*(intending only a temporary stay.[10][11] However, on 25¬†January Fanny fell ill. )Tj
T*(The attending doctor diagnosed the early stages of an eruptive fever and agreed )Tj
T*(with Kent that their lodgings were inadequate for someone at so critical a )Tj
T*(stage of pregnancy. Fanny was therefore moved, by coach, to Bartlet's Court. )Tj
T*(The next day her doctor returned and met with her apothecary. Both agreed that )Tj
T*(Fanny's symptoms were indicative of smallpox. On hearing this, Fanny sent for )Tj
T*(an attorney, to ensure the will she had had made was in good order, and that )Tj
T*(Kent would inherit her estate. An acquaintance of Kent's, the Reverend Stephen )Tj
T*(Aldrich of St John Clerkenwell, reassured her that she would be forgiven for )Tj

T*(her sins. She died on 2¬†February.[12] )Tj
T*( As sole executor of Fanny's will, Kent ordered a coffin, but fearful of being )Tj
T*(prosecuted should the nature of their relationship become known, asked that it )Tj
T*(remain nameless. On registering the burial he was, however, forced to give a )Tj
T*(name, and he gave her his own. Fanny's family was notified and her sister Ann )Tj
T*(Lynes, who lived nearby at Pall Mall, attended the funeral at St John's. When )Tj
T*(Ann learned of the terms of Fanny's will, which left her brothers and sisters )Tj
T*(half a crown each and Kent the rest, she tried but failed to block it in )Tj
T*(Doctors' Commons. The bulk of Kent's inheritance was Fanny's ¬£150 share of her )Tj
T*(dead brother Thomas's estate. This also included some land owned by Thomas, )Tj
T*(sold by the executor of his estate, John Lynes, and Kent received Fanny's share )Tj
T*(of that too \(almost ¬£95\). Her family resented this. Legal problems with Lynes's )Tj
T*(sale meant that each of Thomas's beneficiaries had to pay ¬£45 in compensation )Tj
T*(to the purchaser, but Kent refused, claiming that he had already spent the )Tj
T*(money in settling Fanny's debts. In response to this, in October 1761 John )Tj
T*(Lynes began proceedings against Kent in the Court of Chancery.[nb 2] Meanwhile )Tj
T*(Kent became a stockbroker, and in 1761 married again.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Haunting )Tj
T*( Echoing the actions of Kent's previous landlord, Parsons had not repaid Kent's )Tj
T*(loan‚Äîof which about three guineas was outstanding‚Äîand Kent therefore instructed )Tj
T*(his attorney to sue him.[10][11] He managed to recover the debt by January )Tj
T*(1762, just as the mysterious noises at Cock Lane began again.[7] Catherine )Tj
T*(Friend had lodged there shortly after the couple left but moved out when she )Tj
T*(found the noises, which had returned intermittently and which were becoming )Tj
T*(more frequent, could not be stopped. They apparently emanated from Elizabeth )Tj
T*(Parsons, who also suffered fits, and the house was regularly disturbed by )Tj
T*(unexplained noises, likened at the time to the sound of a cat scratching a )Tj
T*(chair.[7] Reportedly determined to discover their source, Richard Parsons had a )Tj
T*(carpenter remove the wainscotting around Elizabeth's bed.[14] He approached )Tj
T*(John Moore, assistant preacher at St Sepulchre's since 1754 and rector of St )Tj
T*(Bartholomew-the-Great in West Smithfield since June 1761. The presence of one )Tj
T*(ghost, presumed to belong to Fanny's sister, Elizabeth, had already been noted )Tj
T*(while Fanny lay dying, and the two concluded that the spirit now haunting )Tj
T*(Parsons' house must be that of Fanny Lynes herself. The notion that a person's )Tj
T*(spirit might return from the dead to warn those still alive was a commonly held )Tj
T*(belief, and the presence of two apparently restless spirits was therefore an )Tj
T*(obvious sign to both men that each ghost had an important message to )Tj
T*(disclose.[15] )Tj
T*( Parsons and Moore devised a method of communication; one knock for yes, two )Tj
T*(knocks for no. Using this system, the ghost appeared to claim that Fanny had )Tj
T*(been murdered. It was conjectured that the mysterious figure in white which so )Tj
T*(terrified James Franzen, presumed to be the ghost of Elizabeth, had appeared )Tj
T*(there to warn her sister of her impending death. As the first ghost had )Tj
T*(seemingly vanished, this charge against Kent‚Äîthat he murdered Elizabeth‚Äîwas )Tj
T*(never acted on, but through repeated questioning of Fanny's ghost it was )Tj
T*(divined that she had died not from the effects of smallpox, but rather from )Tj
T*(arsenic poisoning. The deadly toxin had apparently been administered by Kent )Tj
T*(about two hours before Fanny died and now, it was supposed, her spirit wanted )Tj
T*(justice. Moore had heard from Parsons how Kent had pursued the debt he was )Tj
T*(owed, and he had also heard from Ann Lynes, who had complained that as Fanny's )Tj
T*(coffin lid was screwed down she had not been able to see her sister's corpse. )Tj
T*(Moore thought that Fanny's body might not show any visible signs of smallpox )Tj
T*(and that if she had been poisoned, the lack of scarring would have been )Tj
T*(something Kent would rather keep hidden. As a clergyman with inclinations )Tj

T*( After reading the veiled accusations made against him in the Public Ledger, )Tj
T*(Kent determined to clear his name, and accompanied by a witness went to see )Tj
T*(John Moore. The Methodist showed Kent the list of questions he and Parsons had )Tj
T*(drawn up for the ghost to answer. One concerned William and Fanny's marital )Tj
T*(status, prompting Kent to admit that they never married. Moore told him he did )Tj
T*(not think he was a murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence )Tj
T*(indicated that "there was something behind darker than all the rest, and that )Tj
T*(if he would go to Parson's house, he might be a witness to the same and )Tj
T*(convinced of its reality". On 12¬†January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of )Tj
T*(the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Reverend )Tj
T*(Broughton, went to Cock Lane. On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was )Tj
T*(publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. The audience )Tj
T*(sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. They were warned that )Tj
T*(the ghost was sensitive to disbelief, and told that they should accord it due )Tj
T*(respect. When the s√©ance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer,[7] ran )Tj
T*(around the room shouting "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? Do come, pray )Tj
T*(Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" Nothing happened, and Moore told the group the )Tj
T*(ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. He asked them to leave )Tj
T*(the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. )Tj
T*(About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned, and that they )Tj
T*(should re-enter the room.[18] Moore then started to run through his and )Tj
T*(Parsons' list of questions: )Tj
T*( "Are you the wife of Mr. Kent?"¬†‚ÄîTwo knocks)Tj
T*("Did you die naturally?"¬†‚ÄîTwo knocks)Tj
T*("By poison?"¬†‚ÄîOne knock)Tj
T*("Did any person other than Mr. Kent administer it?"¬†‚ÄîTwo knocks)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( After more questions, a member of the audience exclaimed "Kent, ask this Ghost )Tj
T*(if you shall be hanged". He did so, and the question was answered by a single )Tj
T*(knock. Kent exclaimed "Thou art a lying spirit, thou are not the ghost of my )Tj
T*(Fanny. She would never have said any such thing."[18] )Tj
T*( Public interest in the story grew when it was discovered that the ghost )Tj
T*(appeared to follow Elizabeth Parsons. She was removed to the house of a Mr )Tj
T*(Bray, where on 14¬†January, in the presence of two unidentified nobles, more )Tj
T*(knocking sounds were heard.[18] A few days later she was returned to Cock Lane, )Tj
T*(where on 18¬†January another s√©ance was held. In attendance were Kent, the )Tj
T*(apothecary, and local parish priest and incumbent of St John Clerkenwell, )Tj
T*(Reverend Stephen Aldrich.[20] On that occasion, when a clergyman used a candle )Tj
T*(to look under the bed, the ghost "refused" to answer, Frazer claiming "she [the )Tj
T*(ghost] loving not light". After a few minutes of silence the questioning )Tj
T*(continued, but when Moore asked if the ghost would appear in court against )Tj
T*(Kent, Frazer refused to ask the question.[21] )Tj
T*( When they lived at Cock Lane William and Fanny had employed a maid, Esther )Tj
T*("Carrots" Carlisle \(Carrots on account of her red hair\). She had since moved to )Tj
T*(a new job and knew nothing of the haunting, but seeking evidence of Fanny's )Tj
T*(poisoning, Moore went to question her. Carrots told him that Fanny had been )Tj
T*(unable to speak in the days before she died, so Moore invited her to a s√©ance, )Tj
T*(held on 19¬†January. Once there, she was asked to confirm that Fanny had been )Tj
T*(poisoned, but Carrots remained adamant that Fanny had said nothing to her, )Tj
T*(telling the party that William and Fanny had been "very loving, and lived very )Tj
T*(happy together." Kent arrived later that night, this time with James Franzen )Tj
T*(and the Reverends William Dodd and Thomas Broughton. Frazer began with her )Tj
T*(usual introduction before Moore sent her out, apparently irritated by her )Tj
T*(behaviour. He then asked the party of about¬†20 to leave the room, calling them )Tj
T*(back a few minutes later.[22] This time, the s√©ance centred on Carrots, who )Tj
T*(addressed the ghost directly: )Tj
T*( "Are you my mistress?"¬†‚ÄîOne knock, followed by scratches)Tj
T*("Are you angry with me, Madam?"¬†‚ÄîOne knock)Tj
T*("Then I am sure, Madam, you may be ashamed of yourself for I never hurt you in )Tj
T*(my life.")Tj

T*(  At this, the s√©ance was ended. Frazer and Franzen remained alone in the room, )Tj
T*(the latter reportedly too terrified to move. Frazer asked if he would like to )Tj
T*(pray and was angered when he apparently could not. The s√©ance resumed and )Tj
T*(Franzen later returned to his home, where he and his wife were reportedly )Tj
T*(tormented by the ghost's knocking in their bedchamber.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Investigation )Tj
T*( On 20¬†January another s√©ance was held, this time at the home of a Mr Bruin, on )Tj
T*(the corner of nearby Hosier Lane. Among those attending was a man "extremely )Tj
T*(desirous of detecting the fraud, and discovering the truth of this mysterious )Tj
T*(affair", who later sent his account of the night to the London Chronicle. He )Tj
T*(arrived with a small party which included Reverend James Penn of St Ann's in )Tj
T*(Aldersgate. Inside the house, a member of the group positioned himself against )Tj
T*(the bed, but was asked by one of the ghost's sympathisers to move. He refused, )Tj
T*(and following a brief argument the ghost's supporters left. The gentleman then )Tj
T*(asked if Parsons would allow his daughter to be moved to a room at his house, )Tj
T*(but was refused. For the remainder of the night the ghost made no sound, while )Tj
T*(Elizabeth Parsons, now extremely agitated, displayed signs of convulsions. When )Tj
T*(questioned she confirmed that she had seen the ghost, but that she was not )Tj
T*(frightened by it. At that point several of the party left, but at about 7¬†am )Tj
T*(the next morning the knocking once more recommenced. Following the usual )Tj
T*(questions about the cause of Fanny's death and who was responsible, the )Tj
T*(interrogation turned to her body, which lay in the vaults of St John's.[24] )Tj
T*( Parsons agreed to move his daughter to Reverend Aldrich's house for further )Tj
T*(testing on 22¬†January, but when that morning Penn and a man of "veracity and )Tj
T*(fortune" called on Parsons and asked for Elizabeth, the clerk told them she was )Tj
T*(not there and refused to reveal her whereabouts. Parsons had spoken with )Tj
T*(friends and was apparently worried that Kent had been busy with his own )Tj
T*(investigations.[nb 3] Instead, he allowed Elizabeth to be moved that night to )Tj
T*(St Bartholomew's Hospital, where another s√©ance was held. Nothing was reported )Tj
T*(until about 6¬†am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl )Tj
T*(was asleep. The approximately 20-strong audience complained that the affair was )Tj
T*(a deception. Once Elizabeth woke she began to cry, and once reassured that she )Tj
T*(was safe admitted that she was afraid for her father, "who must needs be ruined )Tj
T*(and undone, if their matter should be supposed to be an imposture." She also )Tj
T*(admitted that although she had appeared to be asleep, she was in fact fully )Tj

T*(to intercede, Samuel Fludyer, Lord Mayor of London, was on 23¬†January )Tj
T*(approached by Alderman Gosling, John Moore and Parsons. They told him of their )Tj
T*(experiences but Fludyer was reminded of the then recent case of fraudster )Tj
T*(Elizabeth Canning and refused to have Kent or Parsons arrested \(on charges of )Tj
T*(murder and conspiracy respectively\). Instead, against a backdrop of hysteria )Tj
T*(caused in part by the newspapers' relentless reporting of the case, he ordered )Tj
T*(that Elizabeth be tested at Reverend Aldrich's house. Meanwhile, Elizabeth was )Tj
T*(again the subject of study, in two s√©ances held 23‚Äì24¬†January.[30] Parsons )Tj
T*(accepted the Lord Mayor's decision, but asked that "some persons connected with )Tj
T*(the girl might be permitted to be there, to divert her in the day-time". This )Tj
T*(was refused, as were two similar requests, Aldrich and Penn insisting that they )Tj
T*(would accept only "any person or persons, of strict character and reputation, )Tj
T*(who are housekeepers". Aldrich and Penn's account of their negotiations with )Tj
T*(Parsons clearly perturbed the clerk, as he defended his actions in the Public )Tj
T*(Ledger. This prompted Aldrich and Penn to issue a pointed retort in Lloyd's )Tj
T*(Evening Post: "We are greatly puzzled to find Mr. Parsons asserting that he )Tj
T*(hath been always willing to deliver up the child, when he refused a gentleman )Tj
T*(on Wednesday evening the 20th inst. [...] What is to be understood, by )Tj
T*(requiring security"?[27] )Tj
T*( Elizabeth was taken on 26¬†January to the house of Jane Armstrong, sleeping )Tj
T*(there in a hammock. The continued noises strengthened the resolve of the )Tj
T*(ghost's supporters, while the press's ceaseless reporting of the case )Tj
T*(continued. Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, announced that with the Duke of )Tj
T*(York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke and Lord Hertford, he was to visit )Tj
T*(Cock Lane on 30¬†January. After struggling through the throngs of interested )Tj
T*(visitors though, he was ultimately disappointed; the Public Advertiser observed )Tj
T*(that "the noise is now generally deferred till seven in the morning, it being )Tj
T*(necessary to vary the time, that the imposition may be the better carried )Tj
T*(on".[31] )Tj
T*( [edit] Exposure )Tj
T*( With Lord Dartmouth Aldrich began to draw together the people who would be )Tj
T*(involved in his investigation. They chose the matron of a local lying-in )Tj
T*(hospital as principal lady-in-waiting, the critic and controversialist Bishop )Tj
T*(John Douglas, and Dr George Macaulay. A Captain Wilkinson was also included on )Tj
T*(the committee; he had attended one s√©ance armed with a pistol and stick; the )Tj
T*(former to shoot the source of the knocking, and the latter to make his escape )Tj
T*(\(the ghost had remained silent on that occasion\). James Penn and John Moore )Tj
T*(were also on the committee, but its most prominent member was Dr Samuel )Tj
T*(Johnson,[32] who documented the s√©ance, held on 1¬†February 1762: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(On the night of the 1st of February many gentlemen eminent for their rank and )Tj
T*(character were, by the invitation of the Reverend Mr. Aldrich, of Clerkenwell, )Tj
T*(assembled at his house, for the examination of the noises supposed to be made )Tj
T*(by a departed spirit, for the detection of some enormous crime. About ten at )Tj
T*(night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl, supposed to be )Tj
T*(disturbed by a spirit, had, with proper caution, been put to bed by several )Tj
T*(ladies. They sat rather more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went down )Tj
T*(stairs, when they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied, in the )Tj
T*(strongest terms, any knowledge or belief of fraud. The supposed spirit had )Tj
T*(before publickly promised, by an affirmative knock, that it would attend one of )Tj
T*(the gentlemen into the vault under the Church of St. John, Clerkenwell, where )Tj
T*(the body is deposited, and give a token of her presence there, by a knock upon )Tj
T*(her coffin; it was therefore determined to make this trial of the existence or )Tj
T*(veracity of the supposed spirit. While they were enquiring and deliberating, )Tj
T*(they were summoned into the girl's chamber by some ladies who were near her )Tj
T*(bed, and who had heard knocks and scratches. When the gentlemen entered, the )Tj
T*(girl declared that she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back, and was )Tj
T*(required to hold her hands out of bed. From that time, though the spirit was )Tj
T*(very solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance, by impression )Tj

T*(no evidence of any preter-natural power was exhibited. The spirit was then very )Tj

T*(the coffin, was then about to visit the vault, and that the performance of the )Tj
T*(promise was then claimed. The company at one o'clock went into the church, and )Tj
T*(the gentleman to whom the promise was made, went with another into the vault. )Tj
T*(The spirit was solemnly required to perform its promise, but nothing more than )Tj
T*(silence ensued: the person supposed to be accused by the spirit, then went down )Tj
T*(with several others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return they )Tj
T*(examined the girl, but could draw no confession from her. Between two and three )Tj
T*(she desired and was permitted to go home with her father. It is, therefore, the )Tj
T*(opinion of the whole assembly, that the child has some art of making or )Tj
T*(counterfeiting a particular noise, and that there is no agency of any higher )Tj
T*(cause.)Tj
T*(‚Äî Samuel Johnson \(1762\)[33])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Disappointed that the ghost had failed to reveal itself, Moore now told Kent )Tj
T*(he believed it was an imposter, and that he would help reveal it. Kent asked )Tj
T*(him to admit the truth and write an affidavit of what he knew, so as to end the )Tj
T*(affair and restore Kent's reputation, but Moore refused, telling him that he )Tj
T*(still believed that the spirit's presence was a reminder of his sin.[34][nb 4] )Tj
T*(Moore's view of the couple's relationship was shared by many, including Mrs )Tj
T*(Parsons, who believed that the supposed ghost of Elizabeth Kent had disapproved )Tj
T*(of her sister's new relationship.[36] )Tj
T*( Another s√©ance on 3¬†February saw the knocking continue unabated, but by then )Tj
T*(Parsons was in an extremely difficult‚Äîand serious‚Äîsituation. Keen to prove the )Tj
T*(ghost was not an imposture he allowed his daughter to be examined at a house on )Tj
T*(The Strand from 7‚Äì10¬†February, and at another house in Covent Garden from 14¬†)Tj
T*(February. There she was tested in a variety of ways which included being swung )Tj
T*(up in a hammock, her hands and feet extended. As expected, the noises )Tj
T*(commenced, but stopped once Elizabeth was made to place her hands outside the )Tj
T*(bed. For two nights the ghost was silent. Elizabeth was told that if no more )Tj
T*(noises were heard by Sunday 21¬†February, she and her father would be committed )Tj
T*(to Newgate Prison. Her maids then saw her conceal on her person a small piece )Tj
T*(of wood about 6¬†by 4¬†inches \(150 by 100¬†mm\), and informed the investigators. )Tj
T*(More scratches were heard but the observers concluded that Elizabeth was )Tj
T*(responsible for the noises, and that she had been forced by her father to make )Tj
T*(them. Elizabeth was allowed home shortly after.[37][38] )Tj
T*( On or about 25¬†February, a pamphlet sympathetic to Kent's case was published, )Tj
T*(called The Mystery Revealed, and most likely written by Oliver Goldsmith.[39] )Tj
T*(Meanwhile, Kent was still trying to clear his name, and on 25¬†February he went )Tj
T*(to the vault of St John's, accompanied by Aldrich, the undertaker, the clerk )Tj
T*(and the parish sexton. The group was there to prove beyond any doubt that a )Tj
T*(recent newspaper report, which claimed that the supposed removal of Fanny's )Tj
T*(body from the vault accounted for the ghost's failure to knock on her coffin, )Tj
T*(was false. The undertaker removed the lid to expose Fanny's corpse, "and a very )Tj
T*(awful shocking sight it was".[40] For Moore this was too much and he published )Tj
T*(his retraction: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(In justice to the person, whose reputation has been attacked in a most gross )Tj
T*(manner, by the pretended Ghost in Cock-lane; to check the credulity of the )Tj

T*(the least ground of suspicion, but has preserved that becoming steadfastness, )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( It was not enough to keep him from being charged by the authorities with )Tj
T*(conspiracy, along with Richard Parsons and his wife, Mary Frazer, and Richard )Tj
T*(James, a tradesman.[42] )Tj
T*( The trial of all five was held at the Guild Hall in London on 10¬†July 1762. )Tj
T*(Presiding over the case was Lord Chief Justice William Murray. Proceedings )Tj
T*(began at 10¬†am, "brought by William Kent against the above defendants for a )Tj
T*(conspiracy to take away his life by charging him with the murder of Frances )Tj
T*(Lynes by giving her poison whereof she died". The courtroom was crowded with )Tj
T*(spectators, who watched as Kent gave evidence against those in the dock. He )Tj
T*(told the court about his relationship with Fanny and of her resurrection as )Tj
T*("Scratching Fanny" \(so-called because of the scratching noises made by the )Tj
T*("ghost"\).[7] James Franzen was next on the stand, his story corroborated by )Tj
T*(Fanny's servant, Esther "Carrots" Carlisle, who testified later that day. Dr )Tj
T*(Cooper, who had served Fanny as she lay dying, told the court that he had )Tj
T*(always believed the strange noises in Cock Lane to be a trick, and his account )Tj
T*(of Fanny's illness was supported by her apothecary, James Jones. Several other )Tj
T*(prosecution witnesses described how the hoax had been revealed, and Richard )Tj
T*(James was accused by the prosecution's last witness of being responsible for )Tj
T*(some of the more offensive material published in the Public Ledger.[43] )Tj
T*( The defence's witnesses included some of those who had cared for Elizabeth )Tj
T*(Parsons, and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. Other )Tj
T*(witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from )Tj
T*(Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had )Tj
T*(left the property. One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into )Tj
T*(laughter, at which she replied "I assure you gentlemen, it is no laughing )Tj
T*(matter, whatever you may think of it." Reverend Thomas Broughton was also )Tj
T*(called, as was Reverend Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. Judge )Tj
T*(Murray asked him "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had )Tj
T*(puzzled him?" John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and )Tj
T*(presented Murray with a letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas )Tj
T*(Secker, who sought to intercede on his behalf. Murray placed the letter in his )Tj
T*(pocket, unopened, and told the court "it was impossible it could relate to the )Tj
T*(cause in question." Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support )Tj
T*(from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink )Tj
T*(problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.[43] )Tj
T*( The trial ended at about 9:30¬†pm. The judge spent about 90¬†minutes summing up )Tj
T*(the case, but it took the jury only 15¬†minutes to reach a verdict of guilty for )Tj
T*(all five defendants. The following Monday, two others responsible for defaming )Tj
T*(Kent were found guilty and later fined ¬£50 each. The conspirators were brought )Tj
T*(back on 22¬†November but sentencing was delayed in the hope that they could )Tj
T*(agree on the level of damages payable to Kent. Having failed to do so they )Tj
T*(returned on 27¬†January 1763 and were committed to the King's Bench Prison until )Tj
T*(11¬†February, by which time John Moore and Richard James had agreed to pay Kent )Tj
T*(¬£588; they were subsequently admonished by Justice Wilmot and released. The )Tj
T*(following day, the rest were sentenced:[44] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The Court chusing that Mr. Kent, who had been so much injured on the occasion, )Tj
T*(should receive some reparation by punishment of the offenders, deferred giving )Tj
T*(judgment for seven or eight months, in hopes that the parties might make it up )Tj
T*(in the meantime. Accordingly, the clergyman, and tradesman agreed to pay Mr. )Tj
T*(Kent a round sum‚Äîsome say between ¬£500 and ¬£600 to purchase their pardon, and )Tj
T*(were, therefore, dismissed with a severe reprimand. The father was ordered to )Tj

T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( The Cock Lane ghost was a focus for a contemporary religious controversy )Tj
T*(between the Methodists, and the orthodox Anglicans. Belief in a spiritual )Tj
T*(afterlife is a requirement for most religions, and in every instance where a )Tj
T*(spirit had supposedly manifested itself in the real world, the event was )Tj
T*(cherished as an affirmation of such beliefs.[47] In his youth, John Wesley had )Tj
T*(been strongly influenced by a supposed haunting at his family home and these )Tj
T*(experiences were carried through to the religion he founded, which was )Tj
T*(regularly criticised for its position on witchcraft and magic. Methodism, )Tj
T*(although far from a united religion, became almost synonymous with a belief in )Tj
T*(the supernatural.[48] Some of its followers therefore gave more credence to the )Tj
T*(reality of the Cock Lane ghost than did the Anglican establishment, which )Tj
T*(considered such things to be relics of the country's Catholic past. This was a )Tj
T*(view that was epitomised in the conflict between the Methodist John Moore and )Tj
T*(the Anglican Stephen Aldrich.[49] In his 1845 memoirs, Horace Walpole, who had )Tj
T*(attended one of the s√©ances, accused the Methodists of actively working to )Tj
T*(establish the existence of ghosts. He described the constant presence of )Tj
T*(Methodist clergymen near Elizabeth Parsons and implied that the church would )Tj
T*(recompense her father for his troubles.[50] )Tj
T*( Samuel Johnson was committed to his Christian faith and shared the views of )Tj
T*(author Joseph Glanvill, who, in his 1681 work Saducismus Triumphatus, wrote of )Tj
T*(his concern over the advances made against religion and a belief in witchcraft, )Tj
T*(by atheism and scepticism. For Johnson the idea that an afterlife might not )Tj
T*(exist was an appalling thought, but although he thought that spirits could )Tj
T*(protect and counsel those still living, he kept himself distant from the more )Tj
T*(credulous Methodists, and recognised that his religion required proof of an )Tj
T*(afterlife.[51] Ever a sceptic, in his discussions with his biographer James )Tj
T*(Boswell, he said: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Sir, I make a distinction between what a man may experience by the mere )Tj
T*(strength of his imagination, and what imagination cannot possibly produce. )Tj
T*(Thus, suppose I should think I saw a form, and heard a voice cry, "Johnson, you )Tj
T*(are a very wicked fellow, and unless you repent you will certainly be )Tj
T*(punished;" my own unworthiness is so deeply impressed upon my mind, that I )Tj
T*(might imagine I thus saw and heard, and therefore I should not believe that an )Tj
T*(external communication had been made to me. But if a form should appear, and a )Tj
T*(voice tell me that a particular man had died at a particular place, and a )Tj
T*(particular hour, a fact which I had no apprehension of, nor any means of )Tj
T*(knowing, and this fact, with all its circumstances, should afterwards be )Tj
T*(unquestionably proved, I should, in that case, be persuaded that I had )Tj
T*(supernatural intelligence imparted to me.[52])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Johnson's role in revealing the nature of the hoax was not enough to keep the )Tj
T*(satirist Charles Churchill from mocking his apparent credulity in his 1762 work )Tj
T*(The Ghost.[53] He resented Johnson's lack of enthusiasm for his writing and )Tj
T*(with the character of 'Pomposo', written as one of the more credulous of the )Tj
T*(ghost's investigators, used the satire to highlight a "superstitious streak" in )Tj
T*(his subject. Johnson paid this scant attention, but was said to have been more )Tj

T*(upset when Churchill again mocked him for his delay in releasing )Tj
T*(Shakespeare.[54] Publishers were at first wary of attacking those involved in )Tj
T*(the supposed haunting, but Churchill's satire was one of a number of )Tj
T*(publications which, following the exposure of Parsons' deception, heaped scorn )Tj
T*(on the affair. The newspapers searched for evidence of past impostures and )Tj
T*(referenced older publications such as Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft )Tj
T*(\(1584\).[55] The ghost was referenced in an anonymous work entitled )Tj
T*(Anti-Canidia: or, Superstition Detected and Exposed \(1762\), which sought to )Tj
T*(ridicule the credulity of those involved in the Cock Lane case. The author )Tj
T*(described his work as a "sally of indignation at the contemptible wonder in )Tj
T*(Cock-lane".[56] Works such as The Orators \(1762\) by Samuel Foote, were soon )Tj
T*(available.[57][58] Farcical poems such as Cock-lane Humbug were released, )Tj
T*(theatres staged plays such as The Drummer, and The Haunted House.[59] )Tj
T*( Oliver Goldsmith, who had in February 1762 published The Mystery Revealed, may )Tj
T*(also have been responsible for the satirical illustration, English Credulity or )Tj
T*(the Invisible Ghost \(1762\). It shows a s√©ance as envisioned by the artist, with )Tj
T*(the ghost hovering above the heads of the two children in the bed. To the right )Tj
T*(of the bed a woman deep in prayer exclaims "O! that they would lay it in the )Tj
T*(Red Sea!" Another cries "I shall never have any rest again". The English )Tj
T*(magistrate and social reformer John Fielding, who was blind, is pictured )Tj
T*(entering from the left saying "I should be glad to see this spirit", while his )Tj
T*(companion says "Your W‚Äî‚Äîr's had better get your Warrant back'd by his L‚Äîrds‚Äîp", )Tj
T*(referring to a Middlesex magistrate's warrant which required an endorsement )Tj
T*(from the Lord Mayor, Samuel Fludyer. A man in tall boots, whip in hand, says: )Tj
T*("Ay Tom I'll lay 6¬†to¬†1 it runs more nights than the Coronation"[nb 5] and his )Tj
T*(companion remarks "How they swallow the hum". A clergymen says "I saw the light )Tj
T*(on the Clock" while another asks "Now thou Infidel does thou not believe?", )Tj
T*(prompting his neighbour to reply "Yes if it had happen'd sooner 't would have )Tj
T*(serv'd me for a new Charater in the Lyar the Story would tell better than the )Tj
T*(Cat &amp; Kittens".[nb 6] Another clergyman exclaims "If a Gold Watch knock 3¬†)Tj
T*(times", and a Parson asks him "Brother don't disturb it". On the wall, an image )Tj
T*(of The Bottle Conjuror is alongside an image of Elizabeth Canning, whose fraud )Tj
T*(had so worried Samuel Fludyer that he had refused to arrest either Parsons or )Tj
T*(Kent.[62] )Tj
T*( Playwright David Garrick dedicated the enormously successful The Farmer's )Tj
T*(Return to the satirical artist William Hogarth. The story concerns a farmer who )Tj
T*(regales his family with an account of his talk with Miss Fanny, the comedy )Tj
T*(being derived from the reversal of traditional roles: the sceptical farmer )Tj
T*(poking fun at the credulous city-folk.[59][63] Hogarth made his own )Tj
T*(observations of the Cock Lane ghost, with obvious references in Credulity, )Tj
T*(Superstition and Fanaticism \(1762\). This illustration makes a point of )Tj
T*(attacking Methodist ministers, one of whom is seen to slip a phallic "ghost" )Tj
T*(into a young woman's bodice.[46] He again attacked the Methodists in The Times, )Tj
T*(Plate¬†2 \(1762‚Äì1763\), placing an image of Thomas Secker \(who had tried to )Tj
T*(intervene on behalf of the Methodists\) behind the Cock Lane ghost, and putting )Tj
T*(the ghost in the same pillory as the radical politician John Wilkes, which )Tj
T*(implied a connection between the demagoguery surrounding the Methodists and )Tj
T*(Pittites.[64][65] The print enraged Bishop William Warburton, who although a )Tj
T*(vocal critic of Methodism, wrote: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I have seen Hogarth's print of the Ghost. It is a horrid composition of lewd )Tj

T*(Alice Springs. )Tj
T*( Minnie began painting in 2000 at about the age of 80, and her pictures soon )Tj
T*(became popular and sought-after works of contemporary Indigenous Australian )Tj
T*(art. In the years after she took up painting on canvas, until she died in 2006, )Tj
T*(Minnie's works were exhibited around Australia and collected by major )Tj
T*(galleries, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery )Tj
T*(of Victoria and the Queensland Art Gallery. With popularity came pressure from )Tj
T*(those keen to acquire her work. She was allegedly "kidnapped" by people who )Tj
T*(wanted her to paint for them, and there have been media reports of her work )Tj
T*(being forged. Minnie's work is often compared with that of her sister-in-law )Tj
T*(Emily Kame Kngwarreye, who also came from the Sandover and took up acrylic )Tj
T*(painting late in life. Minnie's daughter, Barbara Weir, is a respected artist )Tj
T*(in her own right. )Tj
T*( [edit] Personal life )Tj
T*( Minnie was born in the early 20th century near Utopia, Northern Territory, 300 )Tj
T*(kilometres \(190¬†mi\) north-east of Alice Springs, Northern Territory.[3] Utopia )Tj
T*(was a cattle station that was returned to Indigenous ownership in the late )Tj
T*(1970s.[4] It is part of a broader region known as the Sandover, containing )Tj
T*(about 20¬†Indigenous outstations and centred on the Sandover River.[5] Minnie )Tj
T*(was one of the traditional owners of Utopia station recognised in the 1980 )Tj
T*(Indigenous land claim made over the property;[1] her particular country was )Tj
T*(known as Atnwengerrp.[3] )Tj
T*( Pwerle \(in the Anmatyerre language\) or Apwerle \(in Alyawarr\) is a skin name, )Tj
T*(one of 16 used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of )Tj
T*(central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships )Tj
T*(that influence preferred marriage partners, and may be associated with )Tj
T*(particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not )Tj
T*(surnames in the sense used by Europeans.[6][7] Thus "Minnie" is the element of )Tj
T*(the artist's name that is specifically hers. )Tj
T*( Estimates of Minnie's birthdate vary widely. The National Gallery of Victoria )Tj
T*(estimates around 1915;[2] Birnberg's biographical survey of Indigenous artists )Tj
T*(from central Australia gives a birth date of around 1920;[8]The new McCulloch's )Tj
T*(Encyclopedia of Australian Art suggests around 1922;[3] Elizabeth Fortescue's )Tj
T*(biographical essay in Art of Utopia offers a range between 1910 and 1920.[9] )Tj
T*(The uncertainty arises because Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of )Tj
T*(birth by comparison with other events, especially for those born before contact )Tj
T*(with European Australians.[10] Minnie was one of six children, and had three )Tj
T*(sisters: Molly, born around 1920, Emily, born around 1922, and Galya, born in )Tj
T*(the 1930s.[9] She was of the Anmatyerre and Alyawarre Aboriginal language )Tj
T*(groups.[2][8] )Tj
T*( In about 1945, Minnie had an affair with a married man,[11] Jack Weir, )Tj
T*(described by one source as a pastoral station owner,[3] by a second as "an )Tj
T*(Irish Australian man who owned a cattle run called Bundy River Station", and by )Tj
T*(another as an Irish "stockman".[12] A relationship such as that between Minnie )Tj
T*(and Weir was illegal, and the pair were jailed; Weir died shortly after his )Tj
T*(release.[12] Minnie had a child from their liaison, who was partly raised by )Tj
T*(Minnie's sister-in-law, artist Emily Kngwarreye,[13][14] and became prominent )Tj
T*(Indigenous artist Barbara Weir. Barbara Weir was one of the Stolen Generations. )Tj
T*(At about the age of nine, she was forcibly taken from her family, who believed )Tj
T*(she had then been killed. The family were reunited in the late 1960s, but )Tj
T*(Barbara did not form a close bond with Minnie. Barbara married Mervyn Torres, )Tj
T*(and as of 2000 had six children and thirteen grandchildren.[9][12][15] )Tj

T*( [edit] Career )Tj
T*( In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became well known for the design and production )Tj
T*(of batiks.[21] By 1981 there were 50¬†artists at Utopia creating batik )Tj
T*(works;[22] 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the )Tj
T*(Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association.[4] Although several sources )Tj
T*(comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved )Tj
T*(to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist )Tj
T*(before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief )Tj
T*(biography suggests that she did not participate in the making of batik, but she )Tj
T*(was aware of it.[2] )Tj
T*( When Minnie decided to take up painting in 2000, the reception was immediately )Tj
T*(positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's )Tj
T*(Flinders Lane Gallery.[3] She was first selected to exhibit in the National )Tj
T*(Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002.[23] One of her pieces, )Tj
T*(Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was )Tj
T*(given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl \(Pwerle\). The artist's asking price for the )Tj
T*(picture, A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for )Tj
T*(an artist from the central and western deserts.[24] Her painting Awelye )Tj
T*(Atnwengerrp 2 was exhibited in the 2005 competition.[25] She was named by )Tj
T*(Australian Art Collector as one of Australia's 50 most collectible artists in )Tj
T*(2004.[26] )Tj
T*( There were many group and solo exhibitions of Minnie's work at private )Tj
T*(galleries between 2000 and 2006. These included exhibitions at Japinka Gallery )Tj
T*(in Western Australia in 2003 and 2005,[27] Adelaide's Dacou Gallery in 2000 and )Tj
T*(2002,[23] Sydney's Gallery Savah between 2000 and 2002 as well as in 2006,[28] )Tj
T*(and Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery in 2000, 2004 and 2006, the last of which )Tj
T*(was a joint exhibition conducted with her three sisters,[29] all of whom are )Tj
T*(artists in their own right.[3][9] )Tj
T*( Desert art specialist Professor Vivien Johnson noted that Minnie was one of )Tj
T*(the Utopia artists whose style was "radically different from [that of] all the )Tj
T*(other painting communities in the Western Desert‚Äîand stunningly successful in )Tj
T*(the market place".[30] Her most famous fellow artist was Emily Kngwarreye, )Tj
T*(whose painting Earth's Creation in 2007 sold for over $1 million, setting a )Tj
T*(record for the price paid for a painting by an Indigenous Australian )Tj
T*(artist.[31] Unlike Minnie, Emily had been an active participant in the early )Tj
T*(batik movement at Utopia.[32] )Tj
T*( Minnie \(like Emily\) was often placed under considerable pressure to produce )Tj
T*(works.[3] She was reportedly "kidnapped" by people "keen to go to often quite )Tj
T*(bizarre lengths to acquire" her work.[3] Minnie's experience reflected broader )Tj
T*(issues in the industry surrounding artists, who were often older, had limited )Tj
T*(education or English language ability, and faced serious poverty both )Tj
T*(themselves and amongst their families.[33] In addition to being pressured to )Tj
T*(paint by others, there were media reports suggesting that some of the vast )Tj
T*(number of paintings traded under Minnie's name were not created by her at )Tj
T*(all.[34][35] )Tj
T*( [edit] Style of painting )Tj
T*( Minnie's style was spontaneous, and typified by "bold" and "vibrant" colour )Tj
T*(executed with great freedom.[8][36] Her works, such as Anunapa, Akali held by )Tj
T*(the National Gallery of Victoria, were executed in acrylic \(often referred to )Tj
T*(as synthetic polymer\) paint on canvas.[2] As with other contemporary artists of )Tj
T*(the central and western deserts, her paintings included depictions of stories )Tj
T*(or features for which she had responsibility within her family or clan, such as )Tj
T*(the Awelye Atnwengerrp dreaming \(or Women's Dreaming\). Indigenous art expert )Tj

T*(of recognisable traditional motifs‚Äîsuch as animal tracks‚Äîin the works of )Tj
T*(Western Desert artists.[37] Brisbane artist and gallerist Michael Eather has )Tj
T*(likened her work not only to that of Emily, but also to Australian abstract )Tj
T*(impressionist artist Tony Tuckson.[38] )Tj
T*( Minnie's paintings include two main design themes. The first is free-flowing )Tj
T*(and parallel lines in a pendulous outline, depicting the body painting designs )Tj
T*(used in women's ceremonies, or awelye.[8][9] The second theme involves circular )Tj
T*(shapes, used to symbolise bush tomato \(Solanum chippendalei\), bush melon, and )Tj
T*(northern wild orange \(Capparis umbonata\), among a number of forms of bushfood )Tj
T*(represented in her works.[9][36] Together, the designs were characterised by )Tj
T*(one reviewer as "broad, luminescent flowing lines and circles".[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( Minnie's art was quickly added to major public collections such as the Art )Tj
T*(Gallery of NSW, Art Gallery of South Australia, National Gallery of Victoria )Tj
T*(and Queensland Art Gallery.[3] It was also included in a 2009 exhibition of )Tj
T*(Indigenous Australian painting at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.[39] )Tj
T*(Her works later formed the basis of a series of designer rugs,[40] and, )Tj
T*(together with paintings by her sisters, illustrated the cover of art critic )Tj
T*(Benjamin Genocchio's book, Dollar Dreaming.[41] Described by art dealer Hank )Tj
T*(Ebes as the works of "a genius", Minnie's paintings were typically selling for )Tj
T*($5,000 in 2005; the highest price fetched on the secondary market at that time )Tj
T*(was $43,000.[38] )Tj
T*( Regarded as one of Australia's leading contemporary women artists, Minnie )Tj
T*(ranks alongside other notable Indigenous female painters Dorothy Napangardi, )Tj
T*(Gloria Petyarre and Kathleen Petyarre.[42][43] One of a number of women such as )Tj
T*(Emily Kngwarreye who dominated central and western desert painting in the first )Tj

T*( Diane Keaton \(born Diane Hall; January 5, 1946\) is an American film actress, )Tj
T*(director, producer, and screenwriter. Keaton began her career on stage, and )Tj
T*(made her screen debut in 1970. Her first major film role was as Kay )Tj
T*(Adams-Corleone in The Godfather \(1972\), but the films that shaped her early )Tj
T*(career were those with director and co-star Woody Allen beginning with Play It )Tj
T*(Again, Sam in 1972. Her next two films with Allen, Sleeper \(1973\) and Love and )Tj
T*(Death \(1975\), established her as a comic actor. Her fourth, Annie Hall \(1977\), )Tj
T*(won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. )Tj
T*( Keaton subsequently expanded her range to avoid becoming typecast as her Annie )Tj
T*(Hall persona. She became an accomplished dramatic performer, starring in )Tj
T*(Looking for Mr. Goodbar \(1977\) and received Academy Award nominations for Reds )Tj
T*(\(1981\) and Marvin's Room \(1996\). Some of her popular later films include Baby )Tj
T*(Boom \(1987\), Father of the Bride \(1991\), The First Wives Club \(1996\), )Tj
T*(Something's Gotta Give \(2003\) and The Family Stone \(2005\). Keaton's films have )Tj
T*(earned a cumulative gross of over US$1.1¬†billion in North America.[1] In )Tj
T*(addition to acting, she is also a photographer, real estate developer, author, )Tj
T*(and occasional singer. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early life and education )Tj
T*( Keaton was born as Diane Hall on January 5, 1946 in Los Angeles, )Tj
T*(California.[2] Her mother, Dorothy Deanne \(n√©e Keaton; 1921‚Äì2008\), was a )Tj
T*(homemaker and amateur photographer; her father, Jack Newton Ignatius Hall )Tj
T*(\(1921‚Äì1990\), was a real estate broker and civil engineer.[2][3] Her father, )Tj
T*(from Nebraska, came from an Irish-American Catholic background, and her mother, )Tj
T*(originally from Kansas, came from a Methodist family. Keaton was raised a )Tj
T*(Methodist by her mother.[4] Her first ambition to become an actress came after )Tj
T*(seeing her mother win the "Mrs. Los Angeles" pageant for homemakers. Keaton has )Tj

T*(playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.[6] )Tj
T*( Keaton is a 1963 graduate of Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California. )Tj
T*(During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, )Tj
T*(and starred as Blanche DuBois in a school production of A Streetcar Named )Tj
T*(Desire. After graduation, she attended Santa Ana College, and later Orange )Tj
T*(Coast College as an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an )Tj
T*(entertainment career in Manhattan.[7] Upon joining the Actors' Equity )Tj
T*(Association, she adopted the surname of Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as )Tj
T*(there was already a registered Diane Hall.[8] For a brief time, she also )Tj
T*(moonlighted at nightclubs with a singing act.[9] She would later revisit her )Tj
T*(nightclub act in Annie Hall \(1977\) and a cameo in Radio Days \(1987\). )Tj
T*( Keaton began studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. )Tj
T*(She initially studied acting under the Meisner technique, an ensemble acting )Tj
T*(technique first evolved in the 1930s by Sanford Meisner, a New York stage )Tj
T*(actor/acting coach/director who had been a member of The Group Theater )Tj
T*(\(1931‚Äì1940\). She has described her acting technique as, "[being] only as good )Tj
T*(as the person you're acting with ... As opposed to going it on my own and )Tj
T*(forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I )Tj
T*(always need the help of everyone!"[9] According to her Reds co-star Warren )Tj
T*(Beatty, "She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire )Tj
T*(script memorized before you start doing the movie, which I don't know any other )Tj
T*(actors doing that."[10] )Tj
T*( In 1968, Keaton became a member of the "Tribe" and understudy to Sheila in the )Tj
T*(original Broadway production of Hair.[11] She gained some notoriety for her )Tj
T*(refusal to disrobe at the end of Act I when the cast performs nude, even though )Tj
T*(nudity in the production was optional for actors \(Those who performed nude )Tj
T*(received a $50 bonus\).[5][12] After acting in Hair for nine months, she )Tj
T*(auditioned for a part in Woody Allen's production of Play It Again, Sam. After )Tj
T*(nearly being passed over for being too tall \(at 5¬†ft 8 in./1.73¬†m she is two )Tj
T*(inches/5¬†cm taller than Allen\), she won the part.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] Career )Tj
T*( After being nominated for a Tony Award for Play It Again, Sam, Keaton made her )Tj
T*(film debut in 1970's Lovers and Other Strangers. She followed with guest roles )Tj
T*(on the television series Love, American Style and Night Gallery, and Mannix. )Tj
T*(Between films, Keaton appeared in a series of deodorant commercials. )Tj
T*( Keaton's breakthrough role came two years later when she was cast as Kay )Tj
T*(Adams, the girlfriend and eventual wife of Michael Corleone \(played by Al )Tj
T*(Pacino\) in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 blockbuster The Godfather. Coppola noted )Tj
T*(that he first noticed Keaton in Lovers and Other Strangers, and cast her )Tj
T*(because of her reputation for eccentricity that he wanted her to bring to the )Tj
T*(role[13] \(Keaton claims that at the time she was commonly referred to as "the )Tj
T*(kooky actress" of the film industry\).[5] Her performance in the film was )Tj
T*(loosely based on her real life experience of making the film, both of which she )Tj
T*(has described as being "the woman in a world of men".[5]The Godfather was an )Tj
T*(unparalleled critical and financial success, becoming the highest grossing film )Tj
T*(of the year and winning the Best Picture Oscar of 1972. )Tj
T*( Two years later she reprised her role as Kay Adams in The Godfather Part II. )Tj
T*(She was initially reluctant, stating that, "At first, I was skeptical about )Tj
T*(playing Kay again in the Godfather sequel. But when I read the script, the )Tj
T*(character seemed much more substantial than in the first movie."[7] In Part II )Tj
T*(her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her )Tj
T*(husband's activities. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the )Tj
T*(films, her character's importance was minimal. Time wrote that she was )Tj
T*("invisible in The Godfather and pallid in The Godfather, Part II."[14] )Tj
T*( Keaton's other notable films of the 1970s included many collaborations with )Tj
T*(Woody Allen. Although by the time they made films together, their romantic )Tj
T*(involvement had ended, she played many eccentric characters in several of his )Tj
T*(comic and dramatic films including Sleeper, Love and Death, Interiors, )Tj

T*(Ross. Allen has credited Keaton as his muse during his early film career.[15] )Tj
T*( In 1977, Keaton starred with Allen in the romantic comedy Annie Hall, one of )Tj
T*(her most famous roles. Annie Hall was written and directed by Allen and the )Tj
T*(film was believed to be autobiographical of his relationship with Keaton. Allen )Tj
T*(based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton \("Annie" is a nickname of )Tj
T*(hers, and "Hall" is her original surname\). Many of Keaton's mannerisms and her )Tj
T*(self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. \(Director )Tj
T*(Nancy Meyers has claimed "Diane's the most self-deprecating person alive".[16]\) )Tj
T*(Keaton has also said that Allen wrote the character as an "idealized version" )Tj
T*(of herself.[17] The two starred as a frequently on-again, off-again couple )Tj
T*(living in New York City. Her acting was later summed up by CNN as "awkward, )Tj
T*(self-deprecating, speaking in endearing little whirlwinds of semi-logic",[18] )Tj
T*(and by Allen as a "nervous breakdown in slow motion."[19] The film was both a )Tj
T*(major financial and critical success, and won the Academy Award for Best )Tj
T*(Picture. Keaton's performance also won the Academy Award for Best Actress. In )Tj
T*(2006, Premiere magazine ranked Keaton in Annie Hall as 60th on its list of the )Tj
T*("100 Greatest Performances of All Time": )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(It's hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy )Tj
T*(backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, )Tj
T*(intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, )Tj
T*(especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy \(Woody Allen\) while )Tj
T*(the subtitle reads, 'He probably thinks I'm a yoyo.' Yo-yo¬†? Hardly.[20])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Keaton's eccentric wardrobe in Annie Hall, which consisted mainly of vintage )Tj
T*(men's clothing, including neckties, vests, baggy pants, and fedora hats, made )Tj
T*(her an unlikely fashion icon of the late 1970s. Most of the clothing seen in )Tj
T*(the film came from Keaton herself, who was already known for her tomboyish )Tj
T*(clothing style years before Annie Hall, though Ruth Morley and Ralph Lauren )Tj
T*(reportedly worked on the movie's costume.[7][21] Soon after the film's release, )Tj
T*(men's clothing and pantsuits became popular attire for women.[22] She is known )Tj
T*(to favor men's vintage clothing, and usually appears in public wearing gloves )Tj
T*(and conservative attire. \(A 2005 profile in the San Francisco Chronicle )Tj
T*(described her as "easy to find. Look for the only woman in sight dressed in a )Tj
T*(turtleneck on a 90-degree afternoon in Pasadena.[23]\) Keaton would later )Tj
T*(reprise her Annie Hall appearance when she attended the 2003 Academy Awards )Tj
T*(presentation in a men's tuxedo and a bowler hat. )Tj
T*( Her photo by Douglas Kirkland appeared on the cover of the September 26, 1977, )Tj
T*(issue Time magazine with the story dubbing her "the funniest woman now working )Tj
T*(in films."[14] Later that year, she departed from her usual lighthearted comic )Tj
T*(roles when she won the highly coveted lead role in the drama Looking for Mr. )Tj
T*(Goodbar, based on the novel by Judith Rossner. In the film she played a )Tj
T*(Catholic schoolteacher for deaf children who lives a double life, spending )Tj
T*(nights frequenting singles bars and engaging in promiscuous sex. Keaton became )Tj
T*(interested in the role after seeing it as a "psychological case history."[24] )Tj
T*(The same issue of Time commended her role choice and criticized the restricted )Tj
T*(roles available for female actors in American films: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(A male actor can fly a plane, fight a war, shoot a badman, pull off a sting, )Tj
T*(impersonate a big cheese in business or politics. Men are presumed to be )Tj
T*(interesting. A female can play a wife, play a whore, get pregnant, lose her )Tj
T*(baby, and, um, let's see ... Women are presumed to be dull. ... Now a )Tj
T*(determined trend spotter can point to a handful of new films whose makers think )Tj
T*(that women can bear the dramatic weight of a production alone, or virtually so. )Tj
T*(Then there is Diane Keaton in Looking for Mr. Goodbar. As Theresa Dunn, Keaton )Tj
T*(dominates this raunchy, risky, violent dramatization of Judith Rossner's 1975 )Tj
T*(novel about a schoolteacher who cruises singles bars.[14])Tj

T*(1977, she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished record )Tj
T*(never materialized.[3] )Tj
T*( Keaton met with more success in the medium of still photography. Like her )Tj
T*(character in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite )Tj
T*(hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling )Tj
T*(in the late 1970s she began exploring her avocation more seriously. "Rolling )Tj
T*(Stone had asked me to take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, )Tj
T*(what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in )Tj
T*(these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. "These )Tj
T*(places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It )Tj
T*(was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me." )Tj
T*(Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in )Tj
T*(book form in 1980.[26] )Tj
T*( After Manhattan in 1979, Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working )Tj
T*(relationship, and the film would be their last major collaboration until 1993. )Tj
T*(In 1978, Keaton became romantically involved with Warren Beatty, and two years )Tj
T*(later he cast her to play opposite him in Reds. In the film, she played Louise )Tj
T*(Bryant, a journalist and feminist, who flees from her husband to work with )Tj
T*(radical journalist John Reed \(Beatty\), and later enters Russia to locate him as )Tj
T*(he chronicles the Russian Civil War. The New York Times wrote that Keaton was, )Tj
T*("nothing less than splendid as Louise Bryant¬†‚Äì beautiful, selfish, funny and )Tj
T*(driven. It's the best work she has done to date."[27] Keaton received her )Tj
T*(second Academy Award nomination for the film. )Tj
T*( Beatty cast Keaton after seeing her in Annie Hall, as he wanted to bring her )Tj
T*(natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role. The production of Reds )Tj
T*(was delayed several times since its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left )Tj
T*(the project when she believed it would never be produced. Filming finally began )Tj
T*(two years later. In a 2006 Vanity Fair story, Keaton described her role as "the )Tj
T*(everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was )Tj
T*(probably more ordinary ... I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure." )Tj
T*(Assistant director Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of her )Tj
T*(most difficult roles, and that "[she] almost got broken."[28] )Tj
T*( 1984 brought The Little Drummer Girl, Keaton's first excursion into the )Tj
T*(thriller and action genre. The Little Drummer Girl was both a financial and )Tj
T*(critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, )Tj
T*(such as one review from The New Republic claiming that "the title role, the )Tj
T*(pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses )Tj
T*(in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate."[29] However, that same year )Tj
T*(she received positive reviews for her performance in Mrs. Soffel, a film based )Tj
T*(on the true story of a repressed prison warden's wife who falls in love with a )Tj
T*(convicted murderer and arranges for his escape. Two years later she starred )Tj
T*(with Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek in Crimes of the Heart, adapted from Beth )Tj
T*(Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen )Tj
T*(comedy. She starred in her first commercial vehicle with 1987's Baby Boom, her )Tj
T*(first of four collaborations with writer-producer Nancy Meyers. In Baby Boom, )Tj
T*(Keaton starred as a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced to care for a )Tj
T*(toddler. That same year she made a cameo in Allen's film Radio Days as a )Tj
T*(nightclub singer. 1988's The Good Mother was a misstep for Keaton. The film was )Tj
T*(a financial disappointment \(according to Keaton, the film was "a Big Failure. )Tj
T*(Like, BIG failure"\),[30] and some critics panned her performance, such was one )Tj
T*(review from The Washington Post: "her acting degenerates into hype¬†‚Äì as if )Tj
T*(she's trying to sell an idea she can't fully believe in."[31] )Tj
T*( In 1987, Keaton directed and edited her first feature film, a documentary )Tj
T*(named Heaven about the possibility of an afterlife. Heaven met with mixed )Tj
T*(critical reaction, with The New York Times likening it to "a conceit imposed on )Tj
T*(its subjects."[32] Over the next four years, Keaton went on to direct music )Tj
T*(videos for artists such as Belinda Carlisle, two television films starring )Tj
T*(Patricia Arquette, and episodes of the series China Beach and Twin Peaks. )Tj

T*(roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role )Tj
T*(choices and avoidance of becoming typecast, she said: "Most often a particular )Tj

T*(similar roles ... I have tried to break away from the usual roles and have )Tj
T*(tried my hand at several things."[33] )Tj
T*( She began the decade with The Lemon Sisters, a poorly received comedy/drama )Tj
T*(that she starred in and produced, which was shelved for a year after its )Tj
T*(completion. In 1991, Keaton starred with Steve Martin in the family comedy )Tj
T*(Father of the Bride. She was almost not cast in the film, as the commercial )Tj
T*(failure of The Good Mother had strained her relationship with Walt Disney )Tj
T*(Pictures, the studio of both films.[30]Father of the Bride was Keaton's first )Tj
T*(major hit after four years of commercial disappointments. )Tj
T*( Keaton reprised her role four years later in the sequel, as a woman who )Tj
T*(becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. A review of )Tj
T*(the film for The San Francisco Examiner was one of many in which Keaton once )Tj
T*(again received comparison to Katharine Hepburn: "No longer relying on that )Tj
T*(stuttering uncertainty that seeped into all her characterizations of the 1970s, )Tj
T*(she has somehow become Katharine Hepburn with a deep maternal instinct, that )Tj
T*(is, she is a fine and intelligent actress who doesn't need to be tough and edgy )Tj
T*(in order to prove her feminism."[34] )Tj
T*( Keaton reprised her role of Kay Adams in 1990's The Godfather Part III. Set 20 )Tj
T*(years after the end of The Godfather, Part II, Keaton's part had evolved into )Tj
T*(the estranged ex-wife of Michael Corleone. Criticism of the film and Keaton )Tj
T*(again centered on her character's unimportance in the film. The Washington Post )Tj
T*(wrote: "Even though she is authoritative in the role, Keaton suffers )Tj
T*(tremendously from having no real function except to nag Michael for his past )Tj
T*(sins."[35] In 1993, Keaton starred in Manhattan Murder Mystery, her first film )Tj
T*(with Woody Allen since 1979. Her part was originally intended for Mia Farrow, )Tj
T*(but Farrow dropped out of the project after her split with Allen.[36] )Tj
T*( In 1995, Keaton directed Unstrung Heroes, her first theatrically released )Tj
T*(narrative film. The movie, adapted from Franz Lidz's memoir, starred Nathan )Tj
T*(Watt as a boy in 1960s whose mother \(Andie MacDowell\) becomes ill with cancer. )Tj
T*(As her sickness advances and his inventor father \(John Turturro\) grows )Tj
T*(increasingly distant, the boy is sent to live with his two eccentric uncles )Tj
T*(\(Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards\). In a geographic switch, Keaton shifted )Tj
T*(the story's setting from the New York of Lidz's book to the Southern California )Tj
T*(of her own childhood. Though it played in a relatively limited release and made )Tj
T*(little impression at the box office, the film and its direction were )Tj
T*(well-received critically.[37] )Tj
T*( Keaton's most successful film of the decade was the 1996 comedy The First )Tj
T*(Wives Club. She starred with Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler as a trio of "first )Tj
T*(wives": middle-aged women who had been divorced by their husbands in favor of )Tj
T*(younger women. Keaton claimed that making the film "saved [her] life."[38] The )Tj
T*(film was a major success, grossing US$105¬†million at the North American box )Tj
T*(office,[39] and it developed a cult following among middle-aged women.[40] )Tj
T*(Reviews of the film were generally positive for Keaton and her co-stars, and )Tj
T*(she was even referred to by The San Francisco Chronicle as "probably [one of] )Tj
T*(the best comic film actresses alive."[41] In 1997, Keaton, along Hawn and )Tj
T*(Midler, was a recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award, which honors )Tj
T*("outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their )Tj

T*(Although critically acclaimed, the film was not released on a wide scale, )Tj
T*(possibly costing Keaton the Oscar. Keaton said that the biggest challenge of )Tj
T*(the role was understanding the mentality of a person with terminal illness.[5] )Tj
T*( In 1999 Keaton narrated the one-hour public-radio documentary, "If I Get Out )Tj
T*(Alive," the first to focus on the conditions and brutality faced by young )Tj

T*(Creative Media, aired on public radio stations across the country, and was )Tj
T*(honored with a First Place National Headliner Award and a Casey Medal for )Tj

T*(would never direct herself in a film, saying "as a director, you automatically )Tj
T*(have different goals. I can't think about directing when I'm acting."[30] The )Tj
T*(film was a drama about three sisters coping with the senility and eventual )Tj
T*(death of their elderly father, played by Walter Matthau. Hanging Up rated )Tj
T*(poorly with critics and grossed a modest US$36¬†million at the North American )Tj
T*(box office.[45] )Tj
T*( In 2001, Keaton co-starred with Warren Beatty in Town &amp; Country, a )Tj

T*(Country was "less deserving of a review than it is an obituary....The corpse )Tj
T*(took with it the reputations of its starry cast, including Warren Beatty and )Tj
T*(Diane Keaton."[47] Also in 2001, and 2002, Keaton starred in four low-budget )Tj
T*(television films. She played a fanatical nun in the religious drama Sister Mary )Tj
T*(Explains It All, an impoverished mother in the drama On Thin Ice, and a )Tj
T*(bookkeeper in the mob comedy Plan B. In Crossed Over, she played Beverly Lowry, )Tj
T*(a woman who forms an unusual friendship with the only woman executed while on )Tj
T*(death row in Texas, Karla Faye Tucker. )Tj
T*( Keaton's first major hit since 1996 came in 2003's Something's Gotta Give, )Tj
T*(directed by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, )Tj
T*(aged 66 and 57 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a )Tj
T*(romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly )Tj
T*(declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to )Tj
T*(be bankable. Keaton commented about the situation in Ladies' Home Journal: )Tj
T*("Let's face it, people my age and Jack's age are much deeper, much more )Tj
T*(soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They have a great deal of passion )Tj
T*(and hope‚Äîwhy shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?"[48] )Tj

T*(Gabriel Macht, the project opened to overwhelmingly negative reviews by )Tj
T*(critics, with Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe calling it "a sloppily made )Tj
T*(bowl of reheated chick-flick cliches," and was ranked among the worst-reviewed )Tj
T*(films of the year.[57][58][59] The following year, Keaton received her first )Tj
T*(and only Golden Raspberry Award nomination to date.[54] In Mama's Boy, director )Tj
T*(Tim Hamilton's feature film debut, Keaton starred as the mother of a )Tj
T*(self-absorbed 29-year old \(played by Jon Heder\) whose world turns upside down )Tj
T*(when his widowed mother starts dating and considers booting him out of the )Tj
T*(house. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States )Tj
T*(only, the independent comedy garnered largely negative reviews.[60] )Tj
T*( In 2008, Keaton starred alongside Dax Shepard and Liv Tyler in Vince Di )Tj
T*(Meglio's dramedy Smother, playing the overbearing mother of an unemployed )Tj
T*(therapist, who decides to move in with him and his girlfriend following the )Tj
T*(split from her husband, played by Ken Howard. As with Mama's Boy, the film )Tj
T*(received a limited release only, resulting into minor gross of US$1.8¬†million )Tj
T*(worldwide.[61] Critical reaction to the film was generally unfavorable,[62] and )Tj
T*(once again Keaton was dismissed for her role choices, with Sandra Hall of the )Tj
T*(New York Post writing, "Diane's career is dyin' [...] this time, sadly, she's )Tj
T*(gone too far. She's turned herself into a mother-in-law joke."[63] Also in )Tj
T*(2008, Keaton appeared alongside Katie Holmes and Queen Latifah in the )Tj
T*(crime-comedy film Mad Money, directed by Callie Khouri. Based on the British )Tj
T*(television drama Hot Money \(2001\), the film revolves around three female )Tj
T*(employees of the Federal Reserve who scheme to steal money that is about to be )Tj
T*(destroyed.[64] As with Keaton's previous projects, the film bombed at the box )Tj
T*(offices with a gross total of US$26.4¬†million,[65] and was universally panned )Tj
T*(by critics, ranking third in the New York Post's Top 10 Worst Movies of 2008 )Tj
T*(overview.[66] )Tj
T*( In 2010, Keaton starred alongside Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford in Roger )Tj
T*(Michell's comedy Morning Glory, playing the veteran TV host of a fictional )Tj
T*(morning talk show that desperately needs to boost its lagging ratings. )Tj
T*(Portraying a narcissistic character that would do anything to please the )Tj
T*(audience, Keaton described her role as "the kind of woman you love to )Tj
T*(hate."[67] Inspired by Neil Simon's 1972 Broadway play The Sunshine Boys,[68] )Tj
T*(the film became a moderate success at the box office for a worldwide total of )Tj
T*(almost US$59 million.[69] Though some critics found that Keaton was underused )Tj
T*(in the film,[70] the actress was generally praised for her performance, with )Tj
T*(James Berardinelli of ReelViews noting that "Diane Keaton is so good at her )Tj
T*(part that one can see her sliding effortlessly into an anchor's chair on a real )Tj
T*(morning show."[71] )Tj
T*( In fall 2010, Keaton joined the production of the comedy drama Darling )Tj
T*(Companion by Lawrence Kasdan, which was released in 2012. Co-starring Kevin )Tj
T*(Kline and Dianne Wiest and set in Telluride, Colorado,[72] the film follows a )Tj
T*(woman, played by Keaton, whose husband loses her much-beloved dog at a wedding )Tj
T*(held at their vacation home in the Rocky Mountains, resulting in a search party )Tj
T*(to find the pet.[73] Kasdan's first film in nine years, the film bombed at the )Tj
T*(US box office, where it scored about US$790,000 throughout its entire )Tj
T*(theatrical run.[74] Generally negative with the film, critics dismissed the )Tj
T*(film as "an overwritten, underplotted vanity project," but applauded Keaton's )Tj
T*(performance.[75][76] Ty Burr from The Boston Globe felt that the film "would be )Tj
T*(instantly forgettable if not for Keaton, who imbues [her role] with a sorrow, )Tj
T*(warmth, wisdom, and rage that feel earned [...] Her performance here is an )Tj
T*(extension of worn, resilient grace."[76] )Tj
T*( Also in 2011, Keaton began production on Justin Zackham's ensemble comedy The )Tj
T*(Big Wedding, in which she, along with Robert De Niro, will play a long-divorced )Tj
T*(couple who, for the sake of their adopted son's wedding and his very religious )Tj
T*(biological mother, pretend they're still married.[77] In addition, Keaton has )Tj
T*(been cast in the family comedy One Big Happy alongside Steve Martin,[78]The )Tj
T*(Look of Love, an independent romance film, with Ed Harris,[79] and the romantic )Tj
T*(comedy And So It Goes..., a collaboration with Michael Douglas and director P. )Tj

T*( [edit] Personal life )Tj
T*( [edit] Relationships and family )Tj
T*( Keaton had bulimia during the early 1970s.[81] Her most famous romance was )Tj
T*(with director Woody Allen. Keaton and Allen first met during her audition for )Tj
T*(the Broadway production of Play It Again, Sam, but they did not know each other )Tj
T*(personally until having dinner after a late night rehearsal. Allen claims that )Tj
T*(Keaton's sense of humor attracted him to her.[82] They briefly lived together )Tj
T*(during the Broadway run of Play It Again, Sam, but their relationship became )Tj
T*(less formal by the time the film version was produced in 1972.[83] They worked )Tj
T*(together on eight films between 1971 and 1993. )Tj
T*( In 1979, she began dating her Reds co-star Warren Beatty.[84] Keaton's )Tj
T*(involvement with Beatty also made her a regular subject of tabloid magazines )Tj
T*(and media at the time, a role she was unaccustomed to. \(As a result of her )Tj
T*(avoiding the spotlight, Vanity Fair described her in 1985 as "the most )Tj
T*(reclusive star since Garbo".\)[8] Beatty and Keaton separated shortly after )Tj
T*(completing Reds. Their separation was believed to have been caused by the )Tj
T*(strain of making the film, a troubled production with numerous financial and )Tj
T*(scheduling problems.[28] Keaton still maintains contact with both Allen and )Tj
T*(Beatty, and describes Allen as one of her closest friends.[17] )Tj
T*( Keaton also had a relationship with Al Pacino, her co-star in The Godfather )Tj
T*(Trilogy. The on-again, off-again relationship ended following the filming of )Tj
T*(The Godfather Part III. Referring to the relationship, Keaton has said "Al was )Tj
T*(simply the most entertaining man... To me, that's, that is the most beautiful )Tj
T*(face. I think Warren was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. )Tj
T*(Killer, killer face."[85] Pacino, who seems to have been the love of Keaton's )Tj
T*(life, never agreed to her marriage ultimatums, and their lengthy relationship )Tj
T*(ended when her father was dying of brain cancer.[84] )Tj
T*( In July 2001, Keaton publicly announced that she had given up pursuing )Tj
T*(romance, and stated, "I don't think that because I'm not married it's made my )Tj
T*(life any less. That old maid myth is garbage."[86] Keaton has two adopted )Tj
T*(children, daughter Dexter \(adopted 1996\) and son Duke \(2001\). Keaton decided to )Tj
T*(become a mother at the age of 50 after the death of her father, when she began )Tj
T*(to realize her own mortality.[38] She later said of having children, )Tj
T*("Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about the most completely )Tj
T*(humbling experience that I've ever had."[87] )Tj
T*( [edit] Religious beliefs )Tj
T*( Keaton stated that she produced her 1987 documentary Heaven because, "I was )Tj
T*(always pretty religious as a kid ... I was primarily interested in religion )Tj
T*(because I wanted to go to heaven" but also stated that she considered herself )Tj
T*(an agnostic.[88] )Tj
T*( Raised a Methodist, Keaton stated in an October 2002 television interview with )Tj
T*(Oxygen that although she currently believes in God, she considered herself an )Tj
T*(atheist for a period of her life. )Tj
T*( [edit] Other activities )Tj
T*( Keaton is an opponent of plastic surgery. She told More magazine in 2004, "I'm )Tj
T*(stuck in this idea that I need to be authentic ... My face needs to look the )Tj
T*(way I feel."[6] Keaton is also active in campaigns with the Los Angeles )Tj
T*(Conservancy to save and restore historic buildings, particularly in the Los )Tj
T*(Angeles area.[9] Among the buildings she has been active in restoring is the )Tj
T*(Ennis House in the Hollywood Hills designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.[23] Keaton )Tj
T*(had also been active in the failed campaign to save the Ambassador Hotel in Los )Tj
T*(Angeles \(a hotel featured in Reservations\), the location of Robert Kennedy's )Tj
T*(assassination in 1968. )Tj
T*( Since May 2005, she has been a contributing blogger at The Huffington Post. )Tj
T*(Since summer 2006, Keaton has been the new face of L'Or√©al.[89] )Tj
T*( Keaton has served as a producer on films and television series. She produced )Tj
T*(the Fox series Pasadena, that was canceled after airing only four episodes in )Tj
T*(2001 but later completed its run on cable in 2005. In 2003, she produced the )Tj
T*(Gus Van Sant drama Elephant, about a school shooting. On why she produced the )Tj
T*(film, she said "It really makes me think about my responsibilities as an adult )Tj

T*(to try and understand what's going on with young people."[90] )Tj
T*( Outside of the film industry, Keaton has continued to pursue her interest in )Tj
T*(photography. As a collector, she told Vanity Fair in 1987: "I have amassed a )Tj
T*(huge library of images¬†‚Äì kissing scenes from movies, pictures I like. Visual )Tj
T*(things are really key for me."[88] She has published several more collections )Tj
T*(of her own photographs, and has also served as an editor for collections of )Tj
T*(vintage photography. Works she has edited in the last decade include a book of )Tj
T*(photographs by paparazzo Ron Galella; an anthology of reproductions of clown )Tj
T*(paintings; and a collection of photos of California's Spanish-Colonial-style )Tj
T*(houses. )Tj
T*( Keaton has also established herself as a real estate developer. She has resold )Tj
T*(several mansions in Southern California after renovating and redesigning them. )Tj
T*(One of her clients is Madonna, who purchased a US$6.5¬†million Beverly Hills )Tj
T*(mansion from Keaton in 2003.[91] She received the Film Society of Lincoln )Tj
T*(Center's Gala Tribute in 2007. )Tj
T*( Keaton wrote her first memoir, entitled Then Again, for Random House in )Tj
T*(November 2011.[92] Much of the autobiography relies on her mother Dorothy's )Tj
T*(private journals, in which she writes at one point: "Diane...is a mystery...At )Tj
T*(times, she's so basic, at others so wise it frightens me."[93] )Tj

T*(statement, the museum aims to enable "individuals to undertake serious study )Tj
T*(into the field of phallology in an organized, scientific fashion."[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( The museum's founder Sigur√∞ur Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for )Tj
T*(37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjav√≠k's Hamrahl√≠d College before )Tj
T*(his retirement.[5] As a child, he owned a bull's penis \(or pizzle\) which was )Tj
T*(given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a )Tj
T*(friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, )Tj
T*(three of which Sigur√∞ur gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations )Tj
T*(began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, )Tj
T*(expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around )Tj
T*(Iceland.[6] )Tj
T*( The organs of farm animals came from abattoirs, while fishermen supplied those )Tj
T*(of seals and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from )Tj
T*(commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the )Tj
T*(International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling )Tj
T*(in 1986. Sigur√∞ur was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting )Tj
T*(them from the 12‚Äì16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast )Tj
T*(each year.[6] He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who )Tj
T*(found the animal drifting on pack ice off the Westfjords.[2] He was assisted by )Tj
T*(his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter )Tj
T*(√ûorger√∞ur recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a )Tj
T*(specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: "Someone )Tj
T*(asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat )Tj
T*(penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'"[7] According )Tj
T*(to Sigur√∞ur, "Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never )Tj
T*(stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one."[8] )Tj
T*( The collection was at first housed in Sigur√∞ur's office at the college until )Tj
T*(he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to )Tj
T*(put it on public display in Reykjav√≠k and was awarded a grant from the city )Tj
T*(council of ISK 200,000 to support the opening of a museum in August 1997.[9] By )Tj
T*(2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. )Tj
T*(He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered it to the city of )Tj
T*(Reykjav√≠k as a gift.[10] However, he was unsuccessful in obtaining financial )Tj
T*(support from the state or city. When he retired in 2004, he could no longer )Tj
T*(afford the rent on the museum's premises.[11] )Tj
T*( After his retirement, he moved along with his collection to H√∫sav√≠k, a fishing )Tj
T*(village with a population of about 2,200 people located 298 miles \(480¬†km\) )Tj
T*(northeast of the capital. The museum was housed in a small building, formerly a )Tj
T*(restaurant,[11] that was marked with a giant wooden penis and a stone phallus )Tj
T*(standing outside on the street. The village's inhabitants were at first )Tj
T*(skeptical of the new arrival, but came to accept it when they were persuaded )Tj
T*(that there was nothing pornographic about the museum.[2] )Tj
T*( In 2012 he handed over the collection to his son, Hj√∂rtur G√≠sli Sigur√∞sson )Tj
T*(\(described by Slate as "the world's only hereditary penis-museum operator"[7]\). )Tj
T*(It was relocated from H√∫sav√≠k to Reykjav√≠k's main shopping street at Laugavegur )Tj
T*(116.[12] An offer from a wealthy German to buy the museum for ISK 30 million )Tj
T*(\(US $232,000 / ‚Ç¨186,000\) and a proposal to move it to the United Kingdom were )Tj
T*(both turned down, as Hj√∂rtur insists that "the museum has to be in )Tj
T*(Iceland."[13] He intends to continue acquiring new penises because you can )Tj
T*("always get a better, newer one¬†... a bigger size or better shape, you )Tj
T*(know?"[14] )Tj
T*( Sigur√∞ur has described the collection as the product of "37 years of )Tj
T*(collecting penises. Somebody had to do it."[8] According to University of )Tj
T*(Iceland anthropologist Sigurj√≥n Baldur Hafsteinsson, Icelanders' tolerance of )Tj
T*(the museum is an indicator of how Icelandic society has changed since the )Tj
T*(1990s, when a newly elected neoliberal government fostered a more open outlook )Tj
T*(on entertainment, creativity and tourism that has "enabled new ideas to emerge )Tj
T*(publicly".[8] He has documented the significance of the museum's role in )Tj
T*(Icelandic culture in a forthcoming book, Icelandick: The Phallological Museum )Tj

T*( [edit] Collection )Tj
T*( According to the museum's website, the collection comprises 280 specimens from )Tj
T*(93 species of animals. They range from some of the largest to some of the )Tj
T*(smallest penises in the animal world. Its largest exhibit is a portion of a )Tj
T*(blue whale's penis measuring 170¬†cm \(67¬†in\) long and weighing 70 kilograms \(150¬†)Tj
T*(lb\),[3] which Iceland Review has dubbed "a real Moby Dick".[16] The specimen is )Tj
T*(only the front tip as the entire organ, when intact, would have been about 5¬†m )Tj
T*(\(16¬†ft\) long and weighed about 350‚Äì450 kilograms \(770‚Äì990¬†lb\). The penis bone )Tj
T*(of a hamster, only 2¬†mm \(0.08¬†in\) long, is the smallest item in the collection )Tj
T*(and needs a magnifying glass to view it.[3] )Tj
T*( The museum also has a "folklore section" exhibiting mythological penises; its )Tj
T*(online catalogue lists specimens taken from elves, trolls, kelpies, and "The )Tj
T*(Nasty Ghost of Sn√¶fell".[17] Sigur√∞ur says that the elf's penis, which the )Tj
T*(museum's catalogue describes as "unusally big and old", is among his )Tj
T*(favourites. It cannot be seen, as Icelandic folklore holds that elves and )Tj
T*(trolls are invisible.[11] The folkloric penises also include those of a merman, )Tj
T*(a one-legged, one-armed and one-eyed monster called a Beach-Murmurer, an )Tj
T*(Enriching Beach Mouse \(said to draw "money from the sea to enrich her owner"\), )Tj
T*(and an Icelandic Christmas Lad found dead at the foot of a mountain in 1985 and )Tj
T*(whose penis was presented to the museum by a former mayor of Reykjav√≠k.[17] )Tj
T*( The museum's website states that it enables "individuals to undertake serious )Tj
T*(study into the field of phallology in an organized, scientific fashion", giving )Tj
T*(due prominence to a field that until now has only been "a borderline field of )Tj
T*(study in other academic disciplines such as history, art, psychology, )Tj
T*(literature and other artistic fields like music and ballet."[17] The museum )Tj
T*(aims to collect penis specimens from every mammal in Iceland. It also exhibits )Tj
T*(phallic artwork and penis-related objects or "phallobilia" such as lampshades )Tj
T*(made from the scrotums of bulls.[4] Other exhibits range "from an 18th-century )Tj
T*(engraving depicting the circumcision of Christ to a 20th-century plastic penis )Tj
T*(pacifier."[16] Most of the collection has been donated, and the only purchase )Tj
T*(to date has been an elephant's penis measuring nearly 1¬†m \(3.3¬†ft\) long. The )Tj
T*(penises are either preserved in formaldehyde and displayed in jars or are dried )Tj
T*(and hung or mounted on the walls of the museum.[3] )Tj
T*( Sigur√∞ur has used a variety of techniques to preserve the penises, including )Tj
T*(preservation in formaldehyde, pickling, drying, stuffing and salting.[18] One )Tj
T*(particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a walking )Tj
T*(stick.[8] Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by )Tj
T*(Sigur√∞ur from rams' testicles.[18] Sigur√∞ur has also carved wooden phalluses, )Tj
T*(which can be found adorning various objects around the museum,[2] and has a bow )Tj
T*(tie decorated with images of phalluses that he wears on special occasions.[11] )Tj
T*( Josh Schonwald of Salon.com described his impressions of the museum when he )Tj
T*(visited in 1998: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(They were hanging on the walls, stuffed in jars, displayed with curatorial love¬†)Tj
T*(‚Äì dried penises, penises embalmed in formaldehyde, massive penises displayed )Tj
T*(like hunting trophies. A tanned bull's penis, a smoked horse's penis. There )Tj
T*(were runty, shriveled penises of reindeer, foxes, minks and rats. There were )Tj
T*(seal and walrus penises with stiff penis bones¬†‚Äì ensuring a perpetually erect )Tj
T*(state. There was the Big Penis¬†‚Äì a 3-foot-long blue whale penis \(which could )Tj
T*(have been an oar for a canoe\).[6])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The museum is open every day[19] and by July 2011 was attracting up to 11,000 )Tj
T*(visitors annually.[2] Sixty percent of the museum's visitors are reported to be )Tj
T*(women,[3] though according to the authors of the Rough Guide to Iceland, )Tj

T*( [edit] Human penis )Tj
T*( For many years, the museum sought to obtain a human penis. Sigur√∞ur was able )Tj
T*(to obtain human testicles and a foreskin from two separate donors;[22] the )Tj
T*(foreskin was donated by Iceland's National Hospital after an emergency )Tj
T*(circumcision operation.[20] The museum also contains sculptures of 15 penises )Tj
T*(based on the Iceland national handball team. As the team had won the silver )Tj
T*(medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the penises were made from a silvered )Tj
T*(material. Sigur√∞ur claims that although they are not displayed in the same )Tj
T*(order as the individuals shown in the photograph that accompanies them, "their )Tj
T*(wives would recognise them."[2] According to Slate, these sculptures were )Tj
T*(created by Sigur√∞ur's daughter, √ûorger√∞ur Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir, and were based on her )Tj
T*(own experience rather than any knowledge of the team. The team's goalkeeper )Tj
T*(denies that the sculptures are casts.[7] )Tj
T*( The museum has so far received pledges from four men‚Äîan Icelander, a German, )Tj
T*(an American and a Briton‚Äîto donate their penises. Canadian film-maker Zach Math )Tj
T*(comments that the American "is an ordinary guy but he has this quirk where he )Tj
T*(thinks of his penis as a separate entity from his body¬†‚Äî Elmo. He has this )Tj
T*(dream that he wants it to be the most famous penis in the world."[23] According )Tj
T*(to Sigur√∞ur, the American donor "wanted to have his penis cut off even during )Tj
T*(his lifetime and then visit the museum."[11] The American sent a cast of his )Tj
T*(penis to serve as a substitute in the meantime,[3] along with photographs of it )Tj
T*(dressed up as Santa Claus and Abraham Lincoln.[24] The donor also tattooed his )Tj
T*(penis with the Stars and Stripes to make it more attractive.[23] )Tj
T*( The Icelandic donor was a 95-year-old man from nearby Akureyri who was said to )Tj
T*(have been a womaniser in his youth and wanted to donate his penis to the museum )Tj
T*(to ensure his "eternal fame".[3] Sigur√∞ur said that, even at the age of 95, the )Tj
T*(donor remained active, "both vertically and horizontally".[6] However, the )Tj
T*(donor was said to be concerned that "his penis is shrinking as he gets older )Tj
T*(and he is worried it might not make a proper exhibit."[3] His penis was given )Tj
T*(priority over those of the non-Icelandic donors in accordance with the museum's )Tj
T*(mission to display the organs of Icelandic mammals. Removing and preserving it )Tj
T*(was not an easy proposition, as Sigur√∞ur explained: "The donor and the doctors )Tj
T*(are in agreement, it must be taken while the body is warm. Then bleed it and )Tj
T*(pump it up. If it cools you can't do anything, so [the donor] is eager to have )Tj
T*(it taken warm and treated to be preserved with dignity."[18] )Tj
T*( In January 2011, the Icelandic donor died and his penis was surgically removed )Tj
T*(so that it could be added to the museum's collection. The penectomy was not )Tj
T*(entirely successful and left the penis "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". )Tj
T*(According to Sigur√∞ur, "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to )Tj
T*(keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it "went directly into the )Tj
T*(formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigur√∞ur expressed )Tj
T*(confidence that "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon."[2] )Tj
T*(Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is "that it's very )Tj
T*(old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [sic] say 'oh, I hope mine )Tj
T*(will not look like this when I get old.'"[14] Sigur√∞ur has considered donating )Tj
T*(his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: )Tj
T*("If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't )Tj
T*(say. She might say no."[2] )Tj
T*( The museum is the subject of The Final Member, a film by Canadian )Tj
T*(documentarians Zach Math and Jonah Bekhor. It profiles Sigur√∞ur and his quest )Tj
T*(to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling the story of the American and )Tj
T*(Icelandic donors and examining the quasi-taboo nature of the museum's )Tj
T*(collection. Bekhor says: "I wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending )Tj
T*(on how you react to it really says a lot about what your relationship is with )Tj
T*(that element of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and )Tj
T*(we're really curious to see how audiences respond." The film premiered on 1 May )Tj
T*(2012 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.[25] )Tj

T*( "We Are the World" is a song and charity single originally recorded by the )Tj
T*(supergroup USA for Africa in 1985. It was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel )Tj
T*(Richie, and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian for the album We Are )Tj
T*(the World. With sales in excess of 20 million copies, it is one of the fewer )Tj
T*(than 30 all-time singles to have sold 10 million \(or more\) copies worldwide. )Tj
T*( Following Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" project in the UK, an idea )Tj
T*(for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came )Tj
T*(from activist Harry Belafonte, who, along with fundraiser Ken Kragen, was )Tj
T*(instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were )Tj
T*(contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Richie were assigned the task of )Tj
T*(writing the song. Following several months of working together, the duo )Tj
T*(completed the writing of "We Are the World" one night before the song's first )Tj
T*(recording session, in early 1985. The last recording session for the song was )Tj
T*(held on January 28, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most )Tj
T*(famous artists in the music industry at the time. )Tj
T*( The song was released on March 7, 1985, as the only single from the album. A )Tj
T*(worldwide commercial success, it topped music charts throughout the world and )Tj
T*(became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. The first ever )Tj
T*(single to be certified multi-platinum, "We Are the World" received a Quadruple )Tj
T*(Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. )Tj
T*(However, the song garnered mixed reviews from journalists, music critics, and )Tj
T*(the public. Fans enjoyed hearing racially and musically diverse recording )Tj
T*(artists singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying "We Are the )Tj
T*(World", knowing that the money was going to charity. Other individuals, )Tj
T*(including many commentators in the rock press, were disappointed that the song )Tj
T*(did not challenge listeners as to why famines occur in the first place, and )Tj
T*(felt that the lyrics were self-aggrandizing. )Tj

T*(aided survivors in the impoverished country. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background and writing )Tj
T*( Before the writing of "We Are the World", American entertainer and social )Tj
T*(activist Harry Belafonte had sought for some time to have a song recorded by )Tj
T*(the most famous artists in the music industry at the time. He planned to have )Tj
T*(the proceeds donated to a new organization called United Support of Artists for )Tj
T*(Africa \(USA for Africa\). The non-profit foundation would then feed and relieve )Tj
T*(starving people in Africa, specifically Ethiopia, where around one million )Tj
T*(people died during the country's 1984‚Äì1985 famine.[1][2] The idea followed Band )Tj
T*(Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas" project in the UK, which Belafonte had )Tj
T*(heard about.[nb 1][4] In the activist's plans, money would also be set aside to )Tj
T*(help eliminate hunger in the United States of America. Entertainment manager )Tj
T*(and fellow fundraiser Ken Kragen was contacted by Belafonte, who asked for )Tj
T*(singers Lionel Richie and Kenny Rogers‚ÄîKragen's clients‚Äîto participate in )Tj
T*(Belafonte's musical endeavor. Kragen and the two musicians agreed to help with )Tj
T*(Belafonte's mission, and in turn, enlisted the cooperation of Stevie Wonder, to )Tj
T*(add more "name value" to their project.[1]Quincy Jones was drafted to )Tj
T*(co-produce the song, taking time out from his work on The Color Purple.[1][5] )Tj
T*(Richie also telephoned Michael Jackson, who had just released the commercially )Tj
T*(successful Thriller album and had concluded a tour with his brothers.[1] )Tj
T*( Jackson revealed to Richie that he not only wanted to sing the song, but to )Tj
T*(participate in its writing as well.[1][6] To begin with, "We Are the World" was )Tj
T*(to be written by Jackson, Richie, and Wonder. As Wonder had limited time to )Tj
T*(work on the project, Jackson and Richie proceeded to write "We Are the World" )Tj
T*(themselves.[6] They began creating the song at Hayvenhurst, the Jackson family )Tj
T*(home in Encino. For a week, the two spent every night working on lyrics and )Tj
T*(melodies in the singer's bedroom. They knew that they wanted a song that would )Tj
T*(be easy to sing and memorable. The pair wanted to create an anthem. Jackson's )Tj
T*(older sister La¬†Toya watched the two work on the song, and later contended that )Tj
T*(Richie only wrote a few lines for the track.[5] She stated that her younger )Tj
T*(brother wrote 99¬†percent of the lyrics, "but he's never felt it necessary to )Tj
T*(say that".[5] La¬†Toya further commented on the song's creation in an interview )Tj
T*(with the American celebrity news magazine People. "I'd go into the room while )Tj
T*(they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael's )Tj
T*(usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them."[6] )Tj
T*( Richie had recorded two melodies for "We Are the World", which Jackson took, )Tj
T*(adding music and words to the song in the same day. Jackson stated, "I love )Tj
T*(working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing, I couldn't wait. I )Tj
T*(went in and came out the same night with the song completed‚Äîdrums, piano, )Tj
T*(strings, and words to the chorus."[7] Jackson then presented his demo to Richie )Tj
T*(and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see the )Tj
T*(structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie )Tj
T*(were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work )Tj
T*(done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson )Tj
T*(completed the lyrics and melody of "We Are the World" within two and a half )Tj
T*(hours, one night before the song's first recording session.[7] )Tj

T*(California, was filled with musicians, technicians, video crews, retinues, )Tj
T*(assistants, and organizers as the four musicians entered. To begin the night, a )Tj
T*("vocal guide" of "We Are the World" was recorded by Richie and Jackson and )Tj
T*(duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers. The guide was recorded )Tj
T*(on the sixth take, as Quincy Jones felt that there was too much "thought" in )Tj
T*(the previous versions.[8] )Tj
T*( Following their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began thinking of )Tj
T*(alternatives for the line "There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own )Tj
T*(lives": the pair was concerned that the latter part of the line would be )Tj
T*(considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the )Tj
T*(chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to )Tj
T*("We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. )Tj
T*(Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. "One thing )Tj
T*(we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting )Tj
T*(ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a choice we're making.'"[9] )Tj
T*(Around 1:30¬†am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of )Tj
T*(melodic vocalizations, including the sound "sha-lum sha-lin-gay".[9] Jones told )Tj
T*(the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape. "If we get too )Tj
T*(good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio," he announced.[9] )Tj
T*( On January 24, 1985, after a day of rest, Jones shipped Richie and Jackson's )Tj
T*(vocal guide to all of the artists who would be involved in "We Are the World"'s )Tj
T*(recording. Enclosed in the package was a letter from Jones, addressed to "My )Tj
T*(Fellow Artists":[9] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The cassettes are numbered, and I can't express how important it is not to let )Tj
T*(this material out of your hands. Please do not make copies, and return this )Tj
T*(cassette the night of the 28th. In the years to come, when your children ask, )Tj
T*('What did mommy and daddy do for the war against world famine?', you can say )Tj
T*(proudly, this was your contribution.[9])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Ken Kragen chaired a production meeting at a bungalow off Sunset Boulevard on )Tj
T*(January 25, 1985. There, Kragen and his team discussed where the recording )Tj
T*(sessions with the supergroup of musicians should take place. He stated, "The )Tj
T*(single most damaging piece of information is where we're doing this. If that )Tj
T*(shows up anywhere, we've got a chaotic situation that could totally destroy the )Tj
T*(project. The moment a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a Bob Dylan‚ÄîI guarantee )Tj
T*(you!‚Äîdrives up and sees a mob around that studio, he will never come in."[9] On )Tj
T*(the same night, Quincy Jones' associate producer and vocal arranger, Tom )Tj
T*(Bahler, was given the task of matching each solo line with the right voice. )Tj
T*(Bahler stated, "It's like vocal arranging in a perfect world."[9] Jones )Tj
T*(disagreed, stating that the task was like "putting a watermelon in a Coke )Tj
T*(bottle".[9] The following evening, Lionel Richie held a "choreography" session )Tj
T*(at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.[9] )Tj
T*( The final night of recording was held on January 28, 1985, at A&amp;M )Tj
T*(Recording Studios in Hollywood.[3][9] Michael Jackson arrived at 9¬†pm, earlier )Tj
T*(than the other artists, to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus by )Tj
T*(himself.[9] He was subsequently joined in the recording studio by the remaining )Tj
T*(USA for Africa artists, which included Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, )Tj
T*(Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen and Smokey Robinson. Also in attendance were )Tj
T*(five of Jackson's siblings: Jackie, La¬†Toya, Marlon, Randy and Tito.[10] Many )Tj
T*(of the participants came straight from an American Music Award ceremony, which )Tj
T*(had been held that same night.[5] Invited musician Prince, who would have had a )Tj
T*(part in which he and Michael Jackson sang to each other, did not attend the )Tj
T*(recording session.[11] The reason given for his absence has varied. One )Tj
T*(newspaper claimed that the singer did not want to record with other acts.[12] )Tj
T*(Another report, from the time of "We Are the World"'s recording, suggested that )Tj
T*(the musician did not want to partake in the session because organizer Bob )Tj
T*(Geldof called him a "creep".[13] Prince did, however, donate an exclusive )Tj
T*(track, "4 The Tears In Your Eyes", for the We Are the World album.[12] In all, )Tj

T*(to sing. Several hours passed before Stevie Wonder announced that he would like )Tj
T*(to substitute the "sha-lum sha-lin-gay" sound for a line in Swahili.[17][18] At )Tj
T*(this point, Waylon Jennings left the recording studio and never returned; he )Tj
T*(allegedly felt that no "good ole boy" ever sang in Swahili.[17][18] A heated )Tj
T*(debate ensued, in which several artists rejected the suggestion. The "sha-lum )Tj
T*(sha-lin-gay" sound ran into opposition as well and was subsequently removed )Tj
T*(from the song. The participants eventually decided to sing something meaningful )Tj
T*(in English. They chose to sing the new line "One world, Our children", which )Tj
T*(most of the participants enjoyed.[17] )Tj
T*( In the early hours of the morning, two Ethiopian women, guests of Stevie )Tj

T*( [edit] Release and reception )Tj
T*( On March 8, 1985, "We Are the World" was released as a single, in both 7" and )Tj
T*(12" format.[24][25] The song was the only one released from the We Are the )Tj
T*(World album and became a chart success around the world. In the US, it was a )Tj
T*(number one hit on the R&amp;B singles chart, the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks )Tj
T*(chart and the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for a month.[26][27] The )Tj
T*(single had initially debuted at number 21 on the Hot 100, the highest entry )Tj
T*(since Michael Jackson's "Thriller" entered the charts at number 20 the year )Tj
T*(before.[22] It took four weeks for the song to claim the number one spot‚Äîhalf )Tj
T*(the time a single would normally have taken to reach its charting peak.[28] On )Tj
T*(the Hot 100, the song moved from 21 to 5 to 2 and then number 1. "We Are the )Tj
T*(World" might have reached the top of the Hot 100 chart sooner, if it were not )Tj
T*(for the success of Phil Collins' "One More Night", which received a significant )Tj
T*(level of support from both pop and rock listeners.[28] "We Are the World" also )Tj
T*(entered Billboard's Top Rock Tracks and Hot Country Singles charts, where it )Tj
T*(peaked at numbers 27 and 76 respectively.[26] The song became the first single )Tj
T*(since The Beatles' "Let It Be" to enter Billboard's Top 5 within two weeks of )Tj
T*(release.[25] Outside of the US, the single reached number one in Australia, )Tj
T*(France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, )Tj
T*(Switzerland and the UK. The song peaked at number 2 in Austria.[29][30][31][32] )Tj
T*( The single was also a commercial success; the initial shipment of 800,000 "We )Tj
T*(Are the World" records sold out within three days of release.[24] The record )Tj
T*(became the fastest-selling American pop single in history.[33] At one Tower )Tj
T*(Records store on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, 1,000¬†copies of the song )Tj
T*(were sold in two days.[34] Store worker Richard Petitpas commented, "A number )Tj
T*(one single sells about 100 to 125¬†copies a week. This is absolutely unheard )Tj
T*(of."[34] By the end of 1985, "We Are the World" had become the best selling )Tj
T*(single of the year.[35] Five years later it was revealed that the song had )Tj
T*(become the biggest single of the 1980s.[36] "We Are the World" was eventually )Tj
T*(cited as the biggest selling single in both US and pop music history.[nb )Tj
T*(2][38][39][40] The song became the first ever single to be certified )Tj
T*(multi-platinum; it received a 4√ó certification by the Recording Industry )Tj
T*(Association of America.[27][41] The estimated global sales of "We Are the )Tj
T*(World" are said to be 20¬†million.[42] )Tj
T*( Following its release, "We Are the World" received mixed reviews from )Tj
T*(journalists, music critics and the public. American journalist Greil Marcus )Tj
T*(felt that the song sounded like a Pepsi jingle.[43] He wrote, "... the constant )Tj
T*(repetition of 'There's a choice we're making' conflates with Pepsi's )Tj
T*(trademarked 'The choice of a new generation' in a way that, on the part of )Tj
T*(Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly )Tj
T*(not intentional, and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity."[43] )Tj
T*(Marcus added, "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less )Tj
T*(about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi‚Äîand the true result will likely be less )Tj
T*(that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than )Tj
T*(they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its )Tj
T*(advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce )Tj
T*(Springsteen, and all the rest."[43] Author Reebee Garofalo agreed, and )Tj

T*(expressed the opinion that the line "We're saving our own lives" was a )Tj
T*("distasteful element of self-indulgence".[43] He asserted that the artists of )Tj
T*(USA for Africa were proclaiming "their own salvation for singing about an issue )Tj
T*(they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never )Tj
T*(encounter".[43] )Tj
T*( In contrast, Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the phrase "There's )Tj
T*(a choice we're making, We're saving our own lives".[3] He commented that the )Tj
T*(line assumed "an extra emotional dimension when sung by people with superstar )Tj
T*(mystiques".[3] Holden expressed that the song was "an artistic triumph that )Tj
T*(transcends its official nature".[3] He noted that unlike Band Aid's "Do They )Tj
T*(Know It's Christmas", the vocals on "We Are the World" were "artfully )Tj
T*(interwoven" and emphasized the individuality of each singer.[3] Holden )Tj
T*(concluded that "We Are the World" was "a simple, eloquent ballad" and a )Tj
T*("fully-realized pop statement that would sound outstanding even if it weren't )Tj
T*(recorded by stars".[3] )Tj
T*( The song proved popular with both young and old listeners.[22] The public )Tj
T*(enjoyed hearing a supergroup of musicians singing together on one track, and )Tj
T*(felt satisfied in buying the record, knowing that the money would go towards a )Tj
T*(good cause.[22] People reported they bought more than one copy of the single, )Tj
T*(some buying up to five copies of the record.[44] One mother from Columbia, )Tj
T*(Missouri purchased two copies of "We Are the World", stating, "The record is )Tj
T*(excellent whether it's for a cause or not. It's fun trying to identify the )Tj
T*(different artists. It was a good feeling knowing that I was helping someone in )Tj
T*(need."[22] )Tj
T*( According to music critic and Bruce Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, "We Are )Tj
T*(the World" was not widely accepted within the rock music community.[45] The )Tj
T*(author revealed that the song was "despised" for what it was not: "a rock )Tj
T*(record, a critique of the political policies that created the famine, a way of )Tj
T*(finding out how and why famines occur, an all-inclusive representation of the )Tj
T*(entire worldwide spectrum of post-Presley popular music".[45] Marsh revealed )Tj
T*(that he felt some of the criticisms were right, while others were silly.[45] He )Tj
T*(claimed that despite the sentimentality of the song, "We Are the World" was a )Tj
T*(large-scale pop event with serious political overtones.[45] )Tj
T*( "We Are the World" was recognized with several awards following its release. )Tj
T*(At the 1986 Grammy Awards, the song and its accompanying music video won four )Tj
T*(awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or )Tj
T*(Group with Vocal and Best Music Video, Short Form.[46] The music video was )Tj
T*(awarded two honors at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards. It collected the awards )Tj
T*(for Best Group Video and Viewer's Choice.[47][48]People's Choice Awards )Tj
T*(recognized "We Are the World" with the Favorite New Song award in 1986.[46] In )Tj
T*(the same year, the American Music Awards named "We Are the World" "Song of the )Tj

T*(Collecting his award, Belafonte thanked Ken Kragen, Quincy Jones, and "the two )Tj
T*(artists who, without their great gift would not have inspired us in quite the )Tj

T*(merchandise sold well; the video cassette‚Äîentitled We Are the World: The Video )Tj

T*(video of 1985.[50] All of the video elements were produced by Howard G. Malley )Tj
T*(and Craig B. Golin along with April Lee Grebb as the production supervisor. )Tj
T*( The music video showed the recording of "We Are the World", and drew criticism )Tj
T*(from some. Michael Jackson joked before filming, "People will know it's me as )Tj
T*(soon as they see the socks. Try taking footage of Bruce Springsteen's socks and )Tj
T*(see if anyone knows who they belong to."[24] Jackson was also criticized for )Tj
T*(filming and recording his solo piece privately, away from the other artists. )Tj
T*(The singer's supporters reasoned that Jackson was a perfectionist; recording in )Tj
T*(front of other big name artists would leave him awestruck and unable to perform )Tj
T*(at his best. He was also known for his shy nature, and the idea of singing solo )Tj
T*(in front of 44 other famous artists probably sounded terrifying to him. )Tj
T*( The song was also promoted with a special edition of the American magazine )Tj
T*(Life. The publication had been the only media outlet permitted inside A&amp;M )Tj
T*(Recording Studios on the night of January 28, 1985. All other press )Tj
T*(organizations were barred from reporting the events leading up to and during )Tj
T*("We Are the World"'s recording. Life ran a cover story of the recording session )Tj
T*(in its April 1985 edition of the monthly magazine. Seven members of USA for )Tj
T*(Africa were pictured on the cover: Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, )Tj
T*(Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Willie Nelson. Inside the )Tj
T*(magazine were photographs of the "We Are the World" participants working and )Tj
T*(taking breaks.[50] )Tj
T*( On the morning of April 5, 1985 \(Good Friday of that year\), "We Are the World" )Tj
T*(received worldwide coverage. At 10:25¬†am, over 8000 radio stations )Tj
T*(simultaneously broadcast the song around the world. They played it to show )Tj
T*(their support for the relief of famine in Ethiopia.[27] The song was also )Tj
T*(broadcast by Muzak, a company which pipes background music into 110,000 stores )Tj
T*(and businesses in the US. It was the second time Muzak had played the sound of )Tj
T*("human voice", the first being an announcement on the release of American )Tj
T*(hostages in Iran in 1981.[52] As the song was broadcast, hundreds of people )Tj
T*(sang along on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[44][53] The )Tj
T*(simultaneous radio broadcast of "We Are the World" was repeated again the )Tj
T*(following Good Friday.[27] )Tj
T*( "We Are the World" gained further promotion and coverage on May 25, 1986, when )Tj
T*(it was played during a major benefit event held throughout the US.[54][55]Hands )Tj
T*(Across America‚ÄîUSA for Africa's follow-up project‚Äîwas an event in which )Tj
T*(millions of people formed a human chain across the US.[56] The event was held )Tj
T*(to draw attention to hunger and homelessness in the United States.[57] "We Are )Tj
T*(the World"'s co-writer, Michael Jackson, had wanted his song to be the official )Tj
T*(theme for the event. The other board members of USA for Africa outvoted the )Tj
T*(singer, and it was instead decided that a new song would be created and )Tj
T*(released for the event, titled "Hands Across America".[46] When released, the )Tj
T*(new song did not achieve the level of success that "We Are the World" did, and )Tj
T*(the decision to use it as the official theme for the event led to Jackson‚Äîwho )Tj
T*(co-owned the publishing rights to "We Are the World"‚Äîresigning from the board )Tj
T*(of directors of USA for Africa.[46][58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Humanitarian aid )Tj
T*( Four months after the release of "We Are the World", USA for Africa had taken )Tj
T*(in almost $10.8¬†million.[59][60] The majority of the money came from record )Tj
T*(sales within the US.[59][60] Members of the public also donated money‚Äîalmost )Tj

T*(estimated that they had sold between $45¬†million and $47¬†million worth of )Tj
T*(official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced that they )Tj
T*(would not be distributing all of the money at once. Instead, he revealed that )Tj
T*(the foundation would be looking into finding a long-term solution for Africa's )Tj

T*(problems.[59] )Tj
T*( In June 1985, the first USA for Africa cargo jet carrying food, medicine and )Tj
T*(clothing departed for Ethiopia and the Sudan. It stopped en route in New York, )Tj
T*(where 15,000¬†T-shirts were added to the cargo. Included in the supplies were )Tj
T*(high-protein biscuits, high-protein vitamins, medicine, tents, blankets and )Tj
T*(refrigeration equipment.[61] Harry Belafonte, representing the USA for Africa )Tj
T*(musicians, visited Sudan in the same month. The trip was his last stop on a )Tj
T*(four nation tour of Africa. Tanzanian Prime Minister Salim Ahmed Salim greeted )Tj
T*(and praised Belafonte, telling him, "I personally and the people of Tanzania )Tj
T*(are moved by this tremendous example of human solidarity."[62] )Tj
T*( One year after the release of "We Are the World", organizers noted that $44.5¬†)Tj
T*(million had been raised for USA for Africa's humanitarian fund. They stated )Tj
T*(that they were confident that they would reach an initial set target of $50¬†)Tj
T*(million.[63] By October 1986, it was revealed that their $50¬†million target had )Tj
T*(been met and exceeded; CBS Records gave USA for Africa a check for $2.5¬†)Tj
T*(million, drawing the total amount of money to $51.2¬†million.[64] USA for )Tj
T*(Africa's Hands Across America event had also raised a significant amount of )Tj
T*(money‚Äîapproximately $24.5¬†million for the hungry in the US.[64] )Tj
T*( Since its release, "We Are the World" has raised over $63¬†million for )Tj
T*(humanitarian causes.[65] Ninety percent of the money was pledged to African )Tj
T*(relief, both long and short term.[64][66] The long term initiative included )Tj
T*(efforts in birth control and food production.[66] The remaining 10¬†percent of )Tj
T*(funds was earmarked for domestic hunger and homeless programs in the )Tj
T*(US.[64][66] From the African fund, over 70¬†recovery and development projects )Tj
T*(were launched in seven African nations. Such projects included aid in )Tj
T*(agriculture, fishing, water management, manufacturing and reforestation. )Tj
T*(Training programs were also developed in the African countries of Mozambique, )Tj
T*(Senegal, Chad, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Mali.[64] )Tj
T*( [edit] Notable live performances )Tj
T*( "We Are the World" has been performed live by members of USA for Africa on )Tj
T*(several occasions both together and individually. One of the earliest such )Tj
T*(performances came in 1985, during the rock music concert Live Aid, which ended )Tj
T*(with more than 100¬†musicians singing the song on stage.[67][68] Harry Belafonte )Tj
T*(and Lionel Richie made surprise appearances for the live rendition of the )Tj
T*(song.[69] Michael Jackson would have joined the artists, but was "working )Tj

T*(to", according to his press agent, Norman Winter.[70] )Tj

T*(creatively.[45]Ebony described the January 28 recording session, in which )Tj
T*(Quincy Jones brought together a multi-racial group, as being "a major moment in )Tj
T*(world music that showed we can change the world".[92] "We Are the World", along )Tj
T*(with Live Aid and Farm Aid, demonstrated that rock music had become more than )Tj
T*(entertainment, but a political and social movement.[93] Journalist Robert )Tj
T*(Palmer noted that such songs and events had the ability to reach people around )Tj
T*(the world, send them a message, and then get results.[93] )Tj
T*( Since the release of "We Are the World", numerous songs have been recorded in )Tj
T*(a similar fashion, with the intent to aid famine victims throughout the world. )Tj
T*(One such example involved a supergroup of Latin musicians billed as "Hermanos )Tj
T*(del Tercer Mundo", or "Brothers of the Third World". Among the supergroup of 62¬†)Tj
T*(recording artists were Julio Iglesias, Jos√© Feliciano and S√©rgio Mendes. Their )Tj

T*(of the profits raised from the charity single was pledged to USA for Africa. )Tj
T*(The rest of the money was to be used for impoverished Latin American )Tj
T*(countries.[94] )Tj
T*( The 20th anniversary of "We Are the World" was celebrated in 2005. Radio )Tj

T*(for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In )Tj
T*(addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by the release of a )Tj
T*(two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song.[95] Ken Kragen )Tj
T*(asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA )Tj
T*(for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to "use it to do some )Tj
T*(more good [for the original charity]. That's all we care about )Tj
T*(accomplishing."[95] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20th¬†anniversary of )Tj
T*(the song. The entertainer acknowledged that "We Are the World" had "stood the )Tj

T*( Venture Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, )Tj
T*(first published from 1957 to 1958, and revived for a brief run in 1969 and )Tj
T*(1970. Ten issues were published of the 1950s version, with another six in the )Tj
T*(second run. It was founded in both instances as a companion to The Magazine of )Tj
T*(Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction; Robert P. Mills edited the 1950s version, and )Tj
T*(Edward L. Ferman was editor during the second run. A British edition appeared )Tj
T*(for 28 issues between 1963 and 1965; it reprinted material from The Magazine of )Tj
T*(Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction as well as from the US edition of Venture. There )Tj
T*(was also an Australian edition, which was identical to the British version but )Tj
T*(dated two months later. )Tj
T*( The original version was only moderately successful, although it is remembered )Tj
T*(for the first publication of Sturgeon's Law. The publisher, Joseph Ferman )Tj
T*(\(father of Edward Ferman\), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action )Tj
T*(and adventure; the resulting fiction contained more sex and violence than was )Tj
T*(usual for the science fiction \(sf\) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian )Tj
T*(Mike Ashley has suggested that the magazine was ahead of its time. It succumbed )Tj
T*(to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more )Tj
T*(successful, with less attractive cover art and little in the way of notable )Tj
T*(fiction, though it did publish Vonda McIntyre's first story. By the end of )Tj
T*(1970, Venture had ceased publication permanently. )Tj

T*(to F&amp;SF\) with the second issue, and the new magazine rapidly became )Tj
T*(successful and influential within the science fiction field.[1] The editors )Tj
T*(were Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas, and the managing editor was Robert )Tj
T*(P. Mills. In 1954, Joseph Ferman, a partner of Spivak's, bought the magazine )Tj
T*(from him.[2] Ferman subsequently decided to launch a companion magazine, and )Tj
T*(gave it to Mills to edit.[3] )Tj
T*( The new magazine was titled Venture Science Fiction, and the first issue was )Tj
T*(dated January 1957. Mills was managing editor of F&amp;SF throughout Venture's )Tj
T*(first run; he became editor of F&amp;SF shortly after Venture ceased publishing )Tj
T*(in July 1958.[3] The editorial philosophy was laid out by Ferman in the )Tj
T*(inaugural issue: "strong stories of action and adventure¬†... There will be two )Tj
T*(prime requisites for Venture stories: In the first place, each must be a )Tj
T*(well-told story, with a beginning, middle and end; in the second place, each )Tj
T*(must be a strong story‚Äîa story with pace, power and excitement."[4] Ferman )Tj
T*(hoped to take advantage of a gap in the science fiction magazine market opened )Tj
T*(up by the demise of Planet Stories, one of the last sf pulps, which had ceased )Tj
T*(publication in late 1955.[3]Planet Stories had focused on adventure stories, as )Tj
T*(opposed to the realistic style becoming more popular in science fiction in the )Tj
T*(1950s,[5] and Ferman hoped to combine the virtues of the melodramatic pulp )Tj
T*(fiction style with the literary values that were key to F&amp;SF's )Tj
T*(success.[3]Venture's bias towards action-oriented adventure led to stories with )Tj
T*(relatively more sex and violence than those in competing magazines, and sf )Tj
T*(historian Mike Ashley has commented that it was perhaps five or ten years ahead )Tj
T*(of its time. One story, "The Girl Had Guts", by Theodore Sturgeon, involved an )Tj
T*(alien virus that caused its victims to vomit up their intestines; Ashley )Tj
T*(records a reviewer saying that the story made him physically ill.[6][7] )Tj
T*( Ed Emshwiller supplied eight of the ten covers; he had sold several covers to )Tj
T*(F&amp;SF by this time, so his work reinforced the sense of connection between )Tj
T*(the two magazines.[3] Emshwiller also contributed interior illustrations in the )Tj
T*(first issue, but the main interior artist was John Giunta, with John Schoenherr )Tj

T*( Some well-known writers appeared during this incarnation of Venture, including )Tj
T*(Isaac Asimov, Clifford Simak, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Robert Silverberg, and )Tj
T*(Damon Knight. Not all the fiction was adventure oriented. For example, )Tj
T*(Sturgeon's story "The Comedian's Children" tells of a telethon host and his )Tj
T*(relationship with his sponsors, and Leigh Brackett's "All the Colors of the )Tj
T*(Rainbow" deals with racism after aliens have contacted humanity. These and )Tj
T*(other examples can be regarded as stories of character with strong themes, in )Tj
T*(keeping with Ferman's stated goals in his inaugural editorial.[3]Venture was )Tj
T*(also the place that "Sturgeon's Law" first saw print. This adage is now usually )Tj
T*(seen in the form "90% of everything is crap". It was formulated by Sturgeon in )Tj
T*(about 1951, and a version of it appeared in the March 1958 issue of Venture, )Tj
T*(under the name "Sturgeon's Revelation".[9][10] )Tj
T*( An editorial, "Venturings," appeared in each issue of the first series; after )Tj
T*(Ferman used the first one as a platform for editorial policy, it was usually )Tj
T*(written by Mills, who occasionally turned the column over to letters from SF )Tj
T*(figures. The very last editorial, in July 1958, featured a eulogy of C.M. )Tj
T*(Kornbluth by Frederik Pohl, and one of Henry Kuttner by Sturgeon. Kornbluth and )Tj
T*(Kuttner had died within two months of each other earlier that year.[3][8] )Tj
T*( Sturgeon began a book review column, "On Hand . . . Offhand", in the July 1957 )Tj
T*(issue that continued for the rest of the magazine's run. This was Sturgeon's )Tj
T*(first review column; more than a decade later he wrote a similar column for )Tj
T*(Galaxy Science Fiction. The January 1958 issue saw the first in a series of )Tj
T*(four science articles by Asimov that also continued until Venture folded. The )Tj
T*(series was transferred to F&amp;SF, beginning with the November 1958 issue, and )Tj

T*(of the competitors lasted for only one or two issues, Venture can be thought of )Tj
T*(as at least a partial success.[3] )Tj
T*( [edit] British and Australian editions )Tj
T*( In December 1959, a British edition of F&amp;SF appeared from Atlas Publishing )Tj
T*(and Distributing Limited, a London-based publisher. Atlas had published a )Tj
T*(British edition of Analog \(formerly Astounding Science Fiction\) since 1939. In )Tj
T*(1963 the abolition of import restrictions meant that Analog could be directly )Tj
T*(imported, and since there was no longer a need for a British edition, Atlas )Tj
T*(decided to start a new sf magazine to replace it. The new Venture Science )Tj
T*(Fiction drew many of its stories from the US version, but it also reprinted )Tj
T*(from the late 1950s F&amp;SF, since there had been no British edition of that )Tj
T*(magazine until the end of 1959. Within a year Atlas decided to abandon their )Tj
T*(edition of F&amp;SF as well; the last issue appeared in June 1964.[11] )Tj
T*( The British version of Venture began in September 1963, and ran for 28 )Tj
T*(numbered issues, through December 1965; the editor was Ronald R. Wickers.[12] )Tj
T*(The stories selected from F&amp;SF for the UK edition of Venture did not )Tj
T*(overlap with material already reprinted in the UK edition of F&amp;SF.[7] The )Tj
T*(first five issues had pictorial covers, but thereafter the cover simply listed )Tj
T*(the names of the contributing authors. This unattractive presentation, and the )Tj
T*(lack of much in the way of interior artwork, probably hurt sales. Atlas's )Tj
T*(stated reason for ending the magazine was that it was "due to the expiration of )Tj
T*(available material", but there were in fact many stories available to reprint. )Tj
T*(It is more likely that the real reason was that the US edition of F&amp;SF was )Tj
T*(by then easily available in the UK, and that circulation was falling.[11] )Tj
T*( Atlas also published an Australian edition, which was identical to the British )Tj
T*(edition except that it was dated two months later; the issues ran from November )Tj
T*(1963 to February 1966.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Second US run )Tj
T*( A little over ten years after the first US edition ceased, a new version )Tj
T*(appeared, again as a companion to F&amp;SF. This time the magazine was )Tj
T*(quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. )Tj
T*(Ferman‚Äîson of Joseph Ferman‚Äîwho was also the editor of F&amp;SF. There was no )Tj
T*(statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was )Tj
T*(straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were )Tj
T*(substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result )Tj
T*(that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, )Tj
T*(the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known )Tj
T*(writers.[7] However, the magazine was no more successful than before, and )Tj
T*(lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.[7] )Tj
T*( The condensed novels that appeared in this version of Venture included Hour of )Tj
T*(the Horde, by Gordon R. Dickson; Plague Ship, by Harry Harrison; Star Treasure, )Tj
T*(by Keith Laumer; and Beastchild, by Dean R. Koontz.[3][8] The short fiction )Tj
T*(included little of note, though "The Snows Are Melted, the Snows Are Gone", an )Tj
T*(early story by James Tiptree, Jr., appeared in 1969, and "Breaking Point", by )Tj
T*(Vonda McIntyre, was published in February 1970.[3] "Breaking Point" was )Tj
T*(McIntyre's first published fiction, but, perhaps because it was published as by )Tj
T*("V. N. McIntyre", it has been missed by several bibliographers.[13] There was )Tj
T*(also a Reginald Bretnor Feghoot story in each issue: these were a series of )Tj
T*(very short stories, based on bad puns, that had begun in F&amp;SF the previous )Tj
T*(year.[3] )Tj
T*( Ron Goulart contributed a book review column to each issue of the second )Tj
T*(incarnation, and there was an occasional film review.[3] This version of )Tj
T*(Venture did not credit the artists, but most of the covers were signed by Bert )Tj
T*(Tanner, who was listed on the masthead as the art director. Tanner's cover art )Tj
T*(was much less distinguished than Emshwiller's work for the first run of the )Tj
T*(magazine, and it is likely that this had a negative effect on sales: Tanner's )Tj
T*(work has been likened to "pencil sketches overlaid by a single color".[3] )Tj
T*(Tanner also contributed much, but not all, of the interior art; other artists )Tj
T*(who can by identified by their signatures include Emshwiller, Derek Carter, and )Tj
T*(Bhob Stewart, who illustrated Tiptree's story in the November 1969 issue.[8] )Tj

T*(feet, white forehead, a black nape and crown \(streaked white\), and white )Tj
T*(cheeks. The grey mantle is 305¬†mm, and the scapulae are fringed brown, some )Tj
T*(tipped white. The upper wing is grey with a white leading edge, and the collar )Tj
T*(is completely white, as is the rump. The deeply forked tail is whitish, with )Tj
T*(grey outer webs. The hindcrown to the ear-coverts is black. )Tj
T*( Arctic Terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching thirty years of age. )Tj
T*(They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species is abundant, )Tj
T*(with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend in the number of )Tj
T*(individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past )Tj
T*(has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range. )Tj
T*( [edit] Distribution and migration )Tj
T*( The Arctic Tern has a worldwide, circumpolar breeding distribution which is )Tj
T*(continuous; there are no recognized subspecies. It can be found in coastal )Tj
T*(regions in cooler temperate parts of North America and Eurasia during the )Tj
T*(northern summer. While wintering during the southern summer, it can be found at )Tj
T*(sea, reaching the southern edge of the Antarctic ice.[4] )Tj
T*( The Arctic Tern is famous for its migration; it flies from its Arctic breeding )Tj
T*(grounds to the Antarctic and back again each year. This 19,000¬†km \(12,000¬†mi\) )Tj
T*(journey each way ensures that this bird sees two summers per year and more )Tj
T*(daylight than any other creature on the planet.[5] One example of this bird's )Tj
T*(remarkable long-distance flying abilities involves an Arctic Tern ringed as an )Tj
T*(unfledged chick on the Farne Islands, Northumberland, UK, in the northern )Tj
T*(summer of 1982, which reached Melbourne, Australia, in October 1982, a sea )Tj
T*(journey of over 22,000¬†km \(14,000¬†mi\) in just three months from fledging.[6] )Tj
T*(Another example is that of a chick ringed in Labrador, Canada, on 23 July 1928. )Tj
T*(It was found in South Africa four months later.[7] )Tj
T*( Research using tracking devices attached to the birds was published in January )Tj
T*(2010 and showed that the above examples are in fact not unusual for the )Tj
T*(species; eleven Arctic Terns that bred in Greenland or Iceland each covered )Tj
T*(70,900¬†km on average in a year, with a maximum of 81,600¬†km. The difference )Tj
T*(from previous estimates was because the birds were found to take a meandering )Tj
T*(course to take advantage of prevailing winds.[3] The average Arctic Tern lives )Tj
T*(about twenty years, and will travel about 2.4 million km \(1.5 million mi\). )Tj
T*( Arctic Terns usually migrate far offshore.[8] Consequently, they are rarely )Tj
T*(seen from land outside the breeding season. )Tj
T*( [edit] Description and taxonomy )Tj
T*( The Arctic Tern is a medium-sized bird around 33‚Äì36¬†cm \(13‚Äì15¬†in\) from the tip )Tj

T*(86‚Äì127¬†g \(3.0‚Äì4.5¬†oz\). The beak is dark red, as are the short legs and webbed )Tj

T*(colonies, and the advertising call.[10] The advertising call is social in )Tj
T*(nature, made when returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters )Tj
T*(between individuals. It is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves )Tj
T*(a similar role to the bird song of passerines, identifying individuals. Eight )Tj
T*(other calls have been described, from begging calls made by females during )Tj
T*(mating to attack calls made while swooping at intruders. )Tj
T*( While the Arctic Tern is similar to the Common and Roseate Terns, its )Tj
T*(colouring, profile, and call are slightly different. Compared to the Common )Tj
T*(Tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences )Tj
T*(from the Roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic )Tj
T*(Tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the Common, and is easily )Tj
T*(distinguishable from that of the Roseate.[11] )Tj
T*( This bird's closest relatives are a group of South Polar species, the South )Tj
T*(American \(Sterna hirundinacea\), Kerguelen \(S. virgata\), and Antarctic \(S. )Tj
T*(vittata\) Terns.[12] On the wintering grounds, the Arctic Tern can be )Tj
T*(distinguished from these relatives; the six-month difference in moult is the )Tj
T*(best clue here, with Arctic Terns being in winter plumage during the southern )Tj
T*(summer. The southern species also do not show darker wingtips in flight. )Tj
T*( The immature plumages of Arctic Tern were originally described as separate )Tj
T*(species, Sterna portlandica and Sterna pikei.[13] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reproduction )Tj
T*( Breeding begins around the third or fourth year.[14] Arctic Terns mate for )Tj
T*(life, and in most cases, return to the same colony each year.[15]Courtship is )Tj
T*(elaborate, especially in birds nesting for the first time.[16] Courtship begins )Tj
T*(with a so-called "high flight", where a female will chase the male to a high )Tj
T*(altitude and then slowly descend. This display is followed by "fish flights", )Tj
T*(where the male will offer fish to the female. Courtship on the ground involves )Tj
T*(strutting with a raised tail and lowered wings. After this, both birds will )Tj
T*(usually fly and circle each other.[16] )Tj
T*( Both sexes agree on a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During )Tj
T*(this time, the male continues to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after )Tj
T*(this.[16] Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally )Tj
T*(inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the Common Tern. )Tj
T*(It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.[8] )Tj
T*( It is one of the most aggressive terns, fiercely defensive of its nest and )Tj
T*(young. It will attack humans and large predators, usually striking the top or )Tj
T*(back of the head. Although it is too small to cause serious injury to an animal )Tj
T*(of a human's size, it is still capable of drawing blood, and is capable of )Tj
T*(repelling many raptorial birds and smaller mammalian predators such as foxes )Tj
T*(and cats.[5] Other nesting birds, such as alcids, often incidentally benefit )Tj
T*(from the protection provided by nesting in an area defended by Arctic Terns. )Tj
T*( The nest is usually a depression in the ground, which may or may not be lined )Tj
T*(with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and )Tj
T*(camouflaged.[8] Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22‚Äì27 )Tj
T*(days and fledge after 21‚Äì24 days.[8] If the parents are disturbed and flush )Tj
T*(from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as )Tj
T*(34 days.[10] )Tj
T*( When hatched, the chicks are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the )Tj
T*(chicks begin to move around and explore their surroundings within one to three )Tj
T*(days after hatching.[17] Usually, they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks )Tj
T*(are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching.[18] Both )Tj
T*(parents care for hatchlings.[8] Chick diets always include fish, and parents )Tj
T*(selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves.[10] )Tj
T*(Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a )Tj
T*(month before being weaned off slowly.[8] After fledging, the juveniles learn to )Tj
T*(feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving.[19] They will )Tj
T*(fly south to winter with the help of their parents.[20] )Tj
T*( Arctic Terns are long-lived birds that spend considerable time raising only a )Tj
T*(few young, and are thus said to be K-selected.[21] The maximum recorded life )Tj

T*(years[15][23] A study in the Farne Islands estimated an annual survival rate of )Tj
T*(82%.[24] )Tj
T*( [edit] Ecology and behaviour )Tj
T*( The diet of the Arctic Tern varies depending on location and time, but is )Tj
T*(usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine )Tj
T*(crustaceans.[4][8] Fish species comprise the most important part of the diet, )Tj
T*(and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species )Tj
T*(are immature \(1‚Äì2 year old\) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, )Tj
T*(and capelin.[5] Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and )Tj
T*(krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and )Tj
T*(on their northern breeding grounds, insects.[17] )Tj
T*( Arctic Terns sometimes dip down to the surface of the water to catch prey )Tj
T*(close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding.[17] )Tj
T*(It is also thought that Arctic Terns may, in spite of their small size, )Tj
T*(occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle )Tj
T*(them into releasing their catches.[17] Several species are )Tj
T*(targeted‚Äîconspecifics, other terns \(like the Common Tern\), and some auk and )Tj
T*(grebe species.[10] )Tj
T*( While nesting, Arctic Terns are vulnerable to predation by cats and other )Tj
T*(animals.[4] Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger Herring )Tj
T*(Gull steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do )Tj
T*(isolated nesting sites.[19] While feeding, skuas, gulls, and other tern species )Tj
T*(will often harass the birds and steal their food.[25] They often form mixed )Tj
T*(colonies with other terns, such as Common and Sandwich Terns. )Tj
T*( [edit] Conservation status )Tj

T*(states. They are also among the species to which the Agreement on the )Tj
T*(Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.[26] The species )Tj
T*(reduced population in New England in the late nineteenth-century because of )Tj
T*(hunting for the millinery trade.[10] Exploitation continues today in western )Tj
T*(Greenland, where the species has reduced population greatly since 1950.[27] )Tj
T*( At the southern part of their range, the Arctic Tern has been reducing in )Tj
T*(numbers. Much of this is due to lack of food.[9] However, most of these birds' )Tj

T*( "The Other Woman" is the 78th episode of the serial drama television series )Tj
T*(Lost and the sixth episode of the show's fourth season. It aired on March¬†6, )Tj
T*(2008 on the American Broadcasting Company \(ABC\) in the United States and on CTV )Tj
T*(in Canada.[1] The episode was written by co-executive producer Drew Goddard and )Tj
T*(executive story editor Christina M. Kim, and was directed by Eric )Tj
T*(Laneuville.[2] )Tj
T*( The narrative begins on December 24, 2004, 94 days after the crash of Oceanic )Tj
T*(Airlines Flight¬†815. Recent island arrivals Daniel Faraday \(played by Jeremy )Tj
T*(Davies\) and Charlotte Lewis \(Rebecca Mader\) leave the survivors' camp without )Tj
T*(notice for the Dharma Initiative electrical station called the Tempest. In )Tj
T*(flashbacks that depict events on the island, Juliet Burke \(Elizabeth Mitchell\) )Tj
T*(discovers that her boss Ben Linus \(Michael Emerson\), the leader of the island's )Tj
T*(original inhabitants referred to as the Others, is in love with her.[3] )Tj
T*( The writers advanced several story lines with "The Other Woman". The episode )Tj
T*(furthers Juliet's back story and relationships, sheds more light on the )Tj
T*(season's new characters, and features the first appearance of Harper Stanhope )Tj
T*(\(Andrea Roth\). The introduction of the Tempest further develops the series' )Tj
T*(mythology, specifically the "purge". In the third season, the purge was )Tj
T*(mentioned in episode "Enter 77" and seen in "The Man Behind the Curtain".[4] )Tj
T*( "The Other Woman" was watched by 15 million Americans and received mixed )Tj
T*(reviews. Critics from the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and BuddyTV )Tj
T*(deemed it the worst episode of the season, partially due to a flashback )Tj
T*(storyline that was seemingly recycled from the third season episode, "One of )Tj
T*(Us". Another criticism was that audiences actually learned more about Ben than )Tj
T*(Juliet, despite the focus on Juliet. Emerson also received more praise for his )Tj
T*(acting than Mitchell, who plays Juliet; however, Mitchell won a Saturn Award )Tj
T*(for her performance. Positive reviews commended the action in the episode's )Tj
T*(climax. )Tj
T*( The episode opens with flashbacks to Juliet's life on the island following her )Tj
T*(recruitment in September 2001 by the Others.[5] Juliet has an affair with an )Tj
T*(Other named Goodwin \(Brett Cullen\), who is married to therapist Harper )Tj
T*(Stanhope. Harper discovers the affair, and warns Juliet that their leader Ben )Tj
T*(will punish Goodwin because he has a crush on Juliet. Following the crash of )Tj
T*(Flight 815, Ben sends him to infiltrate a group of surviving passengers; )Tj
T*(Goodwin is killed by Ana Lucia Cortez after she realizes he is not a )Tj
T*(survivor.[6] In October 2004, Ben invites Juliet to what he initially describes )Tj
T*(as a dinner party, but is actually a private date. Ben leads Juliet to )Tj
T*(Goodwin's impaled corpse, where she accuses him of having wanted Goodwin to )Tj
T*(die. Ben reveals his love for her.[7] )Tj
T*( On the night of December 24, 2004 \(three months after the crash of Flight )Tj
T*(815\), two members of a science team from the Kahana freighter anchored )Tj
T*(offshore[8]‚ÄîDaniel and Charlotte‚Äîwho landed on the island three days earlier )Tj
T*(with a hidden agenda, sneak off to find the Tempest. Juliet and the crash )Tj
T*(survivors' leader Jack Shephard \(Matthew Fox\) notice their absence from the )Tj
T*(beach camp and pursue them. After hearing the whispers, Harper approaches )Tj
T*(Juliet. She tells her that Daniel and Charlotte intend to kill everyone on the )Tj
T*(island by deploying a lethal gas at the Tempest and that Ben's orders are for )Tj
T*(Juliet to kill them. On a trek back to the beach in the morning, Kate )Tj
T*(encounters Daniel and Charlotte and is knocked unconscious by the latter. Jack )Tj
T*(and Juliet come across Kate and they split up: Juliet continues for the Tempest )Tj
T*(alone, as Jack minds Kate. Inside the station, Juliet finds Daniel in a hazmat )Tj
T*(suit at a computer. After a standoff, Daniel and Charlotte convince Juliet that )Tj
T*(they are not going to kill anyone; they are neutralizing the gas in case Ben )Tj
T*(decides to use it again, as he had twelve years earlier in an Others-led purge )Tj
T*(of Dharma.[9] Jack arrives at the Tempest and Juliet explains that those on the )Tj
T*(freighter came to the island to wage war against Ben and she expects him to )Tj
T*(win. She fears for Jack because Ben thinks that she belongs to him, but Jack )Tj
T*(shows no worry and kisses her.[7] )Tj

T*(the freighter is. Ben continues to reside in the Barracks following his )Tj
T*(release.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Production )Tj
T*( When asked about what she learned about her character through "The Other )Tj
T*(Woman", Elizabeth Mitchell surmised that Juliet's "mistakes are morally )Tj
T*(questionable, if not morally wrong. But you do see that behind this is a human )Tj
T*(being who is struggling to live and have a life that makes sense to her."[12] )Tj
T*(Mitchell did not think that Juliet was too surprised that Ben has romantic )Tj
T*(feelings for her, but "it was horrifying under the circumstances" because she )Tj
T*(had just found out that Goodwin had died. Michael Emerson thought that his )Tj
T*(character Ben was childish when he shouted "you're mine!" to Juliet; Mitchell )Tj
T*(compared him to "a twelve-year-old boy throwing a temper tantrum over¬†... his )Tj
T*(first love".[13] Mitchell said that "it was emotionally draining shooting this )Tj
T*(episode" because she was intimidated by Emerson and Matthew Fox's acting )Tj
T*(skills.[11] )Tj
T*( Co-executive producer and staff writer Adam Horowitz stated that "It's always )Tj
T*(interesting to pull back another layer on one of our characters, and to see )Tj
T*(another chapter in Juliet's story on the island and bring us to where she is )Tj
T*(now was great", while fellow co-executive producer and staff writer Edward )Tj
T*(Kitsis thought that "the interesting thing about the episode is the way Ben )Tj
T*(looks at Juliet ... everything is informed by that look." Horowitz also enjoyed )Tj
T*(the juxtaposition of Juliet's character development with the revelations on the )Tj
T*("freighter folk". Kitsis picked the episode's final scene where Hugo "Hurley" )Tj
T*(Reyes \(Jorge Garcia\) and James "Sawyer" Ford \(Josh Holloway\) discover that Ben )Tj
T*(has negotiated his release and will be dining with them that evening as his )Tj
T*(favorite of the episode.[14] Actress Rebecca Mader, who plays Charlotte, said )Tj
T*(that she was "so excited" for the episode to air because she thought that it )Tj
T*(was "even better" than the previous episode,[15] which is widely regarded as )Tj
T*(one of the best episodes of the series.[16] Charlotte knocks Kate unconscious )Tj
T*(with the barrel of her gun and asks "what?" to a speechless Daniel in "The )Tj
T*(Other Woman". Mader found this hilarious and described it as "the pinnacle of )Tj
T*([her] career".[17] )Tj
T*( Andrea Roth makes her first appearance as Harper in "The Other Woman". During )Tj
T*(casting in early October, Harper was described as "a tough, no-nonsense and )Tj
T*(beautiful [therapist who has a tendency to be] overly controlling and )Tj
T*(obsessive." The character was also noted as a recurring role;[18] however, )Tj
T*(Harper did not make another appearance in the season. The writers have since )Tj
T*(stated that she will eventually reappear.[19] A jungle scene with Mitchell, Fox )Tj
T*(and Roth was filmed until 4:00¬†a.m. on October¬†27, 2007[20] with industrial )Tj
T*(sprinklers[21] and Mitchell referred to this as her "most intense experience on )Tj
T*(the show".[22] Harper's appearance and disappearance in this scene are sudden )Tj
T*(so fans speculated that this was actually an apparition or manifestation of the )Tj
T*(island's black smoke monster. This was refuted by Lost's writers.[23] )Tj
T*( Named after William Shakespeare's 1610 play of the same name, the Tempest )Tj
T*(first appears in "The Other Woman" and is apparently alluded to on an unseen )Tj
T*(layer of the Dharma "Swan" station's blast door map of the second season.[19] )Tj
T*(The writers wanted to explain some of the island's history in the fourth season )Tj
T*(and decided that "The Other Woman" would reveal where the gas that Ben used )Tj
T*(came from and that Dharma had stations set up for protection against hostile )Tj
T*(forces. They also enjoyed having Goodwin on the show and wanted to bring him )Tj
T*(back.[19] "The Other Woman" had commenced filming by October¬†11, 2007[24] and )Tj
T*(was completed on October¬†30.[25] )Tj
T*( "The Other Woman" contains Jack and Juliet's second kiss.[26] Juliet was )Tj
T*(conceived by the writers as the next possible love interest for Jack[27] after )Tj
T*(the death of the second season character Ana Lucia Cortez \(Michelle )Tj
T*(Rodriguez\).[28] Fans hated Ana Lucia so the writers did not pursue the romantic )Tj
T*(story arc.[29] Mitchell guesses that her character was created because "they )Tj

T*(needed a bridge between Ben and everyone else, and they needed someone to come )Tj

T*(Juliet did genuinely fall in love with Jack,[30] but not knowing whether "her )Tj
T*(attraction to Jack or her willingness to do anything to get off the island" is )Tj
T*(more important to her.[11] Juliet forms something of a "love rectangle" with )Tj
T*(Jack, Kate and Sawyer.[31] Mitchell "feel[s] like [Jack and Juliet have] a very )Tj
T*(grown-up relationship. They seem to really respect and like each other", )Tj
T*(whereas Sawyer and Kate are like "rambunctious teenagers".[11] The couple has )Tj
T*(gained an Internet fandom and been given the portmanteau nickname "Jacket".[32] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception )Tj
T*( "The Other Woman" was watched live or recorded and watched within five hours )Tj
T*(of broadcast by 13.008¬†million viewers in the United States,[33] ranking )Tj
T*(seventh for the week in television programs with the most viewers and achieving )Tj
T*(a 5.4/13 in the coveted adults aged eighteen to forty-nine demographic.[34] )Tj
T*(Including those who watched within seven days of broadcast, the episode was )Tj
T*(watched by a total of 14.933¬†million American viewers; this number went toward )Tj
T*(the season's average.[35] 1.439¬†million Canadians watched it, making Lost the )Tj
T*(eighth highest-rated show of the week.[36] In the United Kingdom, 1.1¬†million )Tj
T*(people viewed the episode.[37] The episode brought in 691,000 viewers in )Tj
T*(Australia, placing it as the twenty-second most watched show of the night.[38] )Tj
T*( A common claim by critics of Entertainment Weekly, IGN,[39]SyFy Portal, AOL's )Tj
T*(TV Squad[40] and BuddyTV was that more was learned about supporting player Ben, )Tj
T*(instead of Juliet who was centered on in flashbacks. Jeff Jensen of )Tj
T*(Entertainment Weekly praised Emerson's acting and stated that "in the end, this )Tj
T*(was really a story about Ben and the lengths he will go to protect himself and )Tj
T*(the Island from his enemies."[41] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora said that "The more )Tj
T*(I hate Ben, the more I realize that Michael Emerson is just a very fine actor )Tj
T*(doing his job."[42] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting "god" and )Tj
T*(said that "The Other Woman" was "ostensibly a Juliet episode, [but] Ben's )Tj
T*(presence made a far bigger impression on me".[43] Despite Emerson's shadow, )Tj
T*(Elizabeth Mitchell received the award for "Best Supporting Actress on )Tj
T*(Television" at the 34th Saturn Awards in a tie with Summer Glau, who plays )Tj
T*(Cameron Phillips in FOX's Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.[44] )Tj
T*( "The Other Woman" has been cited as the weakest episode of Lost's fourth )Tj
T*(season. Despite his claim, Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times pointed out )Tj
T*(that "even this so-so episode of Lost stood far above anything else being shown )Tj
T*(on network TV this season". He noted that the "most heartbreaking scene" was )Tj
T*(Claire Littleton's \(Emilie de Ravin\) appearance because it reminded him of how )Tj
T*(little the character had done to advance the season's plot.[45] BuddyTV's John )Tj
T*(Kubicek dubbed "The Other Woman" "the worst episode of Lost season four so far" )Tj
T*(because it "followed the soap opera that is the romantic entanglements of the )Tj
T*(major players, which is not the reason most people love Lost."[46] Jeff Jensen )Tj
T*(of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode as a "C‚Äì" and called it "the only )Tj
T*(true dud of the season".[47] He thought that its "story was kinda all over the )Tj
T*(place" and that "the whole thing felt forced". Jensen was not fond of Andrea )Tj
T*(Roth's guest performance because he felt that "she came off as too arch and )Tj
T*(unreal."[48] In contrast, TV Guide's Bruce Fretts praised Roth's "suitably )Tj
T*(creepy" appearance.[49] Other critics also reviewed the episode as poor. )Tj
T*(Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune said that "The Other Woman" "seemed somewhat )Tj
T*(pallid and predictable ‚Ä¶ several elements ‚Ä¶ felt like they'd been recycled from )Tj
T*(previous seasons and story arcs."[50]The Star-Ledger's Alan Sepinwall )Tj
T*(considered the episode to be the second weakest of the fourth season after )Tj
T*("Eggtown". He criticized the Tempest storyline due to a lack of explanation for )Tj
T*(the station's original purpose and thought that Juliet's flashbacks were )Tj
T*(redundant.[51] )Tj
T*( "The Other Woman" was also the subject of mixed reviews. Tim Goodman of the )Tj
T*(San Francisco Chronicle wrote that "I really liked this episode, but I liked it )Tj
T*(less than the [preceding episodes] ‚Ä¶ it seems that someone took their foot off )Tj
T*(the gas just a fraction and the reduction in speed was notable.[52]Time's James )Tj

T*(although "not nearly as much" as the previous episode. She rejoiced at the )Tj
T*(return of her "favorite Other" Tom \(M.C. Gainey\) and wrote that "Locke used to )Tj
T*(be one of [her] favorite characters, but now he's a tool".[54]Digital Spy's Ben )Tj
T*(Rawson-Jones stated that "the episode came together nicely in the end, with an )Tj
T*(expected twist and a snog, although for a great part it bordered on tedium. )Tj
T*(Juliet is a character who simply isn't interesting enough to fully sustain )Tj
T*(one's attention over a flashback. She's been so peripheral and irrelevant over )Tj
T*(this season, and it felt like a token gesture to foreground her at last. There )Tj
T*(was a nice pay off though, with a long awaited smooch between her and )Tj
T*(Jack."[55] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as a "C+"; however, he wrote that )Tj
T*("the Ben/Locke scenes were great and Juliet in a bikini did not )Tj
T*(disappoint."[56] TV Squad's Erin Martell was "not impressed with Jack and )Tj

T*(Emerson's acting, Ben's one-liners and his "too funny for words" casual )Tj
T*(greeting to Hurley and Sawyer at the end of the episode after he is released )Tj
T*(from captivity.[40]The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought that "this was )Tj

T*(there was still a lot of solid character development."[57] )Tj
T*( Verne Gay of Newsday referred to the episode as "yet another brilliant outing )Tj

T*(image appeared on toys and in advertisements throughout the city. The zoo )Tj
T*(announced in May 2008 that United Nations Environment Program chief Achim )Tj
T*(Steiner would be Flocke's official patron with the hope of using the bear as an )Tj
T*(ambassador to encourage awareness of climate change. In late 2008, a )Tj
T*(Russian-born male polar bear named Rasputin was introduced to Flocke's )Tj
T*(enclosure in the hopes that she would gain valuable socializing skills with a )Tj
T*(member of her own species. In April 2010, both bears were relocated to )Tj
T*(Marineland in southern France. )Tj
T*( [edit] Infancy and controversy )Tj
T*( Flocke was born at the Nuremberg Zoo on 11 December 2007 to Vera \(born 2002 in )Tj
T*(Moscow\) and Felix \(born 2001 in Vienna\).[1] Felix also mated with Vera's sister )Tj
T*(Vilma, who gave birth some weeks earlier in November to what officials thought )Tj
T*(were two cubs. Zookeepers, enforcing a strict non-interference policy, were not )Tj
T*(able to determine exactly how many cubs were born.[2] The zoo reportedly did )Tj
T*(not wish to create a media circus similar to the one that surrounded Knut, an )Tj
T*(orphaned polar bear at the Berlin Zoo who became an international celebrity the )Tj
T*(previous year. Days after the zoo reaffirmed its non-interference policy, mass )Tj
T*(circulation daily Bild ran a story with a headline reading "Why Won't Anyone )Tj
T*(Save the Cute Baby Knuts in Nuremberg Zoo?"[4] )Tj
T*( At the beginning of January, zoo keepers noticed that Vilma appeared nervous; )Tj
T*(she was seen agitatedly scratching at her feedbox, and there was no further )Tj
T*(sign of her cubs. It is believed that she devoured them. When asked for a )Tj
T*(reason, Nuremberg zoo director Dag Encke stated that they could have been ill, )Tj
T*(a circumstance under which polar bears in the wild often eat their young.[2] )Tj
T*(The zoo quickly faced harsh criticism throughout Germany and from the worldwide )Tj
T*(media for appearing to allow the cubs' death. The director of the German Animal )Tj
T*(Protection Society said the zoo had acted irresponsibly and that "it was the )Tj
T*(ethical responsibility of the management to give the polar bear cubs a chance )Tj
T*(of life. Using the argument 'That's Nature' as an excuse for intervening far )Tj
T*(too late is cynical and inappropriate."[4] Angry visitors gathered in front of )Tj
T*(the polar bear enclosure and shouted "Rabenmutter" \(literally, "raven mother," )Tj
T*(meaning "evil mother"\) every time Vilma appeared.[5] )Tj
T*( Meanwhile, Vera was seen emerging from her den for the first time; her single )Tj
T*(cub, helpless at only four weeks old, appeared to be in good health. A couple )Tj
T*(of days after the media backlash that followed Vilma's missing cubs, Vera began )Tj
T*(displaying strange behavior such as carrying her then-unnamed cub around the )Tj
T*(enclosure and repeatedly dropping it on the hard rock floor. Concerned for the )Tj
T*(cub's safety, the Nuremberg Zoo made a controversial decision to remove her )Tj
T*(from her mother's care and raise her by hand. )Tj
T*( Less than a week after Vera's cub was removed from the polar bear enclosure, )Tj
T*(the zoo dedicated a website to the cub. It provided frequent updates on her )Tj
T*(health and development, as well as exclusive photographs and videos. The )Tj
T*(website also showcased a competition in which fans could vote for the cub's )Tj
T*(name.[6] The official name was announced on 18 January 2008 by Ulrich Maly, )Tj
T*(mayor of Nuremberg, and broadcast live on television. Despite the overwhelming )Tj
T*(number of e-mailed suggestions from across the world \(including "Stella", )Tj
T*("Knutschi", "Sissi" and "Yuki Chan"[7]\), the zoo officially named her Flocke, )Tj
T*(German for "flake", as in "snowflake". "Flocke", used widely by the media )Tj
T*(previous to her official naming, was the nickname originally given to her by )Tj
T*(zookeepers because of her white fur.[8] )Tj
T*( Flocke's growth was carefully reported by the media during her first few )Tj
T*(months. Four zookeepers took turns bottle-feeding the cub with 140 milliliters )Tj
T*(of artificial milk every four hours[9] and news of her eyes opening for the )Tj
T*(first time made headlines a few days before she was officially named.[10] At )Tj
T*(five weeks old, she was referred to by the publication Bild as "Mrs. Knut", )Tj
T*(suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates when they )Tj
T*(mature.[11] As she grew, Flocke's diet was enriched with dog food, and boiled )Tj
T*(bones were supplied for her to chew on when she was three months old.[12] She )Tj
T*(was soon taken to the zoo's beginners' pool to practice her swimming )Tj
T*(skills.[12] The zoo had previously stated that they were seeking another )Tj

T*(orphaned polar or brown bear cub to raise alongside Flocke in order to improve )Tj
T*(her development. )Tj
T*( On 8 April 2008, Flocke made her first public appearance in the polar bear )Tj
T*(enclosure that had once been home to Vilma; the adult polar bear had been )Tj
T*(relocated to another zoo. The four-month-old cub was greeted by more than 160 )Tj
T*(journalists and a half-dozen international camera crews on the first day.[12] )Tj
T*(During the first week, Flocke was displayed for short intervals with breaks at )Tj
T*(midday. Expecting a peak of 20,000 visitors, the zoo built a viewing platform, )Tj
T*(capable of holding 500 people at a time, in front of the enclosure,[13] but )Tj
T*(attendance by zoo patrons was initially lower than expected.[14] The zoo uses a )Tj
T*(video transmission and recording system from Bosch Security Systems to transmit )Tj
T*(TV-quality live images of the cub to a pair of 46-inch \(1,200¬†mm\) large-format )Tj
T*(screens. This system, which includes one screen outside the enclosure, was )Tj
T*(implemented to help the zoo meet the demands of visitors wanting to catch a )Tj
T*(glimpse of Flocke.[15] )Tj
T*( Shortly after her debut, however, Flocke became the focus of controversy when )Tj
T*(prominent animal conservationist J√ºrgen Ortm√ºller, chairman of the Whale and )Tj
T*(Dolphin Protection Forum, hired a lawyer to stop Nuremberg Zoo's exploitation )Tj
T*(of the polar bear cub.[16] Claiming that Flocke's public exposure would have )Tj
T*(damaging effects and that the zoo was only concerned about earning money, )Tj
T*(Ortm√ºller recruited high-profile lawyer Rolf Bossi to challenge them in )Tj
T*(court.[17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Merchandising and branding )Tj
T*( Soon after Flocke was rescued in January, the city secured branding rights to )Tj
T*(her name.[7] An official logo was subsequently released by the zoo.[18] Flocke )Tj
T*(became part of a major publicity campaign in Nuremberg when she was depicted )Tj
T*(along with the phrase "Knut war gestern" \(Knut is yesterday's bear\) on posters )Tj
T*(for the city's metropolitan region. These posters were displayed at numerous )Tj
T*(bus and train stops all over the city.[12] )Tj
T*( Dubbed "Flocke fever" by the press \(similar to the "Knutmania" from the )Tj
T*(previous year\), the cub's popularity soared in early 2008. Her image has been )Tj
T*(used for games, diaries, soft toys, DVDs, postcards and other items.[19] The )Tj
T*(first product released, a Flocke-based board game that was released in )Tj
T*(February, was made by the Fuerth-based firm Noris-Spiele, a unit of Georg )Tj
T*(Reulein GmbH &amp; Co. KG.[20] The well-known toy company Steiff began selling )Tj
T*(a variety of Flocke stuffed animals the following May. The income from the )Tj
T*(merchandise is currently going towards the zoo and to species survival )Tj
T*(programs.[19] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later publicity )Tj
T*( In April 2008, the zoo decreased human interaction with the cub, hoping that )Tj
T*(one day she could coexist with members of her species and not be dependent on )Tj
T*(humans. Becoming more independent from her keepers, Flocke was reported often )Tj
T*(playing happily on her own.[21] She was given a plastic "dummy", similar to a )Tj
T*(child's teething ring, tied to the bars on the inside of her stable door to )Tj
T*(suckle on while resting. This suckling caused the cub's nose to appear bent; )Tj
T*(her muzzle remained in this shape for some time before returning to normal.[21] )Tj
T*( At the age of six months, it was reported that Flocke, whose diet at the time )Tj
T*(consisted mostly of a kilogram of beef, assorted vegetables and a liter of )Tj
T*(puppy milk a day, was at the correct weight for her development at 45 kilograms )Tj
T*(\(99¬†lb\). The zoo's vet, Bernhard Neurohr, also remarked upon the bear's sweet )Tj
T*(tooth, stating that "Flocke is very enthusiastic about grapes, melon, kiwi )Tj
T*(fruit and pears", with a particular fondness for bananas.[22] )Tj
T*( United Nations Environment Program chief Achim Steiner became Flocke's )Tj
T*(official patron in May 2008.[23] By assuming this role, Steiner acknowledged )Tj
T*(Nuremberg Zoo's efforts towards local climate protection, stating "I am happy )Tj
T*(to have been asked to become 'godfather' to Nuremberg's polar bear cub Flocke. )Tj
T*(I sincerely hope that during her lifetime we will be able to implement a global )Tj
T*(green economy."[24] )Tj
T*( In June 2008, a new poster campaign featuring Flocke was announced; its goal )Tj

T*(climate. Sponsored by the Nuremberg Zoo in conjunction with the Nuremberg )Tj
T*(Metropolitan Region, the poster showed Flocke and the phrase "Klimaschutz )Tj
T*(beginnt vor Ort" \("Climate Protection Begins At Home"\).[25] The zoo also )Tj
T*(published a pocket-sized brochure featuring Flocke. Entitled "Little Guide to )Tj
T*(Climate Protection", it taught visitors how to decrease their carbon dioxide )Tj
T*(emissions.[25] The Nuremberg Zoo announced in September that it had reached its )Tj
T*(one millionth visitor for 2008‚Äîtwo months earlier than last year. Although )Tj
T*(ticket sales for the year increased due to Flocke's popularity, the numbers did )Tj
T*(not match high expectations.[26] The same month it was announced that the cub, )Tj
T*(now weighing 60 kilograms \(130¬†lb\), would no longer have lunchtime breaks in )Tj
T*(her stable, and would remain in the enclosure throughout the day.[27] )Tj
T*( [edit] Rasputin and move to France )Tj
T*( In late November 2008, Flocke's mother Vera gave birth to two cubs, who were )Tj
T*(fathered by Flocke's father, Felix. Although Vera was able to care for the new )Tj
T*(cubs without assistance from zoo keepers, Director Dag Encke initially stated )Tj
T*(that the cubs had a 50 percent chance of survival.[28] Three weeks after their )Tj
T*(birth was reported, both cubs died of natural causes within one week of each )Tj
T*(other. Encke expressed regret after the second cub's death, stating that "Vera )Tj
T*(nursed regularly and the young animal always slept well afterwards, so it )Tj
T*(seemed certain that it received enough milk. The reason that the young animal )Tj
T*(wasted away so quickly is not known."[29] )Tj
T*( A male polar bear cub named Rasputin was relocated from Moscow to the )Tj
T*(Nuremberg Zoo in December 2008 for what was thought to be an extended stay )Tj
T*(before his permanent move to the Zoo Aquarium de Madrid. Originally meant to )Tj
T*(remain in Germany for only a year, the male bear‚Äîcalled "Raspi" by fans‚Äîshared )Tj
T*(Flocke's enclosure. The zoo hoped that Rasputin, who unlike Flocke was raised )Tj
T*(by his mother, would teach their celebrity bear how to interact with those of )Tj
T*(her own species. According to a statement given by the city, the bears "get )Tj
T*(along famously".[30] )Tj
T*( On 21 October 2009, the city of Nuremberg announced that Flocke and Rasputin )Tj
T*(would move together to a newly constructed enclosure at Marineland, located in )Tj
T*(Antibes, France, at the beginning of 2010.[30] Due to the close relationship )Tj
T*(between the two adolescent bears, officials from the European Conservation )Tj
T*(Breeding Program \(Europ√§ischen Erhaltungszucht-Programms, or "EEP"\) decided )Tj
T*(that the two bears should remain together despite earlier plans for Rasputin to )Tj
T*(relocate to Madrid alone. The enclosure they are vacating in Nuremberg will be )Tj
T*(utilized by Flocke's parents, Vera and Felix, in the hopes that they will )Tj
T*(produce more cubs.[31] Despite last minute efforts by the animal right's group )Tj
T*(PETA to halt the move based on concerns for Flocke and Rasputin's well-being, )Tj
T*(the two bears arrived safely in France on 22 April 2010.[32] )Tj

T*( In 1968, Canadian Lady changed its name to Canadian Lady-Canadelle Inc., was )Tj
T*(sold to Consolidated Foods \(now Sara Lee Corporation\), and later became )Tj
T*(Canadelle Inc. During the 1970s Wonderbra was repositioned as the company's )Tj
T*(fashionable and sexy brand, and became the Canadian market leader.[2] )Tj
T*( In 1991, the push-up Wonderbra became a sensation in the UK, although it had )Tj

T*(patent sketches and close-ups of a bra made in the U.S. by D'Amour. The model )Tj
T*(is wearing a rare 1950s version of this original Wonder-Bra design. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( In 1939, Moe Nadler founded the Canadian Lady Corset Company. He created a )Tj
T*(small sewing shop in the heart of Montreal to make a well fitting, good quality )Tj
T*(bra in the mid-priced range \(from $1.00 to $1.50 retail\). As part of this )Tj
T*(effort, he traveled to New York City and met with Israel Pilot and licensed the )Tj
T*(Wonder-Bra trademark and diagonal slash patent.[6] In Canada, the trademark )Tj
T*(lost the hyphen, and became "WonderBra," and "Wonderbra" at the U.S. )Tj
T*(reintroduction. )Tj
T*( During the wartime years, Canadian apparel manufacturers were subject to )Tj
T*(quotas on materials. Elastics were unavailable, affecting the comfort and )Tj
T*(design of women's underwear. The diagonal slash offered a better fitting )Tj
T*(brassiere without elastics, and became a competitive advantage.[6] )Tj
T*( From 1939 - 1955, Canadian Lady marketed several lines of intimate apparel )Tj
T*(including girdles, panties, slips, swimsuits, and brassieres under the )Tj
T*(Wonderbra brand. The Company also created sub-brands to target different )Tj
T*(socioeconomic and lifestyle segments of the consumer market. In contrast, the )Tj
T*(U.S. market for Wonder-Bra stagnated while the brand was owned by Israel )Tj
T*(Pilot's companies. In 1952, Canadian Lady launched Petal Burst with )Tj
T*(anticipation of tough negotiations with D'Amour‚ÄîIsrael Pilot's U.S. )Tj
T*(company‚Äîaround the expiration of the patent in 1955. This new line also adapted )Tj
T*(to a new fashion trend towards a pointed bust, inspired by Christian Dior's )Tj
T*("New Look". The Petal Burst by Wonderbra line was successful and delivered 50% )Tj
T*(of bra sales by 1957.[7] )Tj
T*( The post-patent negotiations were led by Moe Nadler. D'Amour no longer had )Tj
T*(leverage with a patent, but still demanded that Canadian Lady stop using the )Tj
T*(designs, and return the pattern templates. Moe Nadler ignored this demand and )Tj
T*(instead successfully acquired the Canadian, European, and Asian rights to the )Tj
T*(Wonderbra trademarks. This allowed the company to move forward into the 1960s )Tj
T*(with the brand intact. By the mid 1960s Canadian Lady was exporting and )Tj
T*(licensing the Wonderbra line to Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, Israel )Tj
T*(and the West Indies.[8] In the 1970s, Canadelle acquired the remaining )Tj
T*(worldwide rights to the trademark, and licensed Giltex \(a Canadian pantyhose )Tj
T*(manufacturer acquired by Sara Lee in the 1980s\) to use the Wonderbra brand on )Tj
T*(hosiery in Canada. )Tj
T*( [edit] Development of the push-up bra )Tj
T*( In the late 1950s Moe Nadler started traveling to Europe to find new styles to )Tj
T*(bring to the Canadian market. In 1960, Wonderbra introduced a lacy, half )Tj
T*(push-up bra described in Europe as Pigeonnant \(meaning "pigeon-breasted" in )Tj
T*(French\). In 1961 Nadler directed Louise Poirier to develop a deeply plunged, )Tj
T*(laced push-up design, numbered the 1300. Canadian Lady licensed these models, )Tj
T*(among others, to Gossard in 1964. It was this Wonderbra Model 1300 design that )Tj
T*(became first a UK success in the early 1990s, a European sensation in 1993, and )Tj
T*(then the "One and Only Wonderbra" that was finally launched in the U.S. in )Tj
T*(1994.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Canadian product, 1964 to 1980 )Tj
T*( In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the majority of women were still wearing )Tj
T*(highly-structured undergarments.[10]Girdles were considered the ladylike norm )Tj
T*(and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also )Tj
T*(brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual )Tj
T*(revolution. The feminist movement‚Äîcultured by thought leaders like Betty )Tj
T*(Friedan and Germaine Greer‚Äîquestioned the mores that defined women's roles and )Tj
T*(appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose and the rise of the )Tj
T*(miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of )Tj
T*(women.[11] While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a )Tj
T*(precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their )Tj
T*(animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation )Tj
T*(undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes. )Tj

T*( It was against this backdrop that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. )Tj
T*(In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the )Tj
T*(company.[12] Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern )Tj
T*(marketing strategies to the industry.[13] He commissioned market research that )Tj
T*(identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their )Tj
T*(bras. Rather, they saw bras as a means to feel and look beautiful, to be )Tj
T*(fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went bra-less, )Tj
T*(they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian )Tj
T*(Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an )Tj
T*(essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors )Tj
T*(were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, )Tj
T*(Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.[14] )Tj
T*( Later, Larry Nadler identified an age based bifurcation in the market. Younger )Tj
T*(women \(aged 15 to 20\) regarded their bras as an enhancement to their sexuality )Tj
T*(but were not interested in a heavily structured garment.[15] Nadler learned )Tj
T*(that women wanted "less bra," not "no bra."[14] In 1974, they introduced a new )Tj
T*(line of brassieres for teens called Dici \(by Wonderbra\), and invented new hot )Tj
T*(fabric molding technologies to shape the cup.[16] These bras were seamless and )Tj
T*(simply designed with less support than the typical bra of the period. The )Tj
T*(company designed special packaging in the shape of a die \(with holes\).[17] )Tj
T*( [edit] Brand development )Tj
T*( In 1966, Canadian Lady made several important changes to their advertising )Tj
T*(strategy. They introduced television advertising and changed the emphasis from )Tj
T*(the product to the brand. Ads attempted to build consumer awareness of the )Tj
T*(single brand name: Wonderbra. Market research showed that women did not want )Tj
T*(girdles advertised on television‚Äîgirdles were seen as armor against sex, while )Tj
T*(bras provided a means of attraction.[18] )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Our Montreal office got the Wonderbra account. This was a Canadian company )Tj
T*(which held down the Number Two position in women's garmentwear. One of our )Tj
T*(copywriters came up with the line: "We care about the shape you're in." Larry )Tj
T*(Nadler, who headed the family business, was a risk-taker. He loved the line and )Tj
T*(so did we. We had it set to music and prepared a television campaign around it. )Tj
T*(The CBC turned it down, not because of the line, but because we had the )Tj
T*(audacity to show a woman in a bra. CTV had no such qualms, which proves how )Tj
T*(arbitrary the world can be. Eventually, the CBC recanted and ran the campaign. )Tj
T*(.... The result of the campaign‚Äînot just in TV, but other media as well‚Äîmoved )Tj
T*(Wonderbra into a solid, first-place position in its field.[19])Tj
T*(- Gerry Goodis, former CEO, Goodis Advertising)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Instead of being hidden "unmentionables", Wonderbras became more visible icons )Tj
T*(of female sex-appeal. The company also used pricing to promote Wonderbra as a )Tj
T*(luxury product with the highest price of any mass-merchandised brand. This )Tj
T*(strategy also provided greater profits in a very competitive industry. The goal )Tj
T*(was to have women see their Wonderbras as a cosmetic‚Äîa beauty enhancer‚Äîrather )Tj
T*(than a functional garment. Playtex, the leading brand at the time, promoted the )Tj
T*(ease of care and durability of their girdles and brassieres. )Tj
T*( Beginning in 1967, the advertising focused exclusively on Wonderbra brand )Tj
T*(brassieres.[18] In 1968, Nadler hired Goodis Advertising to develop the new )Tj
T*(campaign. The Wonderbra ads were based on fashion and emotional appeal. In )Tj
T*(various ads, the man would appear as fashion photographer \(in a fashion shoot\) )Tj
T*(or fashion buyer \(at a fashion show\).[21] The storyline suggested an attraction )Tj
T*(or budding romance between the man and the women. The voice-over and jingle )Tj
T*(featured a man's voice and the commercial showed an actual woman's torso naked )Tj
T*(except for a bra. All other television ads before this era showed brassieres on )Tj
T*(a manikin or a dressmaker's dummy to promote the functional features of the )Tj
T*(product. Every Wonderbra advertisement contained versions of the musical theme, )Tj
T*("We care about the shape you're in. Wonderful, wonderful, Wonderbra".[22] The )Tj
T*(1979 television campaign included a commercial directed by Richard Avedon which )Tj
T*(won a Silver award for television advertisements shown in Canada.[23] )Tj

T*( The Dici by Wonderbra television advertisements started in 1974.[24] The brand )Tj
T*(was positioned to young women as a more natural alternative to the )Tj
T*(heavily-structured bras worn by their mothers. The animated ads featured the )Tj
T*(iconic die-shaped packaging. A bra exited the box like a bird, then )Tj
T*(metamorphosed into a seagull and flew away. The tagline reinforced a spirit of )Tj
T*(freedom and nature: "Let it be Dici. Dici or nothing." )Tj
T*( [edit] Popularity in Canada )Tj
T*( From 1972 to 1977, the company doubled its wholesale revenue from $12.6 )Tj
T*(million to $24.9 million.[2] By 1979 Canadelle dominated with 30% of the )Tj
T*(Canadian market and $27 million in sales. Playtex \(later acquired by Sara Lee\) )Tj
T*(was second.[25] By 1980, Wonderbra's sales were over $30 million wholesale \($76 )Tj
T*(million in 2006 dollars\) in a country with only 10.3 million women and girls )Tj
T*(older than 13.[26] )Tj

T*(even I get cleavage with them."[27])Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( Around 1991, Gossard was selling the Wonderbra lines under licenses that were )Tj
T*(to expire in January 1994. At the time, the plunge style was a good seller in )Tj
T*(the UK market. Gossard planned to renew their license and had an option to do )Tj
T*(so under the existing agreement. Instead of simply renewing the agreement, )Tj
T*(Gossard executives decided to negotiate better terms with Sara Lee. )Tj
T*( Soon after the negotiations started, something unexpected happened. In 1992, )Tj
T*(the plunge style became a hit with British women and sales took off. Between )Tj
T*(1991 and 1993, UK sales of that Wonderbra style quadrupled to $28 million, )Tj
T*(accounting for 12.5% of the $225 million UK branded bra market. Several factors )Tj
T*(might have contributed to this boom including "an article in British Vogue on )Tj
T*(the return of the padded bra, a Vivienne Westwood-inspired fad for corsetry and )Tj
T*(that Gaultier driven yearning for underwear as outerwear".[3] With this surge )Tj
T*(in sales, Sara Lee decided not to renew the license with Gossard.[15] )Tj
T*( In 1994 in the UK, the \(Sara Lee\) Wonderbra achieved a high profile for its )Tj
T*(racy Hello Boys campaign. The most famous campaign poster presented model Eva )Tj
T*(Herzigov√° in a Wonderbra gazing down at her breasts with the caption "Hello )Tj
T*(Boys", ambiguously addressing either male admirers or her breasts.[28][29]Urban )Tj
T*(myth attributed a number of car accidents to \(male\) drivers being distracted by )Tj
T*(the advertisements.[30] The influential poster was featured in an exhibition at )Tj
T*(the Victoria and Albert Museum in London[31] and it was voted in at number 10 )Tj
T*(in a "Poster of the Century" contest.[32] )Tj
T*( The Playtex Division of Sara Lee was given the responsibility of introducing )Tj
T*("The Wonderbra" style to the United States. Although the model was already )Tj
T*(being manufactured in Montreal by Canadelle, Playtex executives decided to take )Tj
T*(a year to redesign the bra for the U.S. market. They scheduled a late 1994 )Tj
T*(national launch for the bra. During this period, Gossard introduced to )Tj
T*(Americans their Ultrabra, with a design similar to the push-up Wonderbra )Tj
T*(model.[3][27] Other competitors quickly followed while Playtex retooled the )Tj
T*(design. Victoria's Secret launched television advertisements to maintain )Tj
T*(visibility for the Miracle Bra which the company launched in 1993.[33] )Tj

T*( The 2007‚Äì2008 Nazko earthquakes were a series of small volcanic earthquakes )Tj
T*(measuring less than 4.0¬†on the Richter magnitude scale. They took place in the )Tj
T*(sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, )Tj
T*(Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred )Tj
T*(just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted )Tj
T*(about 7,200¬†years ago. )Tj
T*( No damage or casualties resulted from the Nazko earthquakes, which were too )Tj
T*(small to be felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them. The )Tj
T*(earthquake swarm occurred at the eastern end of a known volcanic zone called )Tj
T*(the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic )Tj
T*(formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British )Tj
T*(Columbia. )Tj
T*( [edit] Geology )Tj
T*( The 2007‚Äì2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is interpreted to have originated 25¬†km )Tj
T*(\(16¬†mi\) below the surface. The character of the seismic waves indicated that )Tj
T*(the swarm originated from a magmatic source. It could have formed as a result )Tj
T*(of rock fracturing at the tip of a dike and/or by movement along fault planes )Tj
T*(due to changes in the local stress field by the expansion and movement of )Tj
T*(magma.[1] This magmatic activity is potentially linked to the hypothesized )Tj
T*(Anahim hotspot, a mantle plume that is probably responsible for older volcanism )Tj
T*(throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt.[2] This volcanic belt includes the )Tj
T*(Rainbow, Ilgachuz and Itcha range shield volcanoes west of the Nazko swarm.[3] )Tj
T*(Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older to the west of the Nazko )Tj
T*(swarm, indicating that the North American Plate is moving in a westerly )Tj
T*(direction with respect to the hotspot, carrying the volcanoes along with it at )Tj
T*(a rate of 2¬†cm \(0.79¬†in\) to 3.3¬†cm \(33¬†mm\) per year.[4] Because the area where )Tj
T*(the 2007‚Äì2008 Nazko earthquake swarm originated is at the eastern end of the )Tj
T*(volcanic belt, it probably represents the youngest portion of the hotspot )Tj
T*(track. This suggests any future volcanic earthquakes will occur in the Nazko )Tj
T*(region or further to the east.[3] )Tj
T*( Before the Nazko earthquake swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot was not )Tj
T*(known to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of )Tj
T*(earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude )Tj
T*(1.0¬†on the Richter magnitude scale, but at least one earthquake was as strong )Tj
T*(as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources )Tj
T*(Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200¬†year old Nazko Cone.[5] )Tj
T*( Even though earthquake swarms can be dangerous, scientists are able to model )Tj
T*(such events to analyze their structure.[5] During the earthquake swarm in 2007, )Tj
T*(a group of scientists investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption )Tj
T*(would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, )Tj
T*(and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data )Tj
T*(were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the )Tj
T*(University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko )Tj
T*(earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near )Tj

T*(Nazko Cone.[6] However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko )Tj
T*(earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North )Tj
T*(America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic )Tj
T*(eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of )Tj
T*(California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of )Tj
T*(Oregon.[7] )Tj
T*( [edit] Number of earthquakes )Tj
T*( More than 1,000 earthquakes were recorded by regional seismic networks within )Tj
T*(three weeks of October 20, 2007. Because the seismometers that recorded the )Tj
T*(Nazko swarm were more than 25¬†km \(16¬†mi\) away from where the earthquakes took )Tj
T*(place, the locations of the hypocenters were measured with poor resolution. )Tj
T*(Following the earthquake, five seismometers were placed by the Geological )Tj
T*(Survey of Canada from September 2007 to June 2008 close to the hypocenter.[1] )Tj
T*(Analysis of the data recorded by these seismometers indicates a much larger )Tj
T*(total number of earthquakes. For example, at least 597¬†earthquakes were )Tj
T*(recognized during a period of only six hours.[7] )Tj
T*( At least two episodes of earthquakes constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first )Tj
T*(seismic phase from October 29 to November 1, 2007, a total of 153¬†earthquakes )Tj
T*(took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June )Tj
T*(12, 2008, 4,428¬†earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were )Tj
T*(cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes in the development of the )Tj
T*(earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings )Tj
T*(of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then )Tj
T*(decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later )Tj
T*(stages of the two events.[1] )Tj
T*( [edit] Scientific response )Tj
T*( The earthquake swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the Prince George )Tj
T*(Citizen by citizen staff, three days after the earthquakes began. Scientists )Tj
T*(mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources )Tj
T*(Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological )Tj
T*(Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not )Tj
T*(know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, "the depth is )Tj
T*(enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause )Tj
T*(is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain )Tj
T*(characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. )Tj
T*(And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes )Tj
T*(and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if )Tj
T*(they're migrating at all."[8] )Tj
T*( Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted )Tj
T*(it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur )Tj
T*(in subduction-zone volcanoes. "We're not talking about an injection of tonnes )Tj
T*(of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or )Tj
T*(the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, )Tj
T*(relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact...but it'll be )Tj
T*(extremely exciting," Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson )Tj
T*(suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of )Tj
T*(lava 100¬†m \(330¬†ft\) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in )Tj
T*(Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but )Tj
T*(warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be )Tj
T*(released during the event.[8] )Tj
T*( [edit] Preparedness and hazards )Tj
T*( Because no seismographs were close enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the )Tj
T*(earthquakes began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in )Tj
T*(the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound )Tj
T*(station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that )Tj
T*(would normally go unnoticed by human hearing.[7] These stations can detect )Tj
T*(volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in )Tj
T*(combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within )Tj
T*(volcanoes.[9] Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two )Tj
T*(communities that were adjacent to the 2007‚Äì2008 earthquake swarm to renew )Tj

T*(information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the )Tj
T*(more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural )Tj
T*(Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the )Tj
T*(earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in )Tj
T*(volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of )Tj
T*(this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic )Tj
T*(activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible )Tj
T*(discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.[7] )Tj
T*( The 2007‚Äì2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is one of numerous seismic events that )Tj
T*(have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have )Tj
T*(experienced volcanic earthquakes include Mount Meager \(seventeen events\), Mount )Tj
T*(Cayley \(four events\), Mount Garibaldi \(three events\), Silverthrone Caldera \(two )Tj
T*(events\), Castle Rock \(two events\), Hoodoo Mountain \(eight events\), Crow Lagoon )Tj
T*(\(four events\), The Volcano \(five events\), and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex )Tj
T*(\(eight events\).[10] Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain )Tj
T*(active magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity.[11] )Tj
T*(Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations )Tj
T*(are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant )Tj
T*(potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's )Tj
T*(most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes with a history of )Tj
T*(significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza )Tj
T*(volcanic complex.[10] )Tj
T*( If magma were to rise towards the surface of Nazko, new earthquake swarms )Tj
T*(would occur, with a significant increase in the size and number of earthquakes. )Tj
T*(An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, )Tj
T*(similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200¬†years ago. Immediate hazards related to )Tj
T*(cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if )Tj
T*(an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.[7] )Tj

T*( Fantastic Adventures was an American pulp science fiction magazine, published )Tj
T*(from 1939 to 1953 by Ziff-Davis. It was initially edited by Ray Palmer, who was )Tj
T*(also the editor of Amazing Stories, Ziff-Davis's other science fiction title. )Tj
T*(The first nine issues were in bedsheet format, but in June 1940 it switched to )Tj
T*(a standard pulp size. It was almost cancelled at the end of 1940, but the )Tj
T*(October 1940 issue had unexpectedly good sales, helped by a strong cover by J. )Tj
T*(Allen St. John for Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land. By May 1941 the )Tj
T*(magazine was on a regular monthly schedule. Historians of science fiction )Tj
T*(consider that Palmer was unable to maintain a consistently high standard of )Tj
T*(fiction, but Fantastic Adventures soon developed a reputation for light-hearted )Tj
T*(and whimsical stories. Much of the material was written by a small group of )Tj
T*(writers under both their own names and house names. The cover art, like those )Tj
T*(of many other pulps of the era, focused on beautiful women in melodramatic )Tj
T*(action scenes. One regular cover artist was H.W. McCauley, whose glamorous )Tj
T*("MacGirl" covers were popular with the readers, though the emphasis on )Tj
T*(depictions of attractive and often partly clothed women did draw some )Tj
T*(objections from readers. )Tj
T*( In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was replaced by Howard Browne, who was )Tj
T*(knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed to )Tj
T*(improve the quality of the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period )Tj
T*(around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest )Tj
T*(when his plan to take Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed, however, and the )Tj
T*(magazine fell back into predictability. In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another )Tj
T*(fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, and )Tj
T*(within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor )Tj
T*(of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last. )Tj
T*( [edit] Publication history )Tj
T*( Although science fiction \(sf\) had been published before the 1920s, it did not )Tj
T*(begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 )Tj
T*(of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By the end of )Tj
T*(the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom.[1] Gernsback lost control of )Tj
T*(Amazing Stories in 1929; it was sold to Teck Publications, and then in 1938 it )Tj
T*(was acquired by Ziff-Davis.[2][3] The following year Ziff-Davis launched )Tj
T*(Fantastic Adventures as a companion to Amazing; the first issue was dated May )Tj
T*(1939, and the editor of Amazing, Ray Palmer, took on responsibility for the new )Tj
T*(magazine as well.[4] )Tj
T*( Fantastic Adventures was initially published in bedsheet format,[note 1] the )Tj
T*(same size as the early sf magazines such as Amazing,[6][7] perhaps in order to )Tj
T*(attract fans who were nostalgic for the larger format.[8] It started as a )Tj
T*(bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than )Tj
T*(for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to )Tj
T*(bimonthly again. The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format, since )Tj
T*(that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to )Tj
T*(make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' )Tj
T*(Jongor of Lost Land, and had an attractive cover by J. Allen St. John; the )Tj
T*(combination proved to be so popular that October sales were twice the August )Tj
T*(figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was )Tj
T*(restarted in January 1941‚Äîas a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly )Tj
T*(again in May of that year.[4][8] )Tj
T*( Howard Browne took over as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic )Tj
T*(Adventures in 1950. Browne preferred fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed )Tj
T*(editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket )Tj
T*(were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines for a )Tj
T*(while.[9][10] He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and )Tj

T*(the quality declined. At the end of 1950 Ziff-Davis moved its offices from )Tj
T*(Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay )Tj
T*(in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such )Tj
T*(as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result to have been a definite )Tj
T*(improvement in quality.[7][9] Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a )Tj
T*(new digest-sized magazine Fantastic in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate )Tj
T*(success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as )Tj
T*(well. The move away from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the )Tj
T*(early 1950s, and with Fantastic's success there was little reason to keep )Tj
T*(Fantastic Adventures going. It was merged with Fantastic; the last issue was )Tj
T*(dated March 1953, and the May‚ÄìJune issue of Fantastic added a mention of )Tj
T*(Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the )Tj
T*(following issue.[10] )Tj
T*( [edit] Contents and reception )Tj
T*( [edit] Palmer )Tj
T*( Palmer's goal for Fantastic Adventures was to create a magazine which )Tj
T*(published fantasy fiction but was the literary equal of the quality )Tj
T*(magazines‚Äîthe "slicks", such as The Saturday Evening Post.[4] Although mixing )Tj
T*(science fiction with fantasy was not popular with sf fans of the era, Palmer )Tj
T*(consciously promoted the magazine as containing the best of both worlds: the )Tj
T*(slogan on the cover read "The Best in Science Fiction", but Palmer also wrote )Tj
T*(blurbs in Amazing Stories for Fantastic Adventures in which he extolled the )Tj
T*(value to a reader of getting both genres in a single magazine.[8]Fantastic )Tj
T*(Adventures' competition included Unknown, which had been launched just a couple )Tj
T*(of months earlier, in March 1939, and Weird Tales, which was first published in )Tj
T*(1923; but instead of attempting to emulate either one, Fantastic Adventures )Tj
T*(focused on adventure stories in the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Palmer )Tj
T*(probably acquired some fantasy-oriented material that had been submitted to )Tj
T*(Amazing Stories, which gave him an immediate stream of submissions to work )Tj
T*(with.[4] However, according to Ashley the first issue was quite weak: the cover )Tj
T*(story was "The Invisible Robinhood" by Eando Binder, and other contributors )Tj
T*(included Harl Vincent, Ross Rocklynne and A. Hyatt Verrill.[4][11] Features )Tj
T*(included a quiz, an author profile, and a comic strip, titled "Ray Holmes, )Tj
T*(Scientific Detective"; the reader was supposed to solve the mystery based on )Tj
T*(the clues given in the strip. It was a failure and disappeared after the first )Tj
T*(issue.[8] The back cover, "The Man from Mars", by Frank R. Paul, was more )Tj
T*(successful,[4] and illustrated back covers became a regular feature of the )Tj
T*(magazine.[8] )Tj
T*( The next issue contained "The Scientists' Revolt", by Edgar Rice Burroughs, a )Tj
T*(name guaranteed to help sales. Ashley comments that the story was unimpressive; )Tj
T*(it had been written as a palace intrigue set in contemporary Europe, but )Tj
T*(Burroughs had been unable to find a buyer. Palmer eventually acquired it, and )Tj
T*(rewrote it, setting it in the future. Despite the weakness of the lead story, )Tj
T*(the second issue was a marked improvement over the first, with well-received )Tj
T*(stories by Nelson S. Bond and John Russell Fearn \(as "Thornton Ayre"\).[8] )Tj
T*(Burroughs returned to Fantastic Adventures in 1941, with a series of novelettes )Tj
T*(in his Carson of Venus series; there were four in all between March 1941 and )Tj
T*(March 1942, each with cover art by J. Allen St. John, and the result was a )Tj
T*(significant boost to Fantastic Adventures' circulation.[8] )Tj
T*( A majority of the stories in Fantastic Adventures came from a small group of )Tj
T*(writers who often wrote under house names. The main members of the group were )Tj
T*(William P. McGivern, David Wright O'Brien, Don Wilcox, Chester S. Geier, Rog )Tj
T*(Phillips, Leroy Yerxa, Robert Moore Williams, Robert Bloch and Berkeley )Tj
T*(Livingston.[8][12] Most of this material was of little lasting value, in )Tj
T*(Ashley's opinion, but Palmer was often able to get good stories from outside )Tj
T*(this group: August Derleth sold several stories to Palmer, for example. Ray )Tj
T*(Bradbury also sold a story to Fantastic Adventures‚Äî"Tomorrow and Tomorrow", )Tj
T*(which appeared in 1947, was his only appearance in the magazine, but Ashley )Tj
T*(regards it as "among the best stories [Fantastic Adventures] published in the )Tj
T*(1940s".[8] An early contributor was Nelson S. Bond, whose story "The Judging of )Tj

T*(the Priestess" appeared in the April 1940 issue. This was the second in a )Tj
T*(highly regarded series of three stories about a priestess in the future, after )Tj
T*(civilization has collapsed; the first and third in the series appeared in )Tj
T*(Amazing Stories and Astounding Stories respectively.[4] Bond also wrote a )Tj
T*(humorous short story called "The Amazing Invention of Wilberforce Weems", which )Tj
T*(appeared in the September 1939 issue and described the consequences of a potion )Tj
T*(that allowed the instant absorption of knowledge from any book. Palmer )Tj
T*(encouraged his stable of writers to follow up with more whimsical ideas, and )Tj
T*(the resulting offbeat stories gave Fantastic Adventures a reputation for )Tj
T*(light-hearted and entertaining fantasy.[4] These stories often had absurd )Tj
T*(names; early examples include "The Quandary of Quantus Quaggle", "Sidney, the )Tj
T*(Screwloose Robot" \(both by McGivern\), and "The Weird Doom of Floyd Scrilch", by )Tj
T*(Robert Bloch‚Äîone of his series of stories about Lefty Feep, almost all of which )Tj
T*(appeared in Fantastic Adventures between 1942 and 1945.[4] Robert Moore )Tj
T*(Williams contributed two sequels to his successful Jongor of Lost Land: The )Tj
T*(Return of Jongor appeared in 1944, and Jongor Fights Back in 1951.[8] )Tj
T*( Palmer enjoyed hoaxes, such as printing a photograph of a writer when in fact )Tj
T*(the name in question was a pseudonym. In the February 1944 issue of Fantastic )Tj
T*(Adventures he printed a letter in which the writer claimed to be a )Tj
T*(time-traveling scientist born in 1970, whose time machine was inspired by a )Tj
T*(story in the magazine. Palmer pretended to take it seriously, and printed an )Tj
T*(appeal to readers to find the scientist.[13] Palmer's most successful hoax was )Tj
T*(the "Shaver Mystery", a series of stories in which the author, Richard Shaver, )Tj
T*(explained all the wrecks and accidents on Earth as the result of interference )Tj
T*(by ancient machinery hidden underground. The series was enormously popular; all )Tj
T*(the Shaver Mystery stories were published in Fantastic Adventures' companion )Tj
T*(magazine, Amazing Stories \(which led Ashley to describe Fantastic Adventures as )Tj
T*(a "haven" from the Shaver stories\) but Shaver did also publish some competent )Tj
T*(fantasies in Fantastic Adventures.[8][13][14] The increased circulation enabled )Tj
T*(both Amazing and Fantastic Adventures to return to monthly publication in the )Tj
T*(late 1940s.[15] )Tj
T*( [edit] Browne )Tj
T*( When Browne took over at the start of 1950, William Hamling was doing most of )Tj
T*(the editorial work. Browne did not fully take control of the magazine until the )Tj
T*(end of the year, when Hamling and Palmer both left Ziff-Davis; the quality of )Tj
T*(the fiction promptly improved at that point, and the first year or two of )Tj
T*(Browne's tenure are regarded as the high point of Fantastic Adventures' )Tj
T*(run.[7][8]Theodore Sturgeon's novel The Dreaming Jewels appeared in February )Tj
T*(1950, and Lester del Rey, William Tenn and Walter M. Miller all published )Tj
T*(notable material.[7] In April 1950, Mack Reynolds' first story, "Isolationist", )Tj
T*(appeared in Fantastic Adventures. Reynolds became more strongly associated with )Tj
T*(Astounding Science Fiction than with the Ziff-Davis magazines, but some of the )Tj
T*(radical political themes of his later work are evident in "Isolationist". The )Tj
T*(story describes helpful alien visitors abandoning Earth to atomic war because )Tj
T*(of the hostility of the first Earthman they encounter.[17]John Jakes also )Tj
T*(debuted in Fantastic Adventures that year, with "The Dreaming Trees", in )Tj
T*(November 1950.[8] )Tj
T*( Overall the quality was low, but according to sf historian Brian Stableford, )Tj
T*("sf writers given carte blanche to write pure fantasy for [Fantastic )Tj
T*(Adventures] did often produce readable fiction with a distinctive whimsical and )Tj
T*(ironic flavour".[7] Critic John Clute's assessment was that it was )Tj
T*(inconsistent, "but there were some terrific tales in it. Not enough, but )Tj
T*(some."[18] Notable stories from the post-war era include Theodore Sturgeon's )Tj
T*("Largo" and Raymond F. Jones' "The Children's Room". The artwork was generally )Tj
T*(of higher quality than the stories; Ashley describes Fantastic Adventures as )Tj
T*("one of the best-illustrated magazines around". Regular artists included Virgil )Tj
T*(Finlay, Henry Sharp, Rod Ruth, and Malcolm Smith.[8] In Palmer's words, "It has )Tj
T*(been our experience that covers sell magazines‚Äîsimply because they attract )Tj
T*(attention."[8] For the first year the cover art, while dramatic, was more )Tj
T*(likely to show an action scene with a male hero than a damsel in distress, but )Tj

T*( Fantastic was initially bedsheet-sized and had a page count of 96, which )Tj

T*(to 25 cents, where it remained for the rest of the magazine's run, and the page )Tj
T*(count went up again to 240. From June 1943 to July 1945 there were 208 pages, )Tj
T*(and the count dropped to 176 with the October 1945 issue; then to 160 in July )Tj

T*(156. It dropped again to 144 with the June 1949 issue, but rose to 160 from )Tj
T*(September 1949 to August 1950. The September 1950 issue had 148 pages, and all )Tj
T*(the remaining issues had 130 pages.[8] )Tj
T*( The magazine began as a bimonthly, but switched to a monthly schedule in )Tj
T*(January 1940, though this only lasted six issues. June 1940 was followed by )Tj
T*(August and October 1940 and January and March 1941. The May 1941 issue )Tj
T*(inaugurated another monthly period that lasted until August 1943, when the )Tj
T*(schedule switched back to bimonthly until the June 1944 issue. Fantastic then )Tj
T*(went on a quarterly schedule, beginning with the October 1944 issue; in October )Tj
T*(1945 it became bimonthly again, though there was a gap between February and May )Tj
T*(1946. From September 1947 to the end of the run the magazine was monthly. The )Tj
T*(volume numeration was regular, with a new volume starting at the beginning of )Tj
T*(each calendar year; the result was a variable number of issues in each volume, )Tj
T*(from a low of four in 1944 to a full 12 when the magazine was monthly, as it )Tj
T*(was for the last few years of its life. The last issue was volume 15 number )Tj
T*(3.[8] )Tj
T*( There were two British reprint editions. The first consisted of two numbered )Tj

T*(London. This was pulp-sized and 32 pages long; it contained stories from the )Tj
T*(wartime U.S. edition. The second series was published by Thorpe &amp; Porter, )Tj
T*(in Leicester, and consisted of 24 undated issues, all but the first two of )Tj

T*( A B movie is a low-budget commercial motion picture that is not definitively )Tj
T*(an arthouse or pornographic film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age )Tj
T*(of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified a film intended for )Tj
T*(distribution as the less-publicized, bottom half of a double feature. Although )Tj
T*(the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the )Tj
T*(end of the 1950s, the term B movie continued to be used in the broader sense it )Tj
T*(maintains today. In its post‚ÄìGolden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides )Tj
T*(of the definition: on the one hand, many B movies display a high degree of )Tj
T*(craft and aesthetic ingenuity; on the other, the primary interest of many )Tj

T*( In either usage, most B movies represent a particular genre‚Äîthe Western was a )Tj

T*(less common. As the average running time of top-of-the-line films increased, so )Tj
T*(did that of B pictures. In its current usage, the term has somewhat )Tj
T*(contradictory connotations: it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is )Tj
T*(\(a\) a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or \(b\) a lively, energetic )Tj
T*(film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and )Tj
T*(unburdened by the conventions of putatively "serious" independent film. The )Tj
T*(term is also now used loosely to refer to some higher budgeted, mainstream )Tj
T*(films with exploitation-style content, usually in genres traditionally )Tj
T*(associated with the B movie. )Tj
T*( From their beginnings to the present day, B movies have provided opportunities )Tj
T*(both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning. )Tj
T*(Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their )Tj
T*(craft in B movies. They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson )Tj
T*(first became established, and they have provided work for former A movie )Tj
T*(actors, such as Vincent Price and Karen Black. Some actors, such as B√©la Lugosi )Tj
T*(and Pam Grier, worked in B movies for most of their careers. The term B actor )Tj
T*(is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or )Tj
T*(exclusively in B pictures. )Tj
T*( [edit] History )Tj
T*( [edit] Roots of the B movie: 1920s )Tj
T*( It is not clear that the term B movie \(or B film or B picture\) was in general )Tj
T*(use before the 1930s, but a similar concept was already well established. In )Tj
T*(1927‚Äì28, at the end of the silent era, the production cost of an average )Tj
T*(feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from $190,000 at Fox to $275,000 )Tj
T*(at MGM. That average reflected both "specials" that might cost as much as $1 )Tj
T*(million and films made quickly for around $50,000. These cheaper films allowed )Tj
T*(the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in )Tj
T*(between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new )Tj
T*(personnel.[2] Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as Columbia )Tj
T*(Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America \(FBO\), focused on exactly those )Tj
T*(sort of cheap productions. Their movies, with relatively short running times, )Tj
T*(targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs, )Tj
T*(particularly small-town and urban neighborhood venues, or "nabes". Even smaller )Tj
T*(production houses, known as Poverty Row studios, made films whose costs might )Tj
T*(run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could )Tj
T*(pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.[3] )Tj
T*( With the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many )Tj
T*(independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, )Tj
T*(which involved live acts and a broad variety of shorts before a single featured )Tj
T*(film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard )Tj
T*(practice: a newsreel, a short and/or a serial, and a cartoon, followed by a )Tj
T*(double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main )Tj
T*(event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in )Tj
T*(shorts. The majors' "clearance" rules favoring their affiliated theaters )Tj
T*(prevented the independents' timely access to top-quality films; the second )Tj
T*(feature allowed them to promote quantity instead.[4] The additional movie also )Tj
T*(gave the program "balance"‚Äîthe practice of pairing different sorts of features )Tj
T*(suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest )Tj
T*(no matter what specifically was on the bill. The low-budget picture of the )Tj
T*(1920s thus evolved into the second feature, the B movie, of Hollywood's Golden )Tj
T*(Age.[5] )Tj
T*( [edit] Bs in the Golden Age of Hollywood: 1930s )Tj
T*( The major studios, at first resistant to the double feature, soon adapted. All )Tj
T*(established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. )Tj
T*(Block booking became standard practice: to get access to a studio's attractive )Tj
T*(A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for )Tj
T*(a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee \(rather than the box office )Tj
T*(percentage basis of A films\), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the )Tj
T*(profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely )Tj

T*( Poverty Row studios, from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures, Tiffany )Tj
T*(Pictures, and Sono Art-World Wide Pictures down to shoestring operations, made )Tj
T*(exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts, and also distributed totally )Tj
T*(independent productions and imported films. In no position to directly block )Tj
T*(book, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to "states rights" )Tj
T*(firms, which in turn peddled blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or )Tj
T*(more pictures featuring the same star \(a relative status on Poverty Row\).[7] )Tj
T*(Two "major-minors"‚ÄîUniversal Studios and rising Columbia Pictures‚Äîhad )Tj
T*(production lines roughly similar to, though somewhat better endowed than, the )Tj
T*(top Poverty Row studios. In contrast to the Big Five majors, Universal and )Tj
T*(Columbia had few or no theaters, though they did have top-rank film )Tj
T*(distribution exchanges.[8] )Tj
T*( In the standard Golden Age model, the industry's top product, the A films, )Tj
T*(premiered at a small number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double )Tj
T*(features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by )Tj
T*(historian Edward Jay Epstein, "During these first runs, films got their )Tj
T*(reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the )Tj
T*(principal form of advertising."[9] Then it was off to the subsequent-run market )Tj
T*(where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by )Tj
T*(the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of )Tj
T*(smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed two or three times a )Tj
T*(week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row )Tj
T*(turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes )Tj
T*(long; these were known as "quickies" for their tight production schedules‚Äîas )Tj
T*(short as four days.[10] As Brian Taves describes, "Many of the poorest )Tj
T*(theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a )Tj
T*(continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes )Tj
T*(offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed )Tj
T*(daily."[11] Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their )Tj
T*(movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty )Tj
T*(Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of )Tj
T*(course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that )Tj
T*(presaged its arrival, "[t]he new film's title on the marquee and the listings )Tj
T*(for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", )Tj
T*(writes Epstein.[12] Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be )Tj
T*(advertised at all. )Tj
T*( The introduction of sound had driven costs higher: by 1930, the average U.S. )Tj
T*(feature film cost $375,000 to produce.[13] A broad range of motion pictures )Tj
T*(occupied the B category. The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B )Tj
T*(films, but also movies classifiable as "programmers" \(also known as )Tj
T*("in-betweeners" or "intermediates"\). As Taves describes, "Depending on the )Tj
T*(prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer )Tj
T*(could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee."[14] On Poverty Row, many Bs )Tj
T*(were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major's A )Tj
T*(film, with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $5,000.[10] By )Tj
T*(the mid-1930s, the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model, and )Tj
T*(the majors responded. In 1935, B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised )Tj
T*(from 12 to 50 percent of studio output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known )Tj
T*(as the "Keeper of the Bs."[15] At Fox, which also shifted half of its )Tj
T*(production line into B territory, Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of )Tj
T*(more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.[16] )Tj
T*( A number of the top Poverty Row firms consolidated: Sono Art joined another )Tj
T*(company to create Monogram Pictures early in the decade. In 1935, Monogram, )Tj
T*(Mascot, and several smaller studios merged to establish Republic Pictures. The )Tj
T*(former heads of Monogram soon sold off their Republic shares and set up a new )Tj

T*(outside the studio system, profited from an outrageous concept: a Western with )Tj
T*(an all-midget cast, The Terror of Tiny Town \(1938\) was such a success in its )Tj
T*(independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.[25] )Tj
T*( Series of various genres, featuring recurrent, title-worthy characters or name )Tj
T*(actors in familiar roles, were particularly popular during the first decade of )Tj
T*(sound film. Fox's many B series, for instance, included Charlie Chan mysteries, )Tj
T*(Ritz Brothers comedies, and musicals with child star Jane Withers.[26] These )Tj
T*(series films are not to be confused with the short, cliffhanger-structured )Tj
T*(serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, )Tj
T*(many series were intended to attract young people‚Äîa theater that twin-billed )Tj
T*(part-time might run a "balanced" or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a )Tj
T*(matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the )Tj
T*(words of one industry report, afternoon moviegoers, "composed largely of )Tj
T*(housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds )Tj
T*(want 'something good and not too much of it.'"[27] Series films are often )Tj
T*(unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category, but even here there is )Tj
T*(ambiguity: at MGM, for example, popular series like the Andy Hardy chronicles )Tj
T*(had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at some of the )Tj
T*(lesser majors.[28] For many series, even a lesser major's standard B budget was )Tj
T*(far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan, the )Tj
T*(Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.[29] )Tj
T*( [edit] Bs in the Golden Age of Hollywood: 1940s )Tj
T*( By 1940, the average production cost of an American feature was $400,000, a )Tj
T*(negligible increase over ten years.[13] A number of small Hollywood companies )Tj
T*(had folded around the turn of the decade, including the ambitious Grand )Tj
T*(National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation \(PRC\), emerged as )Tj
T*(third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double )Tj
T*(feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, )Tj
T*(50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, and others employed the )Tj
T*(policy part-time.[30] In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to )Tj
T*(replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five )Tj
T*(pictures. Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind )Tj
T*(bidding.[31] These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the )Tj
T*(Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more )Tj
T*(important as B movie suppliers. Genre pictures made at very low cost remained )Tj
T*(the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely )Tj
T*(climbing over $200,000. Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight )Tj
T*(majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, now commanded about 95 )Tj
T*(percent of U.S. and Canadian box office receipts.[32] In 1946, independent )Tj
T*(producer David O. Selznick brought his bloated-budget spectacle Duel in the Sun )Tj
T*(to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release. The distribution )Tj
T*(strategy was a major success, despite what was widely perceived as the movie's )Tj
T*(poor quality.[33] The Duel release anticipated practices that fueled the B )Tj
T*(movie industry in the late 1950s; when the top Hollywood studios made them )Tj
T*(standard two decades after that, the B movie would be hard hit.[34] )Tj
T*( Considerations beside cost made the line between A and B movies ambiguous. )Tj
T*(Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or )Tj
T*(emerged as sleeper hits: One of 1943's biggest films was Hitler's Children, an )Tj
T*(RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than $3 million )Tj
T*(in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross box office )Tj
T*(receipts.[35] Particularly in the realm of film noir, A pictures sometimes )Tj
T*(echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Programmers, with )Tj
T*(their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition. As late as 1948, )Tj
T*(the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode‚Äîit was standard policy at )Tj
T*(25 percent of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36 percent.[36] The )Tj
T*(leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope: In 1947, Monogram )Tj

T*(production chief.[38] )Tj
T*( In the 1940s, RKO stood out among the industry's Big Five for its focus on B )Tj
T*(pictures.[40] From a latter-day perspective, the most famous of the major )Tj
T*(studios' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO. Lewton produced )Tj
T*(such moody, mysterious films as Cat People \(1942\), I Walked with a Zombie )Tj
T*(\(1943\), and The Body Snatcher \(1945\), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert )Tj

T*(entirely in retrospect.[41] The movie now widely described as the first classic )Tj
T*(film noir‚ÄîStranger on the Third Floor \(1940\), a 64-minute B‚Äîwas produced at )Tj
T*(RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly )Tj
T*(stylish vein.[42] The other major studios also turned out a considerable number )Tj
T*(of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the )Tj
T*(best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures in the mode )Tj
T*(were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the )Tj
T*(bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally )Tj
T*(dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of )Tj
T*(Hollywood's Golden Age.[43] )Tj
T*( In one sample year, 1947, RKO produced along with several noir programmers and )Tj
T*(A pictures, two straight B noirs: Desperate and The Devil Thumbs a Ride.[44] )Tj
T*(Ten B noirs that year came from Poverty Row's big three‚ÄîRepublic, Monogram, and )Tj
T*(PRC/Eagle-Lion‚Äîand one came from tiny Screen Guild. Three majors beside RKO )Tj
T*(contributed a total of five more. Along with these eighteen unambiguous B )Tj
T*(noirs, an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood.[45] )Tj
T*(Still, most of the majors' low-budget production remained the sort now largely )Tj
T*(ignored. RKO's representative output included the Mexican Spitfire and Lum and )Tj
T*(Abner comedy series, thrillers featuring the Saint and the Falcon, Westerns )Tj
T*(starring Tim Holt, and Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. Jean Hersholt )Tj
T*(played Dr. Christian in six films between 1939 and 1941.[46]The Courageous Dr. )Tj
T*(Christian \(1940\) was a standard entry: "In the course of an hour or so of )Tj
T*(screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal )Tj
T*(meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example )Tj
T*(for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid."[47] )Tj
T*( Down in Poverty Row, low budgets led to less palliative fare. Republic aspired )Tj
T*(to major-league respectability while making many cheap and modestly budgeted )Tj
T*(Westerns, but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with )Tj
T*(Monogram "exploitation pictures" like juvenile delinquency expos√© Where Are )Tj
T*(Your Children? \(1943\) and the prison film Women in Bondage \(1943\).[48] In 1947, )Tj
T*(PRC's The Devil on Wheels brought together teenagers, hot rods, and death. The )Tj
T*(little studio had its own house auteur: with his own crew and relatively free )Tj
T*(rein, director Edgar G. Ulmer was known as "the Capra of PRC".[49] Ulmer made )Tj
T*(films of every generic stripe: His Girls in Chains was released in May 1943, )Tj
T*(six months before Women in Bondage; by the end of the year, Ulmer had also made )Tj
T*(the teen-themed musical Jive Junction as well as Isle of Forgotten Sins, a )Tj
T*(South Seas adventure set around a brothel.[50] )Tj
T*( [edit] Transition I/The B movie in the television age: 1950s )Tj
T*( In 1948, a Supreme Court ruling in a federal antitrust suit against the majors )Tj
T*(outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains. )Tj
T*(With audiences draining away to television and studios scaling back production )Tj

T*(during the 1950s. The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling, )Tj
T*(offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of )Tj

T*(was out of the filmmaking business by decade's end. In other genres, Universal )Tj

T*(longer‚Äîthe top ten box-office releases of 1940 had averaged 112.5 minutes; the )Tj
T*(average length of 1955's top ten was 123.4.[54] In their modest way, the Bs )Tj
T*(were following suit. The age of the hour-long feature film was past; 70 minutes )Tj
T*(was now roughly the minimum. While the Golden Age‚Äìstyle second feature was )Tj
T*(dying, B movie was still used to refer to any low-budget genre film featuring )Tj
T*(relatively unheralded performers \(sometimes referred to as B actors\). The term )Tj
T*(retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots, )Tj
T*("stock" character types, and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy.[55] )Tj
T*(At the same time, the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile )Tj
T*(territory for experimentation, both serious and outlandish. )Tj
T*( Ida Lupino, well known as an actress, established herself as Hollywood's sole )Tj
T*(female director of the era.[56] In short, low-budget pictures made for her )Tj
T*(production company, The Filmakers, Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects )Tj
T*(such as rape in 1950's Outrage and 1953's self-explanatory The Bigamist.[57] )Tj
T*(Her most famous directorial effort, The Hitch-Hiker, a 1953 RKO release, is the )Tj
T*(only example of film noir's classic period directed by a woman.[58] That year, )Tj
T*(RKO put out another historically notable film made at low cost: Split Second, )Tj
T*(which concludes in a nuclear test range, is perhaps the first "atomic )Tj
T*(noir".[59] The most famous such movie, the independently produced Kiss Me )Tj
T*(Deadly \(1955\), typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and )Tj
T*(B picture, as Richard Maltby describes: a "programmer capable of occupying )Tj
T*(either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill, [it was] budgeted at )Tj
T*(approximately $400,000. [Its] distributor, United Artists, released around )Tj
T*(twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 )Tj
T*(in 1955."[60] The film's length, 106 minutes, is A level, but its star, Ralph )Tj
T*(Meeker, had previously appeared in only one major film. Its source is pure )Tj
T*(pulp, one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels, but Robert Aldrich's )Tj
T*(direction is self-consciously aestheticized. The result is a brutal genre )Tj
T*(picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of )Tj
T*(simply as the Bomb.[61] )Tj
T*( The fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, along with less expressible )Tj
T*(qualms about radioactive fallout from America's own atomic tests, energized )Tj
T*(many of the era's genre films. Science fiction, horror, and various hybrids of )Tj
T*(the two were now of central economic importance to the low-budget end of the )Tj
T*(business. Most down-market films of the type‚Äîlike many of those produced by )Tj
T*(William Alland at Universal \(e.g., Creature from the Black Lagoon [1954]\) and )Tj
T*(Sam Katzman at Columbia \(e.g., It Came from Beneath the Sea [1955]\)‚Äîprovided )Tj
T*(little more than thrills, though their special effects could be impressive.[63] )Tj
T*(But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for )Tj
T*(mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies. )Tj
T*(Director Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers \(1956\), released by Allied )Tj
T*(Artists, treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting, )Tj
T*(allegorical fashion.[64]The Amazing Colossal Man \(1957\), directed by Bert I. )Tj

T*(Doren.[69] )Tj
T*( In 1954, a young filmmaker named Roger Corman received his first screen )Tj
T*(credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' Highway Dragnet. )Tj
T*(Corman soon independently produced his first movie, Monster from the Ocean )Tj
T*(Floor, on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule.[70] Among the six )Tj
T*(films he worked on in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC )Tj
T*(release, Apache Woman, and Day the World Ended, half of Arkoff and Nicholson's )Tj
T*(first twin-bill package. Corman would go on to direct over fifty feature films )Tj
T*(through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 )Tj
T*(movies to his credit. Often referred to as the "King of the Bs", Corman has )Tj
T*(said that "to my way of thinking, I never made a 'B' movie in my life", as the )Tj
T*(traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to )Tj
T*(describe his metier as "low-budget exploitation films".[71] In later years )Tj
T*(Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the )Tj
T*(careers of Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Robert Towne, and Robert De )Tj
T*(Niro, among many others.[72] )Tj
T*( In the late 1950s, William Castle became known as the great innovator of the B )Tj
T*(movie publicity gimmick. Audiences of Macabre \(1958\), an $86,000 production )Tj
T*(distributed by Allied Artists, were invited to take out insurance policies to )Tj
T*(cover potential death from fright. The 1959 creature feature The Tingler )Tj
T*(featured Castle's most famous gimmick, Percepto: at the film's climax, buzzers )Tj
T*(attached to select theater seats would unexpectedly rattle a few audience )Tj
T*(members, prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate )Tj
T*(laughter.[73] With such films, Castle "combine[d] the saturation advertising )Tj
T*(campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William )Tj
T*(Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks )Tj
T*(that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor."[74] )Tj
T*( The postwar drive-in theater boom was vital to the expanding independent B )Tj
T*(movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; )Tj
T*(a decade later, there were more than 3,700.[75] Unpretentious pictures with )Tj
T*(simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for )Tj
T*(auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of )Tj
T*(the drive-in movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular )Tj
T*(culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began )Tj
T*(showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the )Tj
T*(midnight movie.[76] )Tj
T*( Increasingly, American-made genre films were joined by foreign movies acquired )Tj
T*(at low cost and, where necessary, dubbed for the U.S. market. In 1956, )Tj
T*(distributor Joseph E. Levine financed the shooting of new footage with American )Tj
T*(actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film )Tj
T*(Godzilla.[77] The British Hammer Film Productions made the successful The Curse )Tj

T*(than yawns in the film market¬†... had it not been [launched] throughout the )Tj
T*(country with a deafening barrage of publicity."[79] Levine counted on )Tj
T*(first-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film "into as many )Tj
T*(cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor )Tj
T*(word-of-mouth withdrew it for him."[80]Hercules opened at a remarkable 600 )Tj
T*(theaters, and the strategy was a smashing success: the film earned $4.7 million )Tj
T*(in domestic rentals. Just as valuable to the bottom line, it was even more )Tj
T*(successful overseas.[78] Within a few decades, Hollywood would be dominated by )Tj
T*(both movies and an exploitation philosophy very like Levine's. )Tj
T*( [edit] Golden age of exploitation: 1960s )Tj
T*( Despite all the transformations in the industry, by 1961 the average )Tj
T*(production cost of an American feature film was still only $2 million‚Äîafter )Tj
T*(adjusting for inflation, less than 10 percent more than it had been in )Tj
T*(1950.[13] The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a )Tj
T*(subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The )Tj
T*(AIP-style dual genre package was the new model. In July 1960, the latest Joseph )Tj
T*(E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood )Tj
T*(theaters in New York. A suspense film, Terror Is a Man, ran as a "co-feature" )Tj
T*(with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: "The d√©nouement helpfully )Tj
T*(includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'"[81] That )Tj
T*(year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: "When they asked me to make two )Tj
T*(ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced )Tj
T*(them instead to finance one horror film in color."[82] The resulting House of )Tj
T*(Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of B picture classification. It was )Tj
T*(clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the )Tj
T*(longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is )Tj
T*(generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the )Tj
T*(budget just $200,000 \(one-tenth the industry average\),[83] and its 85-minute )Tj
T*(running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: "Any movie that )Tj
T*(runs less than 80 minutes."[84] )Tj
T*( With the loosening of industry censorship constraints, the 1960s saw a major )Tj
T*(expansion in the commercial viability of a variety of B movie subgenres that )Tj
T*(became known collectively as exploitation films. The combination of intensive )Tj
T*(and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter and )Tj
T*(often outrageous imagery dated back decades‚Äîthe term had originally defined )Tj
T*(truly fringe productions, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely )Tj
T*(outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the )Tj
T*(context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly "sexual hygiene". )Tj
T*(Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual )Tj
T*(circumcision.[85] Such films were not generally booked as part of movie )Tj
T*(theaters' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling )Tj
T*(roadshow promoters \(they might also appear as fodder for "grindhouses", which )Tj
T*(typically had no regular schedule at all\). The most famous of those promoters, )Tj
T*(Kroger Babb, was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic )Tj
T*(films with a "100% saturation campaign", inundating the target audience with )Tj
T*(ads in almost any imaginable medium.[86] In the era of the traditional double )Tj
T*(feature, no one would have characterized these graphic exploitation films as "B )Tj
T*(movies". With the majors having exited traditional B production and )Tj
T*(exploitation-style promotion becoming standard practice at the lower end of the )Tj
T*(industry, "exploitation" became a way to refer to the entire field of )Tj

T*(1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters devoted themselves specifically )Tj
T*(to "adult" product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with greater attention )Tj
T*(to plot. Best known was Russ Meyer, who released his first successful narrative )Tj
T*(nudie, the comic Immoral Mr. Teas, in 1959. Five years later, Meyer came out )Tj
T*(with his breakthrough film, Lorna, which combined sex, violence, and a dramatic )Tj
T*(storyline.[90]Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! \(1965\), made for about $45,000, )Tj
T*(would ultimately become the most famous of Meyer's so-called sexploitation )Tj
T*(pictures. Crafted for constant titillation but containing no nudity, it was )Tj
T*(aimed at the same "passion pit" drive-in circuit that screened AIP teen movies )Tj
T*(with wink-wink titles like Beach Blanket Bingo \(1965\) and How to Stuff a Wild )Tj
T*(Bikini \(1966\), starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon.[91] Roger )Tj
T*(Corman's The Trip \(1967\) for American International, written by veteran )Tj
T*(AIP/Corman actor Jack Nicholson, never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, )Tj
T*(but flirts with nudity throughout.[92] The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing )Tj
T*(closer. )Tj
T*( One of the most influential films of the era, on Bs and beyond, was )Tj
T*(Paramount's Psycho. Its $8.5 million in earnings against a production cost of )Tj
T*($800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960.[93] Its mainstream )Tj
T*(distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken U.S. )Tj
T*(film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by )Tj
T*(respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made, "significantly, with the )Tj
T*(lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. )Tj
T*([Its] greatest initial impact¬†... was on schlock horror movies \(notably those )Tj
T*(from second-tier director William Castle\), each of which tried to bill itself )Tj
T*(as scarier than Psycho."[94] Castle's first film in the Psycho vein was )Tj
T*(Homicidal \(1961\), an early step in the development of the slasher subgenre that )Tj
T*(would take off in the late 1970s.[93]Blood Feast \(1963\), a movie about human )Tj
T*(dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by )Tj
T*(experienced nudie-maker Herschell Gordon Lewis, established a new, more )Tj
T*(immediately successful subgenre, the gore or splatter film. Lewis's business )Tj
T*(partner David F. Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to )Tj
T*(theatergoers‚Äîthe sort of gimmick Castle had mastered‚Äîand arranging for an )Tj
T*(injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida‚Äîthe sort of problem )Tj
T*(exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it.[95] )Tj
T*(This new breed of gross-out movie typified the emerging sense of )Tj
T*("exploitation"‚Äîthe progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie )Tj
T*(elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film )Tj
T*(industry as a whole. Imports of Hammer Film's increasingly explicit horror )Tj
T*(movies and Italian gialli, highly stylized pictures mixing sexploitation and )Tj
T*(ultraviolence, would fuel this trend.[96] )Tj
T*( The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968, to be replaced by the )Tj
T*(first version of the modern rating system.[97] That year, two horror films came )Tj
T*(out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade, )Tj
T*(with major consequences for the B movie. One was a high-budget Paramount )Tj
T*(production, directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski. Produced by B horror )Tj
T*(veteran William Castle, Rosemary's Baby was the first upscale Hollywood picture )Tj
T*(in the genre in three decades.[98] It was a critical success and the year's )Tj
T*(seventh-biggest hit.[99] The other was George A. Romero's Night of the Living )Tj
T*(Dead, produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Building on )Tj
T*(the achievement of B genre predecessors like Invasion of the Body Snatchers in )Tj
T*(its subtextual exploration of social and political issues, it doubled as a )Tj
T*(highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and )Tj
T*(domestic racial conflicts. Its greatest influence, though, derived from its )Tj
T*(clever subversion of genre clich√©s and the connection made between its )Tj
T*(exploitation-style imagery, low-cost, truly independent means of production, )Tj
T*(and high profitability.[100] With the Code gone and the X rating established, )Tj
T*(major studio A films like Midnight Cowboy could now show "adult" imagery, while )Tj
T*(the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded. In this transformed )Tj

T*(sexploitation pictures such as Private Duty Nurses \(1971\) and Women in Cages )Tj
T*(\(1971\).[102] )Tj
T*( In May 1969, the most important exploitation movie of the era premiered at the )Tj
T*(Cannes Film Festival.[103] Much of Easy Rider's significance owes to the fact )Tj
T*(that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by )Tj
T*(a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, Peter )Tj
T*(Fonda, to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the )Tj
T*(Corman-directed The Wild Angels \(1966\), a biker movie, and The Trip, as in LSD. )Tj
T*(The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued )Tj
T*(but balked at giving his collaborator, Dennis Hopper, also a studio alumnus, )Tj
T*(free directorial rein. Eventually they arranged a financing and distribution )Tj
T*(deal with Columbia, as two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill )Tj
T*(joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs.[104] The )Tj
T*(film \(which incorporated another favorite exploitation theme, the redneck )Tj
T*(menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity\) was brought in at a cost of )Tj
T*($501,000. It earned $19.1 million in rentals.[105] In the words of historians )Tj
T*(Seth Cagin and Philip Dray, Easy Rider became "the seminal film that provided )Tj
T*(the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by )Tj
T*(schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of )Tj
T*(the seventies."[106] )Tj
T*( [edit] Golden age of exploitation: 1970s )Tj
T*( In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film )Tj
T*(companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as )Tj
T*(well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. )Tj
T*(Operations such as Roger Corman's New World Pictures, Cannon Films, and New )Tj
T*(Line Cinema brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the )Tj
T*(country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running )Tj
T*(time‚Äîin 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes.[107] The Bs were )Tj
T*(keeping pace. In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging )Tj
T*(74.8 minutes. He played a similar part in five films originally released in )Tj
T*(1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World: the average length was 89.8 )Tj
T*(minutes.[108] These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World )Tj
T*(release, the biker movie Angels Die Hard, cost $117,000 to produce and took in )Tj
T*(more than $2 million at the box office.[109] )Tj
T*( The biggest studio in the low-budget field remained a leader in exploitation's )Tj
T*(growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De )Tj
T*(Palma. Reviewing Sisters, Pauline Kael observed that its "limp technique )Tj
T*(doesn't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore.¬†... [H]e )Tj
T*(can't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without )Tj
T*(its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938."[110] Many examples of )Tj
T*(the so-called blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories )Tj
T*(revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of )Tj
T*(AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film )Tj
T*(career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls \(1970\). )Tj
T*(Several New World pictures followed, including The Big Doll House \(1971\) and )Tj
T*(The Big Bird Cage \(1972\), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her )Tj
T*(best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy \(1973\) and Foxy )Tj
T*(Brown \(1974\).[111] )Tj
T*( Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre in which the major studios )Tj
T*(were central. Indeed, the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem \(1970\), )Tj
T*(directed by Ossie Davis, is seen as the first significant film of the )Tj
T*(type.[112] But the movie that truly ignited the blaxploitation phenomenon was )Tj

T*(Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level )Tj

T*(by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam.[121] Canadian )Tj

T*( In the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion )Tj

T*(outside of the studio system, like John Waters's Pink Flamingos \(1972\), with )Tj

T*(an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year )Tj
T*(after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own )Tj

T*( On television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the )Tj

T*(day had long been clear.[132] In the 1970s, original feature-length programming )Tj
T*(increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies )Tj
T*(expanded with the introduction of the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon )Tj
T*(followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time )Tj
T*(and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture )Tj
T*(territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals‚Äîsuch as The Ordeal of )Tj
T*(Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in )Tj
T*(1979‚Äîharkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage )Tj
T*(and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity )Tj
T*(misfortunes.[133] Many 1970s TV films‚Äîsuch as The California Kid \(1974\), )Tj

T*(from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County \(1976\) )Tj
T*(headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage )Tj
T*(exploitation.[134] )Tj
T*( The reverberations of Easy Rider could be felt in such pictures, as well as in )Tj

T*(of the B movie was less direct‚Äîby 1973, the major studios were catching on to )Tj
T*(the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain )Tj
T*(basement. Rosemary's Baby had been a big hit, but it had little in common with )Tj
T*(the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' The Exorcist demonstrated that a heavily )Tj
T*(promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster: it was the biggest movie )Tj
T*(of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. In William )Tj
T*(Paul's description, it is also "the film that really established gross-out as a )Tj
T*(mode of expression for mainstream cinema.¬†... [P]ast exploitation films managed )Tj
T*(to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. The Exorcist made )Tj
T*(cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking )Tj
T*(strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters )Tj
T*(became standard industry practice."[135] Writer-director George Lucas's )Tj
T*(American Graffiti, a Universal production, did something similar. Described by )Tj
T*(Paul as "essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more )Tj
T*(spit and polish", it was 1973's third biggest film and, likewise, by far the )Tj
T*(highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made.[136] Even more historically )Tj
T*(significant movies with B themes and A-level financial backing would follow in )Tj
T*(their wake. )Tj
T*( [edit] Decline of the B: 1980s )Tj
T*( Most of the B movie production houses founded during the exploitation era )Tj
T*(collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field's financial )Tj
T*(situation changed in the early 1980s. Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently )Tj
T*(made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of )Tj
T*(dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of )Tj
T*(expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action )Tj
T*(sequences and realistic special effects.[137] Intimations of the trend were )Tj
T*(evident as early as Airport \(1970\) and especially in the mega-schlock of The )Tj
T*(Poseidon Adventure \(1972\), Earthquake \(1973\), and The Towering Inferno \(1974\). )Tj
T*(Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best; from an industry )Tj
T*(perspective, however, these were pictures firmly rooted in a tradition of )Tj
T*(star-stuffed extravaganzas. The Exorcist had demonstrated the drawing power of )Tj
T*(big-budget, effects-laden horror. But the tidal shift in the majors' focus owed )Tj
T*(largely to the enormous success of three films: Steven Spielberg's creature )Tj
T*(feature Jaws \(1975\) and George Lucas's space opera Star Wars \(1977\) had each, )Tj
T*(in turn, become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history. Superman, )Tj

T*(difficult for the sort of small or non-chain theaters that were the primary )Tj
T*(home of independently produced genre films.[155] Drive-in screens were rapidly )Tj
T*(disappearing from the American landscape.[156] )Tj
T*( Surviving B movie operations adapted in different ways. Releases from Troma )Tj
T*(now frequently went straight to video. New Line, in its first decade, had been )Tj
T*(almost exclusively a distributor of low-budget independent and foreign genre )Tj
T*(pictures. With the smash success of exploitation veteran Wes Craven's original )Tj
T*(Nightmare on Elm Street \(1984\), whose nearly $2 million cost it had directly )Tj
T*(backed, the company began moving steadily into higher-budget genre productions. )Tj
T*(In 1994, New Line was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System; it was soon being )Tj
T*(run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros. )Tj
T*(within the Time Warner conglomerate.[157] The following year, Showtime launched )Tj
T*(Roger Corman Presents, a series of thirteen straight-to-cable movies produced )Tj
T*(by Concorde‚ÄìNew Horizons. A New York Times reviewer found that the initial )Tj
T*(installment qualified as "vintage Corman¬†... spiked with everything from bared )Tj
T*(female breasts to a mind-blowing quote from Thomas Mann's Death in )Tj
T*(Venice."[158] )Tj
T*( At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent )Tj
T*(film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between )Tj
T*(the low-budget genre movie and the "sophisticated" arthouse picture. Director )Tj
T*(Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller )Tj
T*(Killer \(1979\) and Ms. 45 \(1981\), made two works in the early nineties that )Tj
T*(marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to )Tj
T*(complex examinations of honor and redemption: King of New York \(1990\) was )Tj
T*(backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad )Tj
T*(Lieutenant \(1992\), $1.8 million, was financed totally independently.[159]Larry )Tj
T*(Fessenden's micro-budget monster movies, such as No Telling \(1991\) and Habit )Tj
T*(\(1997\), reframe classic genre subjects‚ÄîFrankenstein and vampirism, )Tj
T*(respectively‚Äîto explore issues of contemporary relevance.[160] The budget of )Tj
T*(David Cronenberg's Crash \(1996\), $10 million, was not comfortably A-grade, but )Tj
T*(it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: "On its )Tj
T*(scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's Crash suggests exploitation at its )Tj
T*(most disturbingly sick", wrote critic Janet Maslin.[161] Financed, like King of )Tj
T*(New York, by a consortium of production companies, it was picked up for U.S. )Tj
T*(distribution by Fine Line Features. This result mirrored the film's scrambling )Tj
T*(of definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into )Tj
T*(the Time Warner empire‚Äîspecifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's )Tj
T*(arthouse division.[162]Pulp Fiction \(1994\), directed by Quentin Tarantino on a )Tj
T*($8.5 million budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple )Tj
T*(lines, as James Mottram describes: "With its art house narrative structure, )Tj
T*(B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three )Tj
T*(distinct cinematic traditions to intersect."[163] )Tj
T*( [edit] Transition II/The B movie in the digital age: 2000s )Tj
T*( By the turn of the millennium, the average production cost of an American )Tj
T*(feature had already spent three years above the $50 million mark.[153] In 2005, )Tj
T*(the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of )Tj
T*(children's fantasy novels \(including one extending and another initiating a )Tj
T*(series\), a child-targeted cartoon, a comic book adaptation, a sci-fi series )Tj
T*(installment, a sci-fi remake, and a King Kong remake.[164] It was a slow year )Tj
T*(for Corman: he produced just one movie, which had no American theatrical )Tj
T*(release, true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the )Tj
T*(preceding decade.[165] As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped )Tj
T*(traditional low-rent genres, the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B )Tj
T*(movie was in grave doubt. New York Times critic A. O. Scott warned of the )Tj
T*(impending "extinction" of "the cheesy, campy, guilty pleasures" of the B )Tj
T*(picture, as "the schlock of the past has evolved into star-driven, heavily )Tj

T*( On the other hand, recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something )Tj
T*(like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer )Tj
T*("programmers" bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst )Tj
T*(Alfonso Marone, "The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around )Tj
T*($60 m, rising to $100 m when the cost of marketing for domestic launch \(USA )Tj
T*(only\) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a )Tj
T*(polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions \($120‚Äì150 m\) and )Tj
T*(niche features \($5‚Äì20m\). ... Fewer $30‚Äì70 m releases are expected."[168] Fox )Tj
T*(launched a new subsidiary in 2006, Fox Atomic, to concentrate on teen-oriented )Tj
T*(genre films. The economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major )Tj
T*(studio standards. According to a Variety report, "Fox Atomic is staying at or )Tj
T*(below the $10 million mark for many of its movies. It's also encouraging )Tj
T*(filmmakers to shoot digitally‚Äîa cheaper process that results in a grittier, )Tj
T*(teen-friendly look. And forget about stars. Of Atomic's nine announced films, )Tj
T*(not one has a big name".[169] The newfangled B movie division was shut down in )Tj
T*(2009.[170] )Tj
T*( As the Variety report suggests, recent technological advances greatly )Tj
T*(facilitate the production of truly low-budget motion pictures. Although there )Tj
T*(have always been economical means with which to shoot movies, including Super 8 )Tj
T*(and 16¬†mm film, as well as video cameras recording onto analog videotape, these )Tj
T*(mediums could not rival the image quality of 35¬†mm film. The development of )Tj
T*(digital cameras and postproduction methods now allow even low-budget filmmakers )Tj
T*(to produce films with excellent, and not necessarily "grittier", image quality )Tj
T*(and editing effects. As Marone observes, "the equipment budget \(camera, )Tj
T*(support\) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10 that for film, )Tj
T*(significantly lowering the production budget for independent features. At the )Tj
T*(same time, [since the early 2000s], the quality of digital filmmaking has )Tj
T*(improved dramatically."[168] Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre )Tj
T*(or arthouse mode, continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution )Tj
T*(channels, though so-called digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new )Tj
T*(opportunities. In a similar way, Internet sites such as YouTube have opened up )Tj
T*(entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures.[171] )Tj
T*( [edit] Associated terms )Tj
T*( The terms C movie and the more common Z movie describe progressively lower )Tj
T*(grades of the B movie category. The terms drive-in movie and midnight movie, )Tj
T*(which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena, are now often )Tj
T*(used as synonyms for B movie. A more recently coined synonym is psychotronic )Tj
T*(movie. )Tj
T*( [edit] C movie )Tj
T*( The C movie is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie, )Tj
T*(or‚Äîin some taxonomies‚Äîsimply below it.[172] In the 1980s, with the growth of )Tj
T*(cable television, the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to )Tj
T*(low-quality genre films used as filler programming for that market. The "C" in )Tj
T*(the term then does double duty, referring not only to quality that is lower )Tj
T*(than "B" but also to the initial c of cable. Helping to popularize the notion )Tj
T*(of the C movie was the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000 \(1988‚Äì99\), which )Tj
T*(ran on national cable channels \(first Comedy Central, then the Sci Fi Channel\) )Tj
T*(after its first year. Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over )Tj
T*(three decades before, MST3K presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily )Tj
T*(science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary )Tj
T*(highlighting the films' shortcomings. Director Ed Wood has been called "the )Tj
T*(master of the 'C-movie'" in this sense, although Z movie \(see below\) is perhaps )Tj
T*(even more applicable to his work.[173] The rapid expansion of niche cable and )Tj
T*(satellite outlets such as Sci Fi \(with its Sci Fi Pictures\) and HBO's genre )Tj
T*(channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant an ongoing market for contemporary C )Tj
T*(pictures, many of them "direct to cable" movies‚Äîmodestly budgeted genre films )Tj
T*(never released in theaters.[174] )Tj
T*( [edit] Z movie )Tj

T*(movies. Most films referred to as Z movies are made on very small budgets by )Tj
T*(operations on the fringes of the commercial film industry. The micro-budget )Tj
T*("quickies" of 1930s fly-by-night Poverty Row production houses may be thought )Tj

T*(Glen or Glenda \(1953\) and Plan 9 from Outer Space \(1959\)‚Äîfrequently cited as )Tj
T*(one of the worst pictures ever made‚Äîexemplify the classic grade-Z movie. )Tj
T*(Latter-day Zs are often characterized by violent, gory, and/or sexual content )Tj
T*(and a minimum of artistic interest; much of this product is destined for the )Tj

T*( [edit] Psychotronic movie )Tj
T*( Psychotronic movie is a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon‚Äîreferred )Tj
T*(to by a fellow critic as "the historian of marginal movies"‚Äîto denote the sort )Tj
T*(of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely )Tj
T*(by the critical establishment.[177] Weldon's immediate source for the term was )Tj
T*(the Chicago cult film The Psychotronic Man \(1980\), whose titular character is a )Tj
T*(barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy. According to )Tj
T*(Weldon, "My original idea with that word is that it's a two-part word. 'Psycho' )Tj
T*(stands for the horror movies, and 'tronic' stands for the science fiction )Tj
T*(movies. I very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of )Tj
T*(exploitation or B-movie."[178] The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s )Tj
T*(with publications of Weldon's such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film and )Tj
T*(Psychotronic Video magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and )Tj
T*(fans. Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B )Tj
T*(movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp.[179] )Tj

T*(Gregory prayed to Christ that if he would deliver him, he would dedicate his )Tj
T*(life to His service.[2]:28 While at Athens, he developed a close friendship )Tj
T*(with his fellow student Basil of Caesarea and also made the acquaintance of )Tj
T*(Flavius Claudius Julianus, who would later become the emperor known as Julian )Tj
T*(the Apostate.[3]:19,25 In Athens, Gregory studied under the famous rhetoricians )Tj
T*(Himerius and Proaeresius.[4] Upon finishing his education, he taught rhetoric )Tj
T*(in Athens for a short time. )Tj
T*( [edit] Priesthood )Tj
T*( In 361 Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a presbyter by his )Tj
T*(father, who wanted him to assist with caring for local Christians.[2]:99‚Äì102 )Tj
T*(The younger Gregory, who had been considering a monastic existence, resented )Tj
T*(his father's decision to force him to choose between priestly services and a )Tj
T*(solitary existence, calling it an "act of tyranny".[3]:32[5] Leaving home after )Tj
T*(a few days, he met his friend Basil at Annesoi, where the two lived as )Tj
T*(ascetics.[2]:102 However, Basil urged him to return home to assist his father, )Tj
T*(which he did for the next year. Arriving at Nazianzus, Gregory found the local )Tj
T*(Christian community split by theological differences and his father accused of )Tj
T*(heresy by local monks.[2]:107 Gregory helped to heal the division through a )Tj
T*(combination of personal diplomacy and oratory. )Tj
T*( By this time Emperor Julian had publicly declared himself in opposition to )Tj
T*(Christianity.[2]:115 In response to the emperor's rejection of the Christian )Tj
T*(faith, Gregory composed his Invectives Against Julian between 362 and 363. )Tj
T*(Invectives asserts that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as )Tj
T*(Julian through love and patience. This process as described by Gregory is the )Tj
T*(public manifestation of the process of deification \(theosis\), which leads to a )Tj
T*(spiritual elevation and mystical union with God.[2]:121 Julian resolved, in )Tj
T*(late 362, to vigorously prosecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; )Tj
T*(however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the )Tj
T*(Persians.[2]:125‚Äì6 With the death of the emperor, Gregory and the Eastern )Tj
T*(churches were no longer under the threat of persecution, as the new emperor )Tj
T*(Jovian was an avowed Christian and supporter of the church.[2]:130 )Tj
T*( Gregory spent the next few years combating Arianism, which threatened to )Tj
T*(divide the region of Cappadocia. In this tense environment, Gregory interceded )Tj
T*(on behalf of his friend Basil with Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea )Tj
T*(\(Maritima\).[2]:138‚Äì42 The two friends then entered a period of close fraternal )Tj
T*(cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean )Tj
T*(church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and )Tj
T*(rhetors.[2]:143 In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of )Tj
T*(the Emperor Valens, Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success )Tj
T*(confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration )Tj
T*(of the Church.[2]:143 Basil, who had long displayed inclinations to the )Tj
T*(episcopacy, was elected bishop of the see of Caesarea in Cappadocia in 370. )Tj
T*( [edit] Episcopate in Sasima and Nazianzus )Tj
T*( Gregory was ordained Bishop of Sasima in 372 by Basil.[2]:190‚Äì5 Basil created )Tj
T*(this see in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with Anthimus, )Tj
T*(bishop of Tyana.[4] The ambitions of Gregory's father to have his son rise in )Tj
T*(the Church hierarchy and the insistence of his friend Basil convinced Gregory )Tj
T*(to accept this position despite his reservations. Gregory would later refer to )Tj
T*(his episcopal ordination as forced upon him by his strong-willed father and )Tj
T*(Basil.[2]:187‚Äì92 Describing his new bishopric, Gregory lamented how it was )Tj
T*(nothing more than an "utterly dreadful, pokey little hole; a paltry horse-stop )Tj
T*(on the main road¬†... devoid of water, vegetation, or the company of gentlemen¬†)Tj
T*(... this was my Church of Sasima!"[6] He made little effort to administer his )Tj
T*(new diocese, complaining to Basil that he preferred instead to pursue a )Tj
T*(contemplative life.[3]:38‚Äì9 )Tj
T*( By late 372 Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the )Tj
T*(administration of his diocese.[2]:199 This strained his relationship with )Tj

T*(great episcopal orations. )Tj
T*( Following the deaths of his mother and father in 374, Gregory continued to )Tj
T*(administer the Diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop. Donating )Tj
T*(most of his inheritance to the needy, he lived an austere existence.[4] At the )Tj
T*(end of 375 he withdrew to a monastery at Seleukia, living there for three )Tj
T*(years. Near the end of this period his friend Basil died. Although Gregory's )Tj
T*(health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of )Tj
T*(condolence to Basil's brother, Gregory of Nyssa and composed twelve memorial )Tj
T*(poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend. )Tj
T*( [edit] Gregory at Constantinople )Tj
T*( Emperor Valens died in 378. The accession of Theodosius I, a steadfast )Tj
T*(supporter of Nicene orthodoxy, was good news to those who wished to purge )Tj
T*(Constantinople of Arian and Apollinarian domination.[2]:235 The exiled Nicene )Tj
T*(party gradually returned to the city. From his deathbed, Basil reminded them of )Tj
T*(Gregory's capabilities and likely recommended his friend to champion the )Tj
T*(trinitarian cause in Constantinople.[2]:235‚Äì6[8] )Tj
T*( In 379, the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletios, asked Gregory to go to )Tj
T*(Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene )Tj
T*(orthodoxy.[3]:42 After much hesitation, Gregory agreed. His cousin Theodosia )Tj
T*(offered him a villa for his residence; Gregory immediately transformed much of )Tj
T*(it into a church, naming it Anastasia, "a scene for the resurrection of the )Tj
T*(faith".[2]:241[9] From this little chapel he delivered five powerful discourses )Tj
T*(on Nicene doctrine, explaining the nature of the Trinity and the unity of the )Tj
T*(Godhead.[4] Refuting the Eunomion denial of the Holy Spirit's divinity, Gregory )Tj
T*(offered this argument: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Look at these facts: Christ is born, the Holy Spirit is His Forerunner. Christ )Tj
T*(is baptized, the Spirit bears witness to this¬†... Christ works miracles, the )Tj
T*(Spirit accompanies them. Christ ascends, the Spirit takes His place. What great )Tj
T*(things are there in the idea of God which are not in His power? What titles )Tj
T*(appertaining to God do not apply also to Him, except for Unbegotten and )Tj
T*(Begotten? I tremble when I think of such an abundance of titles, and how many )Tj
T*(Names they blaspheme, those who revolt against the Spirit![10])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Gregory's homilies were well received and attracted ever-growing crowds to )Tj
T*(Anastasia. Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike. On the )Tj
T*(vigil of Easter in 379, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship )Tj
T*(services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop. Escaping the mob, )Tj
T*(Gregory next found himself betrayed by his erstwhile friend, the philosopher )Tj
T*(Maximus the Cynic. Maximus, who was in secret alliance with Peter, bishop of )Tj
T*(Alexandria, attempted to seize Gregory's position and have himself ordained )Tj
T*(bishop of Constantinople.[3]:43 Shocked, Gregory decided to resign his office, )Tj
T*(but the faction faithful to him induced him to stay and ejected Maximus. )Tj
T*(However, the episode left him embarrassed and exposed him to criticism as a )Tj
T*(provincial simpleton unable to cope with intrigues of the imperial city.[3]:43 )Tj
T*( Affairs in Constantinople remained confused as Gregory's position was still )Tj
T*(unofficial and Arian priests occupied many important churches. The arrival of )Tj
T*(the emperor Theodosius in 380 settled matters in Gregory's favor. The emperor, )Tj
T*(determined to eliminate Arianism, expelled Bishop Demophilus. Gregory was )Tj
T*(subsequently enthroned as bishop of Constantinople at the Basilica of the )Tj
T*(Apostles, replacing Demophilus.[3]:45 )Tj

T*(Paulinus as Patriarch of Antioch. The Egyptian and Macedonian bishops who had )Tj
T*(supported Maximus's ordination arrived late for the Council. Once there, they )Tj
T*(refused to recognise Gregory's position as head of the church of )Tj
T*(Constantinople, arguing that his transfer from the See of Sasima was )Tj
T*(canonically illegitimate.[2]:358‚Äì9 )Tj
T*( Gregory was physically exhausted and worried that he was losing the confidence )Tj
T*(of the bishops and the emperor.[2]:359 Rather than press his case and risk )Tj
T*(further division, he decided to resign his office: "Let me be as the Prophet )Tj
T*(Jonah! I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the )Tj
T*(salvation of the ship. Seize me and throw me¬†... I was not happy when I )Tj
T*(ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it."[11] He shocked the Council )Tj
T*(with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to )Tj
T*(Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his )Tj
T*(words, applauded, commended his labor and granted his resignation. The Council )Tj
T*(asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. )Tj
T*(Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address \(Or. 42\) and then )Tj
T*(departed.[2]:361 )Tj
T*( Returning to his homeland of Cappadocia, Gregory once again resumed his )Tj
T*(position as bishop of Nazianzus. He spent the next year combating the local )Tj
T*(Appolinarian heretics and struggling with periodic illness. He also began )Tj
T*(composing De Vita Sua, his autobiographical poem.[3]:50 By the end of 383 he )Tj
T*(found his health too feeble to cope with episcopal duties. Gregory established )Tj
T*(Eulalius as bishop of Nazianzus and then withdrew into the solitude of )Tj
T*(Arianzum. After enjoying five peaceful years in retirement at his family )Tj
T*(estate, he died on January 25 in 389. )Tj
T*( Throughout his life Gregory faced stark choices. Should he pursue studies as a )Tj
T*(rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more appropriate than public )Tj
T*(ministry? Was it better to blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for )Tj
T*(him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which )Tj
T*(both tormented and motivated him. Biographers suggest that it was this )Tj
T*(dialectic which defined him, forged his character and inspired his search for )Tj
T*(meaning and truth.[3]:54 )Tj
T*( [edit] Legacy )Tj
T*( [edit] Theological and other works )Tj
T*( Gregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of )Tj
T*(the doctrine of the Trinity. He is especially noted for his contributions to )Tj
T*(the field of pneumatology‚Äîthat is, theology concerning the nature of the Holy )Tj
T*(Spirit.[12] In this regard, Gregory is the first to use the idea of procession )Tj
T*(to describe the relationship between the Spirit and the Godhead: "The Holy )Tj
T*(Spirit is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed but not after the )Tj
T*(manner of the Son, for it is not by generation but by procession, since I must )Tj
T*(coin a word for the sake of clearness."[13] Although Gregory does not fully )Tj
T*(develop the concept, the idea of procession would shape most later thought )Tj
T*(about the Holy Spirit.[14] )Tj
T*( He emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did )Tj
T*(he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, )Tj
T*(Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul. He )Tj
T*(also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy )Tj
T*(Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the Old Testament but much clearer )Tj
T*(since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at )Tj
T*(the feast of Pentecost. )Tj
T*( In contrast to the Neo-Arian belief that the Son is ahomoios, or "unlike" the )Tj
T*(Father, and with the Semi-Arian assertion that the Son is homoiousios, or )Tj
T*("like" the Father, Gregory and his fellow Cappadocians maintained the Nicaean )Tj

T*( Some of Gregory's theological writings suggest that, like his friend Gregory )Tj
T*(of Nyssa, he may have supported some form of the doctrine of apocatastasis, the )Tj
T*(belief that God will bring all of creation into harmony with the Kingdom of )Tj
T*(Heaven.[16] This led some late-nineteenth century Christian universalists, )Tj
T*(notably J. W. Hanson and Philip Schaff, to describe Gregory's theology as )Tj
T*(universalist.[17] This view of Gregory is also held by some modern theologians, )Tj
T*(such as John Sachs who said that Gregory had "leanings" toward apocatastasis, )Tj
T*(but in a "cautious, undogmatic" way.[18] However, it is not clear or )Tj
T*(universally accepted that Gregory held to the doctrine of apocatastasis.[19] )Tj
T*( Apart from the several theological discourses, Gregory was also one of the )Tj
T*(most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, )Tj
T*(perhaps one of the greatest of his time,[15]:21 and also a very prolific poet, )Tj
T*(writing several poems with theological and moral matter and some with )Tj
T*(biographical content, about himself and about his friends \(one short poem, "Eis )Tj
T*(ta Emmetra", actually lays down some rules for the composition of poetry\). )Tj
T*( [edit] Influence )Tj
T*( Gregory's great nephew Nichobulos served as his literary executor, preserving )Tj
T*(and editing many of his writings. A cousin, Eulalios, published several of )Tj
T*(Gregory's more noteworthy works in 391.[2]:xi By 400, Rufinius began )Tj
T*(translating his orations into Latin. As Gregory's works circulated throughout )Tj
T*(the empire they influenced theological thought. His orations were cited as )Tj
T*(authoritative by the First Council of Ephesus in 431. By 451 he was designated )Tj
T*(Theologus, or Theologian by the Council of Chalcedon[2]:xi ‚Äî a title held by no )Tj
T*(others save John the Apostle[4] and Symeon the New Theologian. He is widely )Tj
T*(quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the )Tj
T*(Christian faith. His contributions to Trinitarian theology are also influential )Tj
T*(and often cited in the Western churches.[20]Paul Tillich credits Gregory of )Tj
T*(Nazianzus for having "created the definitive formulae for the doctrine of the )Tj
T*(trinity".[21] Additionally, the Liturgy of St Gregory the Theologian in use by )Tj
T*(the Coptic Church is named after him.[22] )Tj
T*( [edit] Relics )Tj
T*( Following his death, Saint Gregory was buried at Nazianzus. His relics were )Tj
T*(transferred to Constantinople in 950, into the Church of the Holy Apostles. )Tj
T*(Part of the relics were taken from Constantinople by Crusaders during the )Tj
T*(Fourth Crusade, in 1204, and ended up in Rome. On November 27, 2004, those )Tj
T*(relics, along with those of John Chrysostom, were returned to Istanbul )Tj
T*(\(Constantinople\) by Pope John Paul II, with the Vatican retaining a small )Tj
T*(portion of both. The relics are now enshrined in the Patriarchal Cathedral of )Tj
T*(St. George in the Fanar.[23] )Tj
T*( [edit] Feast day )Tj
T*( In the Western churches Gregory's feast day is on January 2.[24] The Eastern )Tj
T*(Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches celebrate two feast days in )Tj
T*(honor of Gregory: January 25 as his primary feast and January 30, known as the )Tj
T*(feast of the Three Great Hierarchs, which commemorates him along with John )Tj
T*(Chrysoston and Basil of Caesarea.[25][26] )Tj

T*( Matthew Boulton FRS \(/Ààbo ält…ôn/; 3 September 1728¬†‚Äì 17 August 1809\) was an )Tj
T*(English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt. In )Tj
T*(the final quarter of the 18th century the partnership installed hundreds of )Tj
T*(Boulton &amp; Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of )Tj
T*(the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton )Tj
T*(applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces )Tj
T*(for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date )Tj
T*(equipment. )Tj
T*( Born in Birmingham, England in 1728, Boulton was the son of a Birmingham )Tj
T*(manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then )Tj
T*(Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it )Tj
T*(considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him )Tj
T*(near Birmingham. At Soho, he adopted the latest techniques, branching into )Tj
T*(silver plate, ormolu and other decorative arts. He became associated with James )Tj
T*(Watt when Watt's business partner, John Roebuck, was unable to pay a debt to )Tj
T*(Boulton, who accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then )Tj
T*(successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 )Tj
T*(years, enabling the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed )Tj
T*(hundreds of Boulton &amp; Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially )Tj

T*( Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Birmingham-area men )Tj
T*(prominent in the arts, sciences, and theology. Members included Watt, Erasmus )Tj
T*(Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley. The Society met each month near )Tj
T*(the full moon. Members of the Society have been given credit for developing )Tj
T*(concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and )Tj
T*(transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution. )Tj
T*( Boulton founded the Soho Mint, to which he soon adapted steam power. He sought )Tj
T*(to improve the poor state of Britain's coinage, and after several years of )Tj
T*(effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage )Tj
T*(in a quarter century. His "cartwheel" pieces were well-designed and difficult )Tj
T*(to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper British )Tj
T*(penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971. He retired in )Tj
T*(1800, though continuing to run his mint, and died in 1809. His image appears )Tj
T*(alongside James Watt on the Bank of England ¬£50 note. )Tj
T*( [edit] Background )Tj
T*( Birmingham had long been a centre of the ironworking industry. In the early )Tj
T*(18th century the town entered a period of expansion as iron working became )Tj
T*(easier and cheaper with the transition \(beginning in 1709\) from charcoal to )Tj
T*(coke as a means of smelting iron. Scarcity of wood in increasingly deforested )Tj
T*(England and discoveries of large quantities of coal in Birmingham's county of )Tj
T*(Warwickshire and the adjacent county of Staffordshire speeded the transition. )Tj
T*(Much of the iron was forged in small foundries near Birmingham, especially in )Tj
T*(the Black Country, including nearby towns such as Smethwick and West Bromwich. )Tj
T*(The resultant thin iron sheets were transported to factories in and around )Tj
T*(Birmingham. With the town far from the sea and great rivers and with canals not )Tj
T*(yet built, metalworkers concentrated on producing small, relatively valuable )Tj
T*(pieces, especially buttons and buckles. Frenchman Alexander Missen wrote that )Tj
T*(while he had seen excellent cane heads, snuff boxes and other metal objects in )Tj
T*(Milan, "the same can be had cheaper and better in Birmingham". These small )Tj
T*(objects came to be known as "toys", and their manufacturers as "toymakers". )Tj
T*( Boulton was a descendant of families from around Lichfield, his )Tj
T*(great-great-great-great grandfather, Rev. Zachary Babington, having been )Tj
T*(Chancellor of Lichfield. Boulton's father, also named Matthew and born in 1700, )Tj
T*(moved to Birmingham from Lichfield to serve an apprenticeship, and in 1723 he )Tj
T*(married Christiana Piers. The elder Boulton was a toymaker with a small )Tj
T*(workshop specialising in buckles. Matthew Boulton was born in 1728, their third )Tj
T*(child and the second of that name, the first Matthew having died at the age of )Tj
T*(two in 1726. )Tj
T*( [edit] Early and family life )Tj
T*( The elder Boulton's business prospered after young Matthew's birth, and the )Tj
T*(family moved to the Snow Hill area of Birmingham, then a well-to-do )Tj
T*(neighbourhood of new houses. As the local grammar school was in disrepair )Tj
T*(Boulton was sent to an academy in Deritend, on the other side of Birmingham. At )Tj
T*(the age of 15 he left school, and by 17 he had invented a technique for )Tj
T*(inlaying enamels in buckles that proved so popular that the buckles were )Tj
T*(exported to France, then reimported to Britain and billed as the latest French )Tj
T*(developments. )Tj
T*( On 3 March 1749 Boulton married Mary Robinson, a distant cousin and the )Tj
T*(daughter of a successful mercer, and wealthy in her own right. They lived )Tj
T*(briefly with the bride's mother in Lichfield, and then moved to Birmingham )Tj
T*(where the elder Matthew Boulton made his son a partner at the age of 21. Though )Tj
T*(the son signed business letters "from father and self", by the mid-1750s he was )Tj
T*(effectively running the business. The elder Boulton retired in 1757 and died in )Tj
T*(1759. )Tj
T*( The Boultons had three daughters in the early 1750s, but all died in infancy. )Tj
T*(Mary Boulton's health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after )Tj
T*(her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. Marriage with a deceased wife's )Tj
T*(sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. The )Tj
T*(union was opposed by Anne's brother Luke, who feared Boulton would control \(and )Tj
T*(possibly dissipate\) much of the Robinson family fortune. Nonetheless, they )Tj

T*(Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. When the month )Tj

T*(secrecy, and Scotland." )Tj
T*( The Boultons had two children, Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton. In )Tj
T*(1764 Luke Robinson died, and his estate passed to his sister Anne and thus into )Tj
T*(Matthew Boulton's control. )Tj
T*( [edit] Innovator )Tj
T*( [edit] Expansion of the business )Tj
T*( After the death of his father in 1759, Boulton took full control of the family )Tj
T*(toymaking business. He spent much of his time in London and elsewhere, )Tj
T*(promoting his wares. He arranged for a friend to present a sword to Prince )Tj
T*(Edward, and the gift so interested the Prince's older brother, George, Prince )Tj
T*(of Wales, the future King George III, that he ordered one for himself. )Tj
T*( With capital accumulated from his two marriages and his inheritance from his )Tj
T*(father, Boulton sought a larger site to expand his business. In 1761 he leased )Tj
T*(13 acres \(5.3¬†ha\) at Soho, then just in Staffordshire, with a residence, Soho )Tj
T*(House, and a rolling mill. Soho House was at first occupied by Boulton )Tj
T*(relatives, and then by his first partner, John Fothergill. In 1766 Boulton )Tj
T*(required Fothergill to vacate Soho House, and lived there himself with his )Tj
T*(family. Both husband and wife died there, Anne Boulton of an apparent stroke in )Tj
T*(1783 and her husband after a long illness in 1809. )Tj
T*( The 13 acres \(5¬†ha\) at Soho included common land that Boulton enclosed, later )Tj
T*(decrying what he saw as the "idle beggarly" condition of the people who had )Tj
T*(used it. By 1765 his Soho Manufactory had been erected. The warehouse, or )Tj
T*("principal building", had a Palladian front and 19 bays for loading and )Tj
T*(unloading, and had quarters for clerks and managers on the upper storeys. The )Tj
T*(structure was designed by local architect William Wyatt at a time when )Tj
T*(industrial buildings were commonly designed by engineers. Other buildings )Tj
T*(contained workshops. Boulton and Fothergill invested in the most advanced )Tj
T*(metalworking equipment, and the complex was admired as a modern industrial )Tj
T*(marvel. Although the cost of the principal building alone had been estimated at )Tj
T*(¬£2,000 \(about ¬£276,000 today\);[22] the final cost was five times that amount. )Tj
T*(The partnership spent over ¬£20,000 in building and equipping the premises. The )Tj
T*(partners' means were not equal to the total costs, which were met only by heavy )Tj
T*(borrowing and by artful management of creditors. )Tj
T*( Among the products Boulton sought to make in his new facility were sterling )Tj
T*(silver plate for those able to afford it, and Sheffield plate, silver-plated )Tj
T*(copper, for those less well off. Boulton and his father had long made small )Tj
T*(silver items, but there is no record of large items in either silver or )Tj
T*(Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton did so. To make items )Tj
T*(such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition, the firm made )Tj
T*(many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which were shaped and joined )Tj
T*(together. One impediment to Boulton's work was the lack of an assay office in )Tj
T*(Birmingham. The silver toys long made by the family firm were generally too )Tj
T*(light to require assaying, but silver plate had to be sent over 70 miles \(110¬†)Tj
T*(km\) to the nearest assay office, at Chester, to be assayed and hallmarked, with )Tj
T*(the attendant risks of damage and loss. Alternatively they could be sent to )Tj
T*(London, but this exposed them to the risk of being copied by competitors. )Tj
T*(Boulton wrote in 1771, "I am very desirous of becoming a great silversmith, yet )Tj
T*(I am determined not to take up that branch in the large way I intended, unless )Tj
T*(powers can be obtained to have a marking hall [assay office] at Birmingham." )Tj
T*(Boulton petitioned Parliament for the establishment of an assay office in )Tj
T*(Birmingham. Though the petition was bitterly opposed by London goldsmiths, he )Tj
T*(was successful in getting Parliament to pass an act establishing assay offices )Tj

T*(in Birmingham and Sheffield, whose silversmiths had faced similar difficulties )Tj
T*(in transporting their wares. The silver business proved not to be profitable )Tj
T*(due to the opportunity cost of keeping a large amount of capital tied up in the )Tj
T*(inventory of silver. The firm continued to make large quantities of Sheffield )Tj
T*(plate, but Boulton delegated responsibility for this enterprise to trusted )Tj
T*(subordinates, involving himself little in it. )Tj
T*( As part of Boulton's efforts to market to the wealthy, he started to sell )Tj
T*(vases decorated with ormolu, previously a French specialty. Ormolu was milled )Tj
T*(gold \(from the French or moulu\) amalgamated with mercury, and applied to the )Tj
T*(item, which was then heated to drive off the mercury, leaving the gold )Tj
T*(decoration. In the late 1760s and early 1770s there was a fashion among the )Tj
T*(wealthy for decorated vases, and he sought to cater to this craze. He initially )Tj
T*(ordered ceramic vases from his friend and fellow Lunar Society member Josiah )Tj
T*(Wedgwood, but ceramic proved unable to bear the weight of the decorations and )Tj
T*(Boulton chose marble and other decorative stone as the material for his vases. )Tj
T*(Boulton copied vase designs from classical Greek works and borrowed works of )Tj
T*(art from collectors, merchants, and sculptors. Fothergill and others searched )Tj
T*(Europe for designs for these creations. In March 1770 Boulton visited the Royal )Tj
T*(Family and sold several vases to Queen Charlotte, George III's wife. He ran )Tj
T*(annual sales at Christie's in 1771 and 1772. The Christie's exhibition )Tj
T*(succeeded in publicising Boulton and his products, which were highly praised, )Tj
T*(but the sales were not financially successful with many works left unsold or )Tj
T*(sold below cost. When the craze for vases ended in the early 1770s, the )Tj
T*(partnership was left with a large stock on its hands, and disposed of much of )Tj
T*(it in a single massive sale to Catherine the Great of Russia‚Äîthe Empress )Tj
T*(described the vases as superior to French ormolu, and cheaper as well. Boulton )Tj
T*(continued to solicit orders, though "ormolu" was dropped from the firm's )Tj
T*(business description from 1779, and when the Boulton-Fothergill partnership was )Tj
T*(dissolved by the latter's 1782 death there were only 14¬†items of ormolu in the )Tj
T*("toy room". )Tj
T*( Among Boulton's most successful products were mounts for small Wedgwood )Tj
T*(products such as plaques, cameo brooches and buttons in the distinctive )Tj
T*(ceramics, notably jasper ware, for which Wedgwood's firm remains well known. )Tj
T*(The mounts of these articles, many of which have survived, were made of ormolu )Tj
T*(or cut steel, which had a jewel-like gleam.[38] Boulton and Wedgwood were )Tj
T*(friends, alternately cooperating and competing, and Wedgwood wrote of Boulton, )Tj
T*("It doubles my courage to have the first Manufacturer in England to encounter )Tj
T*(with‚ÄîThe match likes me well‚ÄîI like the Man, I like his spirit."[38] )Tj
T*( In the 1770s Boulton introduced an insurance system for his workers that )Tj
T*(served as the model for later schemes, allowing his workers compensation in the )Tj
T*(event of injury or illness.[39] The first of its kind in any large )Tj
T*(establishment, employees paid one-sixtieth of their wages into the Soho )Tj
T*(Friendly Society, membership in which was mandatory. The firm's apprentices )Tj
T*(were poor or orphaned boys, trainable into skilled workmen; he declined to hire )Tj
T*(the sons of gentlemen as apprentices, stating that they would be "out of place" )Tj
T*(among the poorer boys. )Tj
T*( Not all of Boulton's innovations proved successful. Together with painter )Tj
T*(Francis Eginton,[a] he created a process for the mechanical reproduction of )Tj
T*(paintings for middle-class homes, but eventually abandoned the procedure. )Tj
T*(Boulton and James Keir produced an alloy called "Eldorado metal" that they )Tj
T*(claimed would not corrode in water and could be used for sheathing wooden )Tj
T*(ships. After sea trials the Admiralty rejected their claims, and the metal was )Tj
T*(used for sashes at Soho House. Boulton feared that construction of a nearby )Tj
T*(canal would damage his water supply, but this did not prove to be the case, and )Tj
T*(in 1779 he wrote, "Our navigation goes on prosperously; the junction with the )Tj
T*(Wolverhampton Canal is complete, and we already sail to Bristol and to Hull." )Tj
T*( [edit] Partnership with Watt )Tj

T*(or to drive equipment directly would help to provide the necessary power.[45] )Tj
T*(He began to correspond with Watt in 1766, and first met him two years later. In )Tj
T*(1769 Watt patented an engine with the innovation of a separate condenser, )Tj
T*(making it far more efficient than earlier engines. Boulton realised not only )Tj
T*(that this engine could power his manufactory, but also that its production )Tj
T*(might be a profitable business venture.[46] )Tj
T*( After receiving the patent, Watt did little to develop the engine into a )Tj
T*(marketable invention, turning to other work. In 1772, Watt's partner, Dr. John )Tj
T*(Roebuck, ran into financial difficulties, and Boulton, to whom he owed ¬£1,200, )Tj
T*(accepted his two-thirds share in Watt's patent as satisfaction of the debt. )Tj
T*(Boulton's partner Fothergill refused to have any part in the speculation, and )Tj
T*(accepted cash for his share.[46] Boulton's share was worth little without )Tj
T*(Watt's efforts to improve his invention. At the time, the principal use of )Tj
T*(steam engines was to pump water out of mines. The engine commonly in use was )Tj
T*(the Newcomen steam engine, which consumed large amounts of coal and, as mines )Tj
T*(became deeper, proved incapable of keeping them clear of water. Watt's work was )Tj
T*(well known, and a number of mines that needed engines put off purchasing them )Tj
T*(in the hope that Watt would soon market his invention. )Tj
T*( Boulton boasted about Watt's talents, leading to an employment offer from the )Tj
T*(Russian government, which Boulton had to persuade Watt to turn down. In 1774 he )Tj
T*(was able to convince Watt to move to Birmingham, and they entered into a )Tj
T*(partnership the following year. By 1775 six of the 14 years of Watt's original )Tj
T*(patent had elapsed, but thanks to Boulton's lobbying Parliament passed an act )Tj
T*(extending Watt's patent until 1800.[46] Boulton and Watt began work improving )Tj
T*(the engine. With the assistance of iron master John Wilkinson \(brother-in-law )Tj
T*(of Lunar Society member Joseph Priestley\), they succeeded in making the engine )Tj
T*(commercially viable. )Tj
T*( In 1776 the partnership erected two engines, one for Wilkinson and one at a )Tj
T*(mine in Tipton in the Black Country. Both engines were successfully installed, )Tj
T*(leading to favourable publicity for the partnership. Boulton and Watt began to )Tj
T*(install engines elsewhere. The firm rarely produced the engine itself: it had )Tj
T*(the purchaser buy parts from a number of suppliers and then assembled the )Tj
T*(engine on-site under the supervision of a Soho engineer. The company made its )Tj
T*(profit by comparing the amount of coal used by the machine with that used by an )Tj
T*(earlier, less efficient Newcomen engine, and required payments of one-third of )Tj
T*(the savings annually for the next 25¬†years.[53] This pricing scheme led to )Tj
T*(disputes, as many mines fuelled the engines using coal of unmarketable quality )Tj
T*(that cost the mine owners only the expense of extraction.[53] Mine owners were )Tj
T*(also reluctant to make the annual payments, viewing the engines as theirs once )Tj
T*(erected, and threatened to petition Parliament to repeal Watt's patent. )Tj
T*( The county of Cornwall was a major market for the firm's engines. It was )Tj
T*(mineral-rich and had many mines. However, the special problems for mining )Tj
T*(there, including local rivalries and high prices for coal, which had to be )Tj
T*(imported from Wales, forced Watt and later Boulton to spend several months a )Tj
T*(year in Cornwall overseeing installations and resolving problems with the )Tj
T*(mineowners. In 1779 the firm hired engineer William Murdoch,[b] who was able to )Tj
T*(take over the management of most of the on-site installation problems, allowing )Tj
T*(Watt and Boulton to remain in Birmingham.[53] )Tj
T*( The pumping engine for use in mines was a great success. In 1782 the firm )Tj
T*(sought to modify Watt's invention so that the engine had a rotary motion, )Tj
T*(making it suitable for use in mills and factories. On a 1781 visit to Wales )Tj
T*(Boulton had seen a powerful copper-rolling mill driven by water, and when told )Tj
T*(it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam )Tj
T*(engine would remedy that defect. Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification )Tj
T*(of the engine, warning that they were reaching the limits of the pumping engine )Tj
T*(market: "There is no other Cornwall to be found, and the most likely line for )Tj
T*(increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills, )Tj
T*(which is certainly an extensive field." Watt spent much of 1782 on the )Tj
T*(modification project, and though he was concerned that few orders would result, )Tj
T*(completed it at the end of the year. One order was received in 1782, and )Tj

T*(several others from mills and breweries soon after. George III toured the )Tj
T*(Whitbread brewery in London, and was impressed by the engine. As a )Tj
T*(demonstration, Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150¬†)Tj
T*(bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London. While the mill was not )Tj
T*(financially successful, according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a )Tj
T*("publicity stunt par excellence" for the firm's latest innovation. Before its )Tj
T*(1791 destruction by fire, the mill's fame, according to early historian Samuel )Tj
T*(Smiles, "spread far and wide", and orders for rotative engines poured in not )Tj
T*(only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies. )Tj
T*( Between 1775 and 1800 the firm produced approximately 450¬†engines. It did not )Tj
T*(let other manufacturers produce engines with separate condensers, and )Tj
T*(approximately 1,000¬†Newcomen engines, less efficient but cheaper and not )Tj
T*(subject to the restrictions of Watt's patent, were produced in Britain during )Tj
T*(that time.[63] Boulton boasted to James Boswell when the diarist toured Soho, )Tj
T*("I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have‚ÄîPOWER." The development )Tj
T*(of an efficient steam engine allowed large-scale industry to be developed,[65] )Tj
T*(and the industrial city, such as Manchester became, to exist.[66] )Tj
T*( [edit] Involvement with coinage )Tj
T*( By 1786, two-thirds of the coins in circulation in Britain were counterfeit, )Tj
T*(and the Royal Mint responded by shutting itself down, worsening the )Tj
T*(situation.[67] Few of the silver coins being passed were genuine. Even the )Tj
T*(copper coins were melted down and replaced with lightweight fakes. The Royal )Tj
T*(Mint struck no copper coins for 48¬†years, from 1773 until 1821. The resultant )Tj
T*(gap was filled with copper tokens that approximated the size of the halfpenny, )Tj
T*(struck on behalf of merchants. Boulton struck millions of these merchant )Tj
T*(pieces.[70] On the rare occasions when the Royal Mint did strike coins, they )Tj
T*(were relatively crude, with quality control nonexistent.[67] )Tj
T*( Boulton had turned his attention to coinage in the mid 1780s; they were just )Tj
T*(another small metal product like those he manufactured.[67] He also had shares )Tj
T*(in several Cornish copper mines, and had a large personal stock of copper, )Tj
T*(purchased when the mines were unable to dispose of it elsewhere. However, when )Tj
T*(orders for counterfeit money were sent to him, he refused them: "I will do )Tj
T*(anything, short of being a common informer against particular persons, to stop )Tj
T*(the malpractices of the Birmingham coiners." In 1788 he established the Soho )Tj
T*(Mint as part of his industrial plant. The mint included eight steam-driven )Tj
T*(presses, each striking between 70 and 84 coins per minute. The firm had little )Tj
T*(immediate success getting a license to strike British coins, but was soon )Tj
T*(engaged in striking coins for the British East India Company for use in )Tj
T*(India.[67] )Tj
T*( The coin crisis in Britain continued. In a letter to the Master of the Mint, )Tj
T*(Lord Hawkesbury \(whose son would become Prime Minister as Earl of Liverpool\) on )Tj
T*(14 April 1789, Boulton wrote: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(In the course of my journeys, I observe that I receive upon an average )Tj
T*(two-thirds counterfeit halfpence for change at toll-gates, etc. and I believe )Tj
T*(the evil is daily increasing, as the spurious money is carried into circulation )Tj
T*(by the lowest class of manufacturers, who pay with it the principal part of the )Tj
T*(wages of the poor people they employ. They purchase from the subterraneous )Tj
T*(coiners 36 shillings'-worth of copper \(in nominal value\) for 20 shillings, so )Tj
T*(that the profit derived from the cheating is very large.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Boulton offered to strike new coins at a cost "not exceeding half the expense )Tj
T*(which the common copper coin hath always cost at his Majesty's Mint". He wrote )Tj
T*(to his friend, Sir Joseph Banks, describing the advantages of his coinage )Tj
T*(presses: )Tj

T*(diameter, and exactly concentric with the edge, which cannot be done by any )Tj
T*(other machinery now in use.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Boulton spent much time in London lobbying for a contract to strike British )Tj
T*(coins, but in June 1790 the Pitt Government postponed a decision on recoinage )Tj
T*(indefinitely. Meanwhile, the Soho Mint struck coins for the East India Company, )Tj
T*(Sierra Leone and Russia, while producing high-quality planchets, or blank )Tj
T*(coins, to be struck by national mints elsewhere.[67] The firm sent over 20 )Tj
T*(million blanks to Philadelphia, to be struck into cents and half-cents by the )Tj
T*(United States Mint‚ÄîMint Director Elias Boudinot found them to be "perfect and )Tj
T*(beautifully polished".[67] The high-technology Soho Mint gained increasing and )Tj
T*(somewhat unwelcome attention: rivals attempted industrial espionage, while )Tj
T*(lobbying for Boulton's mint to be shut down.[67] )Tj
T*( The national financial crisis reached its nadir in February 1797, when the )Tj
T*(Bank of England stopped redeeming its bills for gold. In an effort to get more )Tj
T*(money into circulation, the Government adopted a plan to issue large quantities )Tj
T*(of copper coins, and Lord Hawkesbury summoned Boulton to London on 3 March )Tj
T*(1797, informing him of the Government's plan. Four days later, Boulton attended )Tj
T*(a meeting of the Privy Council, and was awarded a contract at the end of the )Tj
T*(month. According to a proclamation dated 26 July 1797, King George III was )Tj
T*("graciously pleased to give directions that measures might be taken for an )Tj
T*(immediate supply of such copper coinage as might be best adapted to the payment )Tj
T*(of the laborious poor in the present exigency¬†...which should go and pass for )Tj
T*(one penny and two pennies".[76] The proclamation required that the coins weigh )Tj
T*(one and two ounces respectively, bringing the intrinsic value of the coins )Tj
T*(close to their face value.[76] Boulton made efforts to frustrate )Tj
T*(counterfeiters. Designed by Heinrich K√ºchler, the coins featured a raised rim )Tj
T*(with incuse or sunken letters and numbers, features difficult for )Tj
T*(counterfeiters to match.[67] The twopenny coins measured exactly an inch and a )Tj
T*(half across; 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet.[67] The exact )Tj
T*(measurements and weights made it easy to detect lightweight counterfeits. )Tj
T*(K√ºchler also designed proportionate halfpennies and farthings; these were not )Tj
T*(authorised by the proclamation, and though pattern pieces were struck, they )Tj
T*(never officially entered circulation. The halfpenny measured ten to a foot, the )Tj
T*(farthing 12 to a foot.[67] The coins were nicknamed "cartwheels", both because )Tj
T*(of the size of the twopenny coin and in reference to the broad rims of both )Tj
T*(denominations. The penny was the first of its denomination to be struck in )Tj
T*(copper. )Tj
T*( The cartwheel twopenny coin was not struck again; much of the mintage was )Tj
T*(melted down in 1800 when the price of copper increased and it had proved too )Tj
T*(heavy for commerce and was difficult to strike. Much to Boulton's chagrin, the )Tj
T*(new coins were being counterfeited in copper-covered lead within a month of )Tj
T*(issuance. Boulton was awarded additional contracts in 1799 and 1806, each for )Tj
T*(the lower three copper denominations. Though the cartwheel design was used )Tj
T*(again for the 1799 penny \(struck with the date 1797\), all other strikings used )Tj
T*(lighter planchets to reflect the rise in the price of copper, and featured more )Tj
T*(conventional designs. Boulton greatly reduced the counterfeiting problem by )Tj
T*(adding lines to the coin edges, and striking slightly concave planchets. )Tj
T*(Counterfeiters turned their sights to easier targets, the pre-Soho pieces, )Tj
T*(which were not withdrawn, due to the expense, until a gradual withdrawal took )Tj
T*(place between 1814 and 1817. )Tj
T*( Watt, in his eulogy after Boulton's 1809 death, stated: )Tj

T*( )Tj
T*( [edit] Activities and views )Tj
T*( [edit] Scientific studies and the Lunar Society )Tj
T*( Main article: Lunar Society )Tj
T*( Boulton never had any formal schooling in science. His associate and fellow )Tj
T*(Lunar Society member James Keir eulogised him after his death: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Mr. [Boulton] is proof of how much scientific knowledge may be acquired without )Tj
T*(much regular study, by means of a quick &amp; just apprehension, much practical )Tj
T*(application, and nice mechanical feelings. He had very correct notions of the )Tj
T*(several branches of natural philosophy, was master of every metallic art &amp; )Tj
T*(possessed all the chemistry that had any relations to the object of his various )Tj
T*(manufactures. Electricity and astronomy were at one time among his favourite )Tj
T*(amusements.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( From an early age, Boulton had interested himself in the scientific advances )Tj
T*(of his times. He discarded theories that electricity was a manifestation of the )Tj
T*(human soul, writing "we know tis matter &amp; tis wrong to call it Spirit". He )Tj
T*(called such theories "Cymeras [chimeras] of each others Brain". His interest )Tj
T*(brought him into contact with other enthusiasts such as John Whitehurst, who )Tj
T*(also became a member of the Lunar Society. In 1758 the Pennsylvania printer )Tj
T*(Benjamin Franklin, the leading experimenter in electricity, journeyed to )Tj
T*(Birmingham during one of his lengthy stays in Britain; Boulton met him, and )Tj
T*(introduced him to his friends. Boulton worked with Franklin in efforts to )Tj
T*(contain electricity within a Leyden jar, and when the printer needed new glass )Tj
T*(for his "glassychord" \(a mechanised version of musical glasses\) he obtained it )Tj
T*(from Boulton. )Tj
T*( Despite time constraints imposed on him by the expansion of his business, )Tj
T*(Boulton continued his "philosophical" work \(as scientific experimentation was )Tj
T*(then called\). He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and )Tj
T*(boiling point of mercury, on people's pulse rates at different ages, on the )Tj
T*(movements of the planets, and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink. )Tj
T*(However, Erasmus Darwin, another fellow enthusiast who became a member of the )Tj
T*(Lunar Society, wrote to him in 1763, "As you are now become a sober plodding )Tj
T*(Man of Business, I scarcely dare trouble you to do me a favour in the¬†... )Tj
T*(philosophical way." )Tj
T*( The Birmingham enthusiasts, including Boulton, Whitehurst, Keir, Darwin, Watt )Tj
T*(\(after his move to Birmingham\), potter Josiah Wedgwood and clergyman and )Tj
T*(chemist Joseph Priestley began to meet informally in the late 1750s. This )Tj
T*(evolved into a monthly meeting near the full moon, providing light to journey )Tj
T*(home afterwards, a pattern common for clubs in Britain at the time. The group )Tj
T*(eventually dubbed itself the "Lunar Society", and following the death of member )Tj

T*(voyage on which he was killed almost three years later, and Boulton's records )Tj
T*(show no further mention of the instrument. )Tj
T*( In addition to the scientific discussions and experiments conducted by the )Tj
T*(group, Boulton had a business relationship with some of the members. Watt and )Tj
T*(Boulton were partners for a quarter century. Boulton purchased vases from )Tj
T*(Wedgwood's pottery to be decorated with ormolu, and contemplated a partnership )Tj
T*(with him. Keir was a long-time supplier and associate of Boulton, though Keir )Tj
T*(never became his partner as he hoped. )Tj
T*( In 1785 both Boulton and Watt were elected as Fellows of the Royal Society. )Tj
T*(According to Whitehurst, who wrote to congratulate Boulton, not a single vote )Tj
T*(was cast against him. )Tj
T*( Though Boulton hoped his activities for the Lunar Society would "prevent the )Tj
T*(decline of a Society which I hope will be lasting", as members died or moved )Tj
T*(away they were not replaced. In 1813, four years after his death, the Society )Tj
T*(was dissolved and a lottery was held to dispose of its assets. Since there were )Tj
T*(no minutes of meetings, few details of the gatherings remain. Historian Jenny )Tj
T*(Uglow wrote of the lasting impact of the Society: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The Lunar Society['s]¬†... members have been called the fathers of the )Tj
T*(Industrial Revolution¬†... [T]he importance of this particular Society stems )Tj
T*(from its pioneering work in experimental chemistry, physics, engineering, and )Tj
T*(medicine, combined with leadership in manufacturing and commerce, and with )Tj
T*(political and social ideals. Its members were brilliant representatives of the )Tj
T*(informal scientific web which cut across class, blending the inherited skills )Tj
T*(of craftsmen with the theoretical advances of scholars, a key factor in )Tj
T*(Britain's leap ahead of the rest of Europe.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( Boulton was widely involved in civic activities in Birmingham. His friend Dr )Tj
T*(John Ash had long sought to build a hospital in the town. A great fan of the )Tj
T*(music of Handel, Boulton conceived of the idea to hold a music festival in )Tj
T*(Birmingham to raise funds for the hospital. The festival took place in )Tj
T*(September 1768, the first of a series stretching well into the twentieth )Tj
T*(century. The hospital opened in 1779. Boulton also helped build the General )Tj
T*(Dispensary, where outpatient treatment could be obtained. A firm supporter of )Tj
T*(the Dispensary, he served as treasurer, and wrote, "If the funds of the )Tj
T*(institution are not sufficient for its support, I will make up the deficiency." )Tj
T*(The Dispensary soon outgrew its original quarters, and a new building in Temple )Tj
T*(Row was opened in 1808, shortly before Boulton's death. )Tj
T*( Boulton helped found the New Street Theatre in 1774, and later wrote that )Tj
T*(having a theatre encouraged well-to-do visitors to come to Birmingham, and to )Tj
T*(spend more money than they would have otherwise. Boulton attempted to have the )Tj
T*(theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent, entitled to present )Tj
T*(serious drama; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807. He also supported )Tj
T*(Birmingham's Oratorio Choral Society, and collaborated with button maker and )Tj
T*(amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in )Tj
T*(1799. He maintained a pew at St Paul's Church, Birmingham, a centre of musical )Tj
T*(excellence. When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster )Tj
T*(Abbey in 1784 in the \(incorrect\) belief it was the centennial of Handel's birth )Tj
T*(and the \(correct\) belief that it was the 25th¬†anniversary of his death, Boulton )Tj
T*(attended and wrote, "I scarcely know which was grandest, the sounds or the )Tj
T*(scene. Both was transcendibly fine that it is not in my power of words to )Tj
T*(describe. In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body." )Tj
T*( Concerned about the level of crime in Birmingham, Boulton complained, "The )Tj
T*(streets are infested from Noon Day to midnight with prostitutes." In an era )Tj
T*(prior to the establishment of the police, Boulton served on a committee to )Tj
T*(organise volunteers to patrol the streets at night and reduce crime. He )Tj
T*(supported the local militia, providing money for weapons. In 1794 he was )Tj
T*(elected High Sheriff of Staffordshire, his county of residence. )Tj
T*( Besides seeking to improve local life, Boulton took an interest in world )Tj
T*(affairs. Initially sympathetic to the cause of the rebellious American )Tj

T*(colonists, Boulton changed his view once he realised that an independent )Tj
T*(America might be a threat to British trade, and in 1775 organised a petition )Tj
T*(urging the government to take a hard line with the Americans‚Äîthough when the )Tj
T*(revolution proved successful, he resumed trade with the former colonies. He was )Tj
T*(more sympathetic to the cause of the French Revolution, believing it justified, )Tj
T*(though he expressed his horror at the bloody excesses of the Revolutionary )Tj
T*(government. When war with France broke out, he paid for weapons for a company )Tj
T*(of volunteers, sworn to resist any French invasion. )Tj
T*( [edit] Family and later life, death, and memorials )Tj
T*( When Boulton was widowed in 1783 he was left with the care of his two teenage )Tj
T*(children. Neither his son Matthew Robinson Boulton nor his daughter Anne )Tj
T*(enjoyed robust health; the younger Matthew was often ill and was a poor student )Tj
T*(who was shuttled from school to school until he joined his father's business in )Tj
T*(1790; Anne suffered from a diseased leg that prevented her from enjoying a full )Tj
T*(life. Despite his lengthy absences on business, Boulton cared deeply for his )Tj
T*(family. He wrote to his wife in January 1780, )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(Nothing could in the least palliate this long, this cold, this very distant )Tj
T*(separation from my dearest wife and children but the certain knowledge that I )Tj
T*(am preparing for their ease, happiness and prosperity, and when that is the )Tj
T*(prise, I know no hardships that I would not encounter with, to obtain it.)Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( With the expiry of the patent in 1800 both Boulton and Watt retired from the )Tj
T*(partnership, each turning over his role to his namesake son. The two sons made )Tj
T*(changes, quickly ending public tours of the Soho Manufactory in which the elder )Tj
T*(Boulton had taken pride throughout his time in Soho. In retirement Boulton )Tj
T*(remained active, continuing to run the Soho Mint. When a new Royal Mint was )Tj
T*(built on Tower Hill in 1805, Boulton was awarded the contract to equip it with )Tj
T*(modern machinery. His continued activity distressed Watt, who had entirely )Tj
T*(retired from Soho, and who wrote to Boulton in 1804, "[Y]our friends fear much )Tj
T*(that your necessary attention to the operation of the coinage may injure your )Tj
T*(health". )Tj
T*( Boulton helped deal with the shortage of silver, persuading the Government to )Tj
T*(let him overstrike the Bank of England's large stock of Spanish dollars with an )Tj
T*(English design. The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by )Tj
T*(countermarking the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small )Tj
T*(image of George III, but the public was reluctant to accept them, in part due )Tj
T*(to counterfeiting.[108] This attempt inspired the couplet, "The Bank to make )Tj
T*(their Spanish Dollars pass/Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an )Tj
T*(ass."[108] Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking.[108] Though )Tj
T*(Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped \(high )Tj
T*(quality fakes arrived at the Bank's offices within days of the issuance\), these )Tj
T*(coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver )Tj
T*(coin in 1816, when Boulton's were withdrawn. He oversaw the final issue of his )Tj
T*(coppers for Britain in 1806, and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in )Tj
T*(Ireland. Even as his health failed, he had his servants carry him from Soho )Tj
T*(House to the Soho Mint, and he sat and watched the machinery,which was kept )Tj
T*(exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost 90,000,000 pieces for the )Tj
T*(East India Company. He wrote, "Of all the mechanical subjects I ever entered )Tj
T*(upon, there is none in which I ever engaged with so much ardour as that of )Tj
T*(bringing to perfection the art of coining." )Tj
T*( By early 1809 he was seriously ill. He had long suffered from kidney stones, )Tj
T*(which also lodged in the bladder, causing him great pain. He died at Soho House )Tj
T*(on 17 August 1809. He was buried in the graveyard of St. Mary's Church, )Tj
T*(Handsworth, in Birmingham¬†‚Äì the church was later extended over the site of his )Tj
T*(grave. Inside the church, on the north wall of the sanctuary, is a large marble )Tj
T*(monument to him, commissioned by his son, sculpted by the sculptor John )Tj
T*(Flaxman.[113] It includes a marble bust of Boulton, set in a circular opening )Tj

T*( God Hates Us All is the ninth studio album by American thrash metal band )Tj
T*(Slayer. Released on September 11, 2001, the album received positive critical )Tj
T*(reviews and entered the Billboard 200 at number 28. It was recorded in three )Tj
T*(months at The Warehouse Studio in Canada, and includes the Grammy )Tj
T*(Award-nominated "Disciple". The album is the band's last to feature drummer )Tj
T*(Paul Bostaph. Guitarist Kerry King wrote the majority of the lyrics, taking a )Tj

T*( Slayer began writing lyrics for a new album prior to their appearance at the )Tj
T*(1999 Ozzfest. However, every three to four months the band was distracted by )Tj
T*(commitments to Ozzfest, and worldwide "Tattoo the Earth" tour with Slipknot.[1] )Tj
T*(Guitarist Jeff Hanneman later admitted "that was the last break. Then we got )Tj
T*(our shit together."[2] The band's longtime producer, Rick Rubin, was too busy )Tj
T*(to work with Slayer, and felt "burned out"‚Äîunable to create intense music.[1] )Tj
T*(Araya and King had similar feelings about Rubin, and King remarked he "wanted )Tj

T*(according to Hanneman.[1] The band gave second candidate, Matt Hyde, a trial on )Tj
T*(the song "Bloodline", which appeared in the movie Dracula 2000. The band was )Tj

T*(years prior to the release of God Hates Us All, appearing on the compilation )Tj
T*(album WCW Mayhem: The Music in 1999, and then used as the opening theme for WCW )Tj
T*(Thunder from February 16, 2000 to the final episode on March 21, 2001. )Tj
T*( God Hates Us All was to be recorded in a Hollywood studio; however, the band )Tj
T*(relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia due to the availability of cheaper )Tj
T*(studio time. Hyde recommended a studio to the band‚ÄîThe Warehouse Studio \(owned )Tj
T*(by Bryan Adams\) as he had previously worked there.[4] The studio was altered to )Tj
T*(make it "feel like home" for Slayer; as opposed to the setting for, in King's )Tj
T*(words, the "lightweight Canadian pop singer". This consisted of adding incense )Tj
T*(burners, candles, dimmed lights and pornography on the walls. Two banner flags )Tj
T*(of two middle fingers were also hung up. Vocalist Tom Araya says "that was )Tj
T*(basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one )Tj
T*(of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That's the kind of shit we put up. )Tj
T*(Spooky stuff that makes you feel at home."[2] )Tj
T*( Hyde used the digital audio workstation Pro Tools during the engineering, )Tj
T*(production, and audio mixing stages of the album. Slayer members wanted to keep )Tj
T*(the use of computer effects to a minimum, only to include a small amount of )Tj
T*(delay and distortion.[1] As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were )Tj
T*(recorded first. Drummer Paul Bostaph follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin )Tj
T*(when in the studio: "The perfect take is the one that felt like it was going to )Tj
T*(fall apart but never did." Seven-string guitars were used on the tracks )Tj
T*("Warzone" and "Here Comes the Pain," the first time Slayer had done so. King )Tj
T*(was at the B.C. Rich guitar company \(manufacturer of his signature model, the )Tj
T*(KKV\) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King )Tj
T*(ordered a seven string as he thought "there's no point having one tuning for )Tj
T*(just one song," so he wrote another, going on to comment "you don't have to be )Tj
T*(good to make up a seven-string riff."[2] So there are two 7-string tunings, 4 )Tj
T*(songs dropped to B and the rest in D#.[4] )Tj
T*( [edit] Lyrical themes )Tj
T*( God Hates Us All explores such themes as religion, murder, revenge, and )Tj
T*(self-control. King wrote a majority of the lyrics, which he based on "street" )Tj
T*(subjects which everyone could relate to, rather than "Satan this," "Satan )Tj
T*(that," and "the usual Dungeons &amp; Dragons shit" from the band's previous )Tj
T*(records.[2] King told Guitar World: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(I definitely wanted to put more realism in it, more depth. God Hates Us All )Tj
T*(isn't an anti-Christian line as much as it's an idea I think a lot of people )Tj
T*(can relate to on a daily basis. One day you're living your life, and then )Tj
T*(you're hit by a car or your dog dies, so you feel like, "God really hates me )Tj
T*(today."[3])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The song "Threshold" is about reaching one's limit with a person in a )Tj
T*(situation where one is about to break‚Äîand are about to blow up as they get )Tj
T*("under your skin", while "Cast Down" features a fallen Angel who falls into )Tj
T*(drugs.[2] "God Send Death" is based on a creature that killed in the past, )Tj
T*(while "Deviance" takes up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs )Tj
T*(were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman )Tj
T*(came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really "pissed him )Tj
T*(off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. )Tj
T*(He later admitted he was trying to get into that person's mind; "why do they )Tj
T*(get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and )Tj
T*(getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset."[5] )Tj
T*( While other members went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading )Tj
T*(factual books regarding serial killers, including Gordon Burn's Happy Like )Tj
T*(Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West. Araya was seeking inspiration, )Tj
T*(and aimed to sound convincing while singing the lyrics, avoiding himself to )Tj
T*(sound like a gimmick.[2] Araya sang the lyrics more "over-the-top" than done on )Tj
T*(previous albums, as King's writing style is more "aggro."[3] This resulted in )Tj
T*(Kerrang! reviewer Jason Arnopp describing the album's lyrics as "so packed with )Tj

T*(foul and abusive language that it sounds as if D-12 and the Sopranos family )Tj
T*(were going head-to-head in a celebrity swearathon."[6] )Tj
T*( [edit] Cover art and album title )Tj
T*( God Hates Us All was originally intended to be named Soundtrack to the )Tj
T*(Apocalypse. However, Araya suggested that the title would be better used for a )Tj
T*(box set, which the band released in 2003.[7] The phrase God Hates Us All )Tj
T*(originates from the song "Disciple", during which the line is repeated over the )Tj
T*(chorus. The lyrics are in reference to God's allowance of acts such as suicide )Tj
T*(and terrorism, while seemingly doing nothing to prevent them[1][4] \(see problem )Tj
T*(of evil\). A member of the heavy metal band Pantera suggested using "God Hates )Tj
T*(Us All" for a shirt design after King played the song to the band. King agreed, )Tj
T*(although he thought the phrase would have more impact as the album title.[8] )Tj
T*( The original album cover depicts a Bible spiked with nails placed in a )Tj
T*(pentagram star shape, covered in blood with the word "Slayer" burnt across it, )Tj
T*(while the liner notes feature Bible verses crossed out with a black marker. The )Tj
T*(idea was suggested by the band's record company, although King wanted more time )Tj
T*(to develop a better cover. He complained that the idea was typical of "a record )Tj
T*(company with absolutely no idea what the fuck they were going to do", and said )Tj
T*(that the cover "looked like a seventh grader defaced the Bible." King's concept )Tj
T*(for the cover was to show nails in the shape of a pentagram, and have them miss )Tj
T*(keywords in Bible verses so it appeared as if it had been created by a )Tj
T*(sociopath who knew where every word appears. A slip insert was placed in front )Tj
T*(of the covers in major retail outlets.[9] )Tj
T*( [edit] Reception )Tj
T*( God Hates Us All was set for release on July 10; however, concerns regarding )Tj
T*(audio mixing, the album cover, and the band's label‚ÄîAmerican )Tj
T*(Recordings‚Äîchanging distributor, caused the release date to be delayed until )Tj
T*(September 11, 2001.[21] The release drew an unintended connection to the )Tj
T*(September 11 attacks, which was the second time Slayer caused controversy )Tj
T*(towards one of their releases‚Äîthe video for "Seasons in the Abyss" was filmed )Tj
T*(in Egypt and released prior to the Gulf War.[4] In its week of release, God )Tj
T*(Hates Us All debuted at number 28 on the Billboard 200,[22] and sold 51,000 )Tj
T*(copies.[23] It entered the Canadian Albums Chart at number 9, and debuted at )Tj
T*(number 18 on the top Internet album chart.[24] As of August 16, 2006 the album )Tj
T*(has sold 304,000 copies in the United States.[23] )Tj
T*( God Hates us All received generally positive reviews from music critics. On )Tj
T*(Metacritic, the album has a score of 80 out of 100 based on 12 )Tj
T*(reviews.[10]Kerrang!'s Jason Arnopp described the album as "easily Slayer's )Tj
T*(most convincing collection since Seasons in the Abyss," awarding the album five )Tj
T*(out of five.[6]Rolling Stone's Rob Kemp wrote the record was "Slayer's most )Tj
T*(brutal record since 1986's immortal \(or undead\) Reign in Blood," describing the )Tj
T*(music as "galloping double-bass-drum salvos" which "switch on a dime to furious )Tj
T*(double-time pummeling, as ominous power chords and jagged shred solos slice and )Tj
T*(dice with Formula One precision." Kemp awarded the album three and a half out )Tj
T*(of five.[18]AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier commented that "nearly 20 years )Tj
T*(into their evolution, Slayer have abandoned the extravagancies and )Tj
T*(accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returned to perfect the )Tj
T*(raw approach of their early years. A near flawless album," and that Araya's )Tj
T*(performance possibly makes "the most exhausting Slayer album yet."[11] )Tj
T*( Not all critics were impressed with the album. Blabbermouth.net reviewer )Tj
T*(Borivoj Krgin dismissively labeled the album as "another failure on the band's )Tj
T*(part to take the initiative and reinvent themselves." Krgin described King as )Tj
T*("the weaker and less inventive of the two main songwriters" \(King and )Tj
T*(Hanneman\), feeling the album followed "a familiar direction that almost always )Tj
T*(sounds tired and forced" as a result of King being the album's main songwriter. )Tj
T*(Krgin also singled out Araya for criticism, and called the vocalist a "hollow )Tj
T*(shell of his former self, boasting a singing style that is monotonous, devoid )Tj
T*(of creativity and at times virtually unlistenable." Krgin awarded the record 6 )Tj
T*(out of 10, and ended the review by observing that "Slayer's rapidly diminishing )Tj
T*(record sales \(Diabolus In Musica has shifted less than 300,000 copies in the US )Tj

T*(compared to 600‚Äì700,000+\) as a sign that the band is in dire need of a new )Tj
T*(lease on life."[25]The Washington Post gave it a mixed review, stating, "Of )Tj
T*(course, what Slayer says isn't supposed to be nearly as important as how it )Tj
T*(says it: The riffs are all overdriven and suffocating, and that's a conscious )Tj
T*(decision. In its simplest form, a song like "Exile" could pass for Motorhead )Tj
T*(pushed through the blades of a lawn mower, but that's selling Slayer short; )Tj
T*(guitarist Kerry King actively fights the groove that naturally comes from )Tj
T*(playing heavy rock-and-roll."[26] )Tj
T*( The song "Disciple" received a Grammy Award nomination for "Best Metal )Tj
T*(Performance" at the 44th Grammy Awards, the band's first nomination. The )Tj
T*(members cared neither about the nomination nor the award ceremony, and although )Tj
T*(they did not expect to win, thought it was "cool" to be nominated.[27] The )Tj
T*(ceremony took place on February 27, 2002, with Tool winning the award for their )Tj
T*(song "Schism".[28] )Tj
T*( [edit] Bostaph's departure )Tj
T*( Prior to Christmas 2001, Bostaph sustained a chronic elbow injury which )Tj
T*(hindered his ability to drum, resulting in his decision to leave the band.[29] )Tj
T*(His third-to-last performance with Slayer was recorded on War at the Warfield. )Tj
T*(To date, Bostaph has not viewed the footage; he has likened the experience to )Tj
T*("breaking up with a girlfriend," and wants to move on with his life.[30] )Tj
T*(Bostaph does not regret his time spent with the band, and describes the period )Tj
T*(as a high point in his career.[31] Without a drummer the band were unable to )Tj
T*(finish their God Hates Us All tour. King contacted original drummer Dave )Tj
T*(Lombardo almost ten years after his departure, and asked him if he would be )Tj
T*(willing to play for the remainder of the tour.[32] Lombardo accepted the offer, )Tj
T*(and played for the remaining 21 shows; however, he did not take on a permanent )Tj
T*(position with the band.[31] )Tj
T*( Following the tour, the band continued their search for a permanent drummer, )Tj
T*(and sought solicitation via demo tape and snail mail. Interested fans sent )Tj
T*(video recordings of renditions of the songs "Disciple," "God Send Death," )Tj
T*("Stain of Mind," "Angel of Death", "Postmortem/Raining Blood," "South of )Tj
T*(Heaven," "War Ensemble," and "Seasons in the Abyss"; complete with r√©sum√©s.[33] )Tj
T*(The band listened to hundreds of demo tapes, and created a "good pile" and )Tj
T*("ungood pile," though the "ungood" was much larger. Those whose performances )Tj
T*(the band were pleased with were offered an audition in Dallas, San Francisco or )Tj
T*(Peoria, Illinois; many applicants, however, were unable to attend due to flight )Tj
T*(costs. The band auditioned roughly two to three drummers a day, and their top )Tj
T*(choice was one of Lombardo's recommendations.[27] However, the band ultimately )Tj
T*(returned to Lombardo after deciding that they could not find a drummer who )Tj
T*(suited the job; Lombardo re-joined Slayer and attended music festivals )Tj
T*(worldwide to promote God Hates Us All and record drums on the 2006 album Christ )Tj

T*( Lake Burley Griffin is an artificial lake in the centre of Canberra, the )Tj
T*(capital of Australia. It was completed in 1963 after the Molonglo River‚Äîwhich )Tj
T*(ran between the city centre and Parliamentary Triangle‚Äîwas dammed. It is named )Tj
T*(after Walter Burley Griffin, the American architect who won the competition to )Tj
T*(design the city of Canberra.[2] )Tj
T*( Griffin designed the lake with many geometric motifs, so that the axes of his )Tj
T*(design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, )Tj
T*(government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was )Tj
T*(completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as )Tj
T*(the Great Depression and World War II intervened, and it was not until the )Tj
T*(1950s that planning resumed. After much political dispute over several proposed )Tj
T*(variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime )Tj
T*(Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams )Tj
T*(were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water )Tj
T*(level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 )Tj
T*(October 1964. )Tj
T*( The lake is located in the approximate geographic centre of the city, and is )Tj
T*(the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin's original designs. )Tj
T*(Numerous important institutions, such as the National Gallery, National Museum, )Tj
T*(National Library, Australian National University and the High Court were built )Tj
T*(on its shores, and Parliament House is a short distance away. Its surrounds, )Tj
T*(consisting mainly of parklands, are popular with recreational users, )Tj
T*(particularly in the warmer months. Though swimming in the lake is uncommon, it )Tj
T*(is used for a wide variety of other activities, such as rowing, fishing, and )Tj
T*(sailing. )Tj
T*( The lake is an ornamental body with a length of 11 kilometres \(6.8¬†mi\); at its )Tj
T*(widest, it measures 1.2 kilometres \(0.75¬†mi\). It has an average depth of 4 )Tj
T*(metres \(13¬†ft\) and a maximum depth of about 18 metres \(59¬†ft\) near the )Tj
T*(Scrivener Dam. Its flow is regulated by the 33-metre \(108¬†ft\) tall Scrivener )Tj
T*(Dam, designed to handle floods that occur once in 5,000 years. In times of )Tj
T*(drought, water levels can be maintained through the release of water from )Tj
T*(Googong Dam, located on an upstream tributary of the Molonglo River. )Tj
T*( [edit] Design history )Tj
T*( Charles Robert Scrivener \(1855‚Äì1923\) recommended the site for Canberra in )Tj
T*(1909, which was to be a planned capital city for the country. One of the )Tj
T*(reasons for the location's selection was its ability to store water "for )Tj
T*(ornamental purposes at reasonable cost";[3] Scrivener's work had demonstrated )Tj
T*(that the topography could be used to create a lake through flooding.[4] )Tj
T*( In 1911, a competition for the design of Canberra was launched, and )Tj
T*(Scrivener's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing )Tj
T*(architects.[3] The Molonglo River flowed through the site, which was a flood )Tj
T*(plain[5] and Scrivener's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an )Tj
T*(artificial lake‚Äîsimilar to the lake later created‚Äîand four possible locations )Tj

T*( The American architect Walter Burley Griffin won the contest and was invited )Tj
T*(to Australia to oversee the construction of the nation's new capital after the )Tj
T*(judges' decision was ratified by King O'Malley, the Minister for Home )Tj
T*(Affairs.[4][8] Griffin's proposal, which had an abundance of geometric )Tj
T*(patterns, incorporated concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating )Tj
T*(from several radii.[9] )Tj
T*( His lake design was at the heart of the city and consisted of a Central Basin )Tj
T*(in the shape of circular segment, a West and East Basin, which were both )Tj
T*(approximately circular, and a West and East Lake, which were much larger and )Tj
T*(irregularly shaped, at either side of the system.[10] The East Lake was )Tj
T*(supposed to be 6 metres \(20¬†ft\) higher than the remaining components.[11] )Tj
T*(Griffin's proposal was "the grandest scheme submitted, yet it had an appealing )Tj
T*(simplicity and clarity.[4] )Tj
T*( The lakes were deliberately designed so that their orientation was related to )Tj
T*(various topographical landmarks in Canberra.[3][12] The lakes stretched from )Tj
T*(east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the )Tj
T*(central basin stretched from Capital Hill‚Äîthe future location of the new )Tj
T*(Parliament House on a mound on the southern side‚Äînorth northeast across the )Tj
T*(central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War )Tj
T*(Memorial \(although a casino was originally planned in its place\).[13] This was )Tj
T*(designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at )Tj
T*(the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi )Tj
T*(Peak.[12] )Tj
T*( The straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin was )Tj
T*(designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards Black )Tj
T*(Mountain,[12] the highest point in Canberra. A line parallel to the water axis, )Tj
T*(on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis.[14] The )Tj
T*(municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue, which linked City )Tj
T*(Hill in Civic Centre and Market Centre. Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue )Tj
T*(were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market )Tj
T*(Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges )Tj
T*(of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the )Tj
T*(Parliamentary Triangle, and was to form the centrepiece of Griffin's work.[14] )Tj
T*( Later, Scrivener, as part of a government design committee, was responsible )Tj
T*(for modifying Griffin's winning design.[4][15][16] He recommended changing the )Tj
T*(shape of the lake from Griffin's very geometric shapes to a much more organic )Tj
T*(one using a single dam, unlike Griffin's series of weirs.[4][17] Griffin )Tj
T*(lobbied for the retention of the pure geometry, saying that they were "one of )Tj
T*(the reasons d'etre of the ornamental waters", but he was overruled.[18] The new )Tj
T*(design included elements from several of the best design submissions and was )Tj
T*(widely criticised as being ugly. The new plan for the lake retained Griffin's )Tj
T*(three formal basins: east, central, and west, though in a more relaxed )Tj
T*(form.[2][17] )Tj
T*( Griffin entered into correspondence with the government over the plan and its )Tj
T*(alternatives, and he was invited to Canberra to discuss the matter.[19] Griffin )Tj
T*(arrived in August 1913 and was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and )Tj
T*(Construction for three years.[4][20] )Tj
T*( The plans were varied again in the following years, but the design of Lake )Tj
T*(Burley Griffin remained based largely on the original committee's plan.[21] It )Tj
T*(was later gazetted and legally protected by the federal parliament in 1926,[22] )Tj
T*(based on a 1918 plan.[11] However, Griffin had a strained working relationship )Tj
T*(with the Australian authorities and a lack of federal government funding meant )Tj
T*(that by the time he left in 1920, little significant work had been done on the )Tj
T*(city.[8][21] A 1920s proposal to reduce West Lake into a ribbon of water was )Tj
T*(made on the basis of flood safety. However, the Owen and Peake report of 1929 )Tj
T*(ruled that the original design was hydrologically sound.[11] )Tj
T*( [edit] Political disputes and modifications )Tj
T*( With the onset of the Great Depression, followed by World War II, development )Tj
T*(of the new capital was slow,[23] and in the decade after the end of the war, )Tj

T*(collection of buildings was deemed ugly.[24] Canberra was often derisively )Tj
T*(described as "several suburbs in search of a city".[25] )Tj
T*( During this time, the Molonglo River flowed through the flood basin, with only )Tj
T*(a small fraction of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan.[26] The centre of )Tj
T*(his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements‚Äîmostly )Tj
T*(wooden, temporary and ad hoc‚Äîon either side.[27] There was little evidence that )Tj
T*(Canberra was planned,[13] and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart )Tj
T*(of Griffin's plan was but a paddock.[13] Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton )Tj
T*(Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to )Tj
T*(become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing )Tj
T*(sport.[13] A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of )Tj
T*(central basin,[28] and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three )Tj
T*(decades earlier.[29] )Tj
T*( In 1950, the East Lake‚Äîthe largest component‚Äîwas eliminated upon the advice of )Tj
T*(the National Capital Planning and Development Committee \(NCPDC\).[30] Today, )Tj
T*(what would have been the East Lake corresponds to the suburb of Fyshwick. The )Tj
T*(rationale given was that around 1,700 acres \(690¬†ha\) of farmland would be )Tj
T*(submerged and that the Molonglo would have insufficient water to keep the lake )Tj
T*(filled.[30] )Tj
T*( In 1953, the NCPDC excised the West Lake from its plans and replaced it with a )Tj
T*(winding stream,[31] which was 110 metres \(360¬†ft\) wide and covered around a )Tj
T*(fifth of the original area.[32] As the NCPDC had only advisory powers, this )Tj
T*(change was attributed to the influence of senior officials in the Department of )Tj
T*(the Interior who felt that Griffin's plan was too grandiose.[33] Advocates of )Tj
T*(watered-down scheme thought it was more economical and saved 350 hectares \(860¬†)Tj
T*(acres\) of land for development.[32] However, according to engineering reports )Tj
T*(that were ignored, the smaller plan would actually cost more money and require )Tj
T*(a more complicated structure of dams that would in any case be less able to )Tj
T*(prevent flooding.[34][35] )Tj
T*( Initially, there was little opposition during the consultation period before )Tj
T*(the alterations were made.[32] However, opposition to the reduction of the )Tj
T*(water area grew.[31] The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised )Tj
T*(for being non-transparent and sneaky.[36] Some organisations complained that )Tj
T*(they were not given an opportunity to express their opinion before the change )Tj
T*(was gazetted,[37] and many politicians and the chief town planner were not )Tj
T*(informed.[38] Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members )Tj
T*(of the Royal Canberra Golf Club, whose course was situated on the location of )Tj
T*(the proposed West Lake, were responsible for the change in policy.[39] )Tj
T*( The Parliamentary Public Works Committee advised the Parliament to restore the )Tj
T*(West Lake.[31] After an inquiry in late 1954, it concluded that: )Tj
T*( )Tj
T*(The West Lake is desirable and practicable. It was eliminated from the Canberra )Tj
T*(plan by the Department of the Interior without adequate investigation by the )Tj
T*(National Capital Planning and Development Committee and replaced by a ribbon of )Tj
T*(water scheme involving a capitalised cost or nearly 3 million more. The lake )Tj
T*(should be restored to the plan, and the necessary Ministerial action is )Tj
T*(recommended as soon as possible.[40])Tj
T*( )Tj
T*( The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies,[41] regarded the state of the national )Tj
T*(capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of )Tj
T*(contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged )Tj
T*(with the development of the city, feeling that their performance lacked )Tj

T*( In 1958, the newly created National Capital Development Commission \(NCDC\), )Tj

T*(plans.[45] He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a )Tj
T*(segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal )Tj
T*(shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore.[46] The )Tj
T*(result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.[47] )Tj
T*( [edit] Final layout )Tj
T*( The lake contains 33,000,000 cubic metres \(27,000¬†acre¬∑ft\) of water with a )Tj
T*(surface area of 6.64 square kilometres \(2.56¬†sq¬†mi\). It is 11 kilometres \(6.8¬†)Tj

T*(40.5 kilometres \(25.2¬†mi\)[48][49] and a water level of 555.93 metres \(1,823.9¬†)Tj
T*(ft\) above sea level.[50] )Tj
T*( The lake is relatively shallow; the maximum depth is 17.6 metres \(58¬†ft\) near )Tj

T*(part of the complex in the East Basin, which has an average depth of 1.9 metres )Tj
T*(\(6.2¬†ft\). The minimum depth of the water at the walls is around 0.5 metres \(1.6¬†)Tj
T*(ft\) and rock is placed at the toe of the wall to inhibit aquatic plant )Tj
T*(growth.[4][50] )Tj
T*( Lake Burley Griffin contains six islands, three unnamed small islands and )Tj
T*(three larger named islands.[51] Of the larger islands, Aspen Island is located )Tj
T*(in Central Basin while Springbank and Spinnaker Island are located in the West )Tj
T*(Lake.[51] Aspen Island is connected to dry land by a footbridge,[52] and is the )Tj
T*(site of the Australian National Carillon.[53] )Tj
T*( [edit] Construction )Tj
T*( In 1958, engineers conducted studies into the hydrology and structural )Tj
T*(requirements needed for the building of the dam.[29] Further studies were done )Tj
T*(to model water quality, siltation, climate effects and change in land )Tj
T*(quality.[54] Modelling based on the data collection suggested that the water )Tj
T*(level could be kept within a metre of the intended level of 556 metres \(1,824¬†)Tj
T*(ft\) above sea level in the case of a flood.[55][56] )Tj
T*( In February 1959, formal authority for beginning construction was granted.[47] )Tj
T*(However, while Menzies was on holidays, some officials from the Department of )Tj
T*(Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so the )Tj
T*(start of the construction was delayed.[47] Once it started, progress was )Tj
T*(fast.[47] At its peak, the number of people physically working on the )Tj
T*(construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500.[55]John Overall, the )Tj
T*(Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished )Tj
T*(within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. )Tj
T*(Equipment was quickly requisitioned.[57] )Tj
T*( After the lengthy political wrangling over the design had passed, the )Tj
T*(criticism of the scheme died down. Menzies strongly denounced the "moaning" by )Tj
T*(opponents of the lake.[57] Most critics decried the project as a waste of money )Tj
T*(that should have been spent on essential services across Australia.[57] Less )Tj
T*(strident concerns centred on the potentially negative effects of the lake, such )Tj
T*(as mosquitoes, ecological degeneration,[57] siltation and the possibility that )Tj
T*(the lake would create fog.[56] The latter of these concerns has proven to be )Tj
T*(unfounded.[58] )Tj
T*( [edit] Lakes, islands and foreshore )Tj
T*( The excavation of Lake Burley Griffin began in 1960 with the clearing of )Tj
T*(vegetation from the floodplain of the Molonglo River. The trees on the golf )Tj

T*(grounds and houses.[59] )Tj
T*( During major earthworks, at least 382,000 cubic metres \(500,000¬†cu¬†yd\) of )Tj

T*( Care was taken to excavate the entire lake floor to a depth of at least 2 )Tj
T*(metres \(6.6¬†ft\) to provide sufficient clearance for boat keels. Another reason )Tj
T*(given for this was that mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such )Tj
T*(a depth.[60] A soil conservation program was launched in the catchment and bed )Tj
T*(load traps were installed to minimise loss of earth.[56] The traps have been )Tj
T*(used as a source of sand and gravel for building sites.[62] Drainage blankets )Tj
T*(were used to prevent the loss of groundwater beneath the lake.[63] )Tj
T*( During the following phase of work, four types of lake margin were )Tj
T*(constructed.[64] On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced )Tj
T*(concrete retaining walls were used,[51][64] while on the eastern side, grouted )Tj
T*(rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well as much of the East )Tj
T*(Basin.[51][64] Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside )Tj
T*(recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the )Tj
T*(lake complex.[51][64] Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water )Tj
T*(vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the )Tj
T*(West Lake in Yarralumla.[51][64] William Holford and Partners were responsible )Tj
T*(for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance )Tj
T*(with a detailed scheme.[4][63]Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the )Tj

T*( [edit] Bridges )Tj
T*( Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge \(310 metres¬†/ )Tj
T*(1,020 feet\),[60]Kings Avenue Bridge[60] \(270 metres¬†/ 890 feet[65]\) and a )Tj
T*(roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake )Tj
T*(was filled, and replaced wooden structures.[60] )Tj
T*( Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took )Tj
T*(place during late 1959 to early 1960.[55] The construction of the Kings Avenue )Tj
T*(Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year )Tj
T*(after.[60] Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the )Tj
T*(ground remained dry during construction.[55] Both bridges use post-tensioned )Tj
T*(concrete,[63] reinforced with rustproof steel cables.[66] )Tj
T*( Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway;[67][68] )Tj
T*(Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has )Tj
T*(two.[68][69] Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was )Tj
T*(illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known )Tj
T*(as "integral lighting".[70] The design was deemed a success, so it was )Tj
T*(introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards )Tj
T*(from the Illumination Engineering Society.[71] )Tj
T*( Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a )Tj
T*(ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of )Tj
T*(a large crowd.[60] Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an )Tj
T*(official ceremony. Menzies called it "the finest building in the national )Tj
T*(capital".[60] )Tj
T*( The dam that holds back the waters of Lake Burley Griffin was named Scrivener )Tj
T*(Dam after Charles Robert Scrivener.[47] The dam was designed and built by )Tj
T*(Rheinstahl Union Bruckenbau in West Germany,[60][64] and utilised )Tj
T*(state-of-the-art post-tensioning techniques to cope with any problems or )Tj
T*(movements in the riverbed.[55] This was required because of the quartz porphyry )Tj
T*(and geological faulting upon which the dam sits.[64] About 55,000 cubic metres )Tj
T*(\(72,000¬†cu¬†yd\) of concrete was used in its construction. The dam is 33 metres )Tj
T*(\(108¬†ft\) high and 319 metres \(1,047¬†ft\) long with a maximum wall thickness of )Tj

T*(event.[65] Construction began in September 1960 and the dam was locked in )Tj
T*(September 1963.[64] )Tj
T*( The dam has five bay spillway controlled by 30.5 metres \(100¬†ft\) )Tj

T*( [edit] Lake filling )Tj
T*( A prolonged drought coincided with and eased work on the lake's construction. )Tj
T*(The valves on the Scrivener Dam were closed on 20 September 1963 by Minister )Tj
T*(for the Interior, Gordon Freeth; Menzies was absent due to ill health.[72] )Tj
T*(Several months on, with no rain in sight, mosquito-infested pools of water were )Tj
T*(the only visible sign of the lake filling.[72] With the eventual breaking of )Tj
T*(the drought, the lake reached the planned level on 29 April 1964.[49] On 17 )Tj
T*(October 1964, Menzies \(by now Sir Robert\) commemorated the filling of the lake )Tj
T*(and the completion of stage one with an opening ceremony amid the backdrop of )Tj
T*(sailing craft.[49][73] The ceremony was accompanied by fireworks display, and )Tj
T*(Griffin's lake had finally come to fruition after five decades, at the cost of )Tj
T*(AUD5,039,050.[49][63] Freeth suggested that Menzies had "been in a material )Tj
T*(sense the father of the lake" and that the lake should be named after him.[74] )Tj
T*(Menzies insisted that the lake should be named after Griffin.[47] )Tj
T*( In times of severe drought, Lake Burley Griffin's water level can fall )Tj
T*(unacceptably low. When this happens, a release of water from Googong Dam )Tj
T*(located upstream can be scheduled to top up and restore the lake water )Tj
T*(level.[75] The Googong Dam is located on the Queanbeyan River which is a )Tj
T*(tributary of the Molonglo River.[76] The dam whose construction was finished in )Tj
T*(1979 is one of three dams‚Äîthe Cotter and Corin Dams are the others‚Äîthat meet )Tj
T*(the water supply needs of the Canberra and Queanbeyan region.[77] The Googong )Tj
T*(Dam's water carrying capacity is 124,500,000 cubic metres \(100,900¬†)Tj
T*(acre¬∑ft\).[76] )Tj
T*( [edit] Later history and development )Tj
T*( Griffin's design made the lake a focal point of the city. In the four decades )Tj
T*(since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national )Tj
T*(importance were added. According to the policy plan of the government, "The )Tj
T*(lake is not only one of the centrepieces of Canberra's plan in its own right, )Tj
T*(but forms the immediate foreground of the National Parliamentary Area."[48] )Tj
T*( The creation of the lake also gave a water frontage to many prominent )Tj
T*(institutions that were previously landlocked. The Royal Canberra Hospital was )Tj
T*(located on the Acton Peninsula between the West Lake and the West Basin on the )Tj
T*(north shore until its demolition.[78]Government House, the historic Blundell's )Tj
T*(Cottage‚Äîwhich was built over 50 years before construction of Canberra began‚Äîand )Tj
T*(the newly built Australian National University, on the southern and northern )Tj
T*(shores of the West Lake, both gained a waterfront.[78] )Tj
T*( In 1970, two tourist attractions were added to the middle of Central Basin. )Tj
T*(The Captain James Cook Memorial was built by the government to commemorate the )Tj
T*(Bicentenary of \(then Lieutenant\) James Cook's first sighting of the east coast )Tj
T*(of Australia. It includes a water jet fountain located in the central basin )Tj
T*(\(based on the Jet d'eau[79] in Geneva\) and a skeleton globe sculpture at )Tj
T*(Regatta Point showing the paths of Cook's expeditions. On 25 April 1970, Queen )Tj
T*(Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the memorial.[80] As part of the same )Tj
T*(ceremony, Queen Elizabeth also opened the National Carillon on Aspen Island, a )Tj
T*(set of 53 bronze bells donated by the British Government to commemorate the )Tj
T*(city's 50th anniversary.[53] )Tj
T*( The completion of the central basin placed a waterway between Parliament House )Tj

T*(was opened on the western side of the axis in April 1968.[82] Building of the )Tj
T*(High Court and National Gallery occurred in the late-1970s and the buildings )Tj
T*(were opened in May 1980 and October 1982 respectively.[83] The latter two )Tj
T*(buildings lie on the eastern side of the axis and are connected by an aerial )Tj
T*(bridge.[52][84] In 1988, the new Parliament House was built on Capital Hill, )Tj
T*(thereby completing the most important structure in the Parliamentary )Tj
T*(Triangle.[52] )Tj
T*( The current home of the National Museum was built on the former site of the )Tj
T*(Royal Canberra Hospital in 2001.[14][52] This occurred after the public were )Tj
T*(encouraged to watch the controlled demolition of the hospital in 1997, but a )Tj
T*(girl was killed by flying debris, leading to criticism of the ACT )Tj
T*(Government.[85] )Tj
T*( At the start of the 21st century, the layout of the lake was significantly )Tj
T*(altered for the first time since its construction, through the Kingston )Tj
T*(Foreshores Redevelopment on southern shore of the East Basin, which was planned )Tj
T*(in 1997.[86] A bidding process was enacted,[87] multi-million dollar luxury )Tj
T*(apartment complexes were built in the suburb of Kingston,[88] driving property )Tj
T*(values to record-breaking levels.[86] After a dispute over the environmental )Tj
T*(impact of the development, building works commenced on the previously )Tj
T*(industrial lakeside area of the suburb.[89][90] In 2007, work started to )Tj
T*(reclaim land from the lakebed to form a harbour, which is expected to turn the )Tj
T*(area into an entertainment hub.[86] )Tj
T*( The Kingston Powerhouse, which used to provide the city's power supply, was )Tj
T*(converted into the Canberra Glassworks in 2007, 50 years after the electricity )Tj
T*(generators stopped.[91] A 22-metre \(72¬†ft\) high tower of glass and light named )Tj
T*(Touching Lightly, will be built at Kingston after being approved by the )Tj
T*(government in April 2009. An environmentally friendly structure, it is expected )Tj
T*(to be completed in mid-2009.[92] )Tj
T*( In 2007, the government unveiled a proposal to redevelop the area surrounding )Tj
T*(the historic Albert Hall into a tourist and dining precinct. This included the )Tj
T*(building of an eight-storey building and the rezoning of some waterfront land )Tj
T*(currently designated as cultural to commercial.[93] It was met with widespread )Tj
T*(hostility from heritage activists and the general community, which submitted )Tj
T*(more than 3,300 signatories in a petition against the scheme.[94][95] One of )Tj
T*(the criticisms was that the project was tilted too heavily towards business, )Tj
T*(and neglected the arts and community events.[96] The proposal was scrapped in )Tj
T*(2009.[97][98][99] )Tj
T*( It has been proposed that a footbridge, to be named Immigration Bridge, be )Tj
T*(built between the National Museum of Australia and Lennox Gardens on the south )Tj
T*(shore, in recognition of the contributions that immigrants have made to )Tj
T*(Australia.[100] The proposal has mostly received negative feedback.[101] An )Tj
T*(inquiry recommended that the bridge be redesigned or moved to accommodate the )Tj
T*(needs of other lake users.[102] )Tj
T*( [edit] Lakeside recreation )Tj
T*( The surrounds of Lake Burley Griffin are very popular recreational areas. )Tj
T*(Public parks exist along most of the shore line, with free electric barbecue )Tj
T*(facilities, fenced-in swimming areas, picnic tables and toilets.[52] These )Tj
T*(parklands form a large part of the area around the lake, and occupy 3.139¬†km2 )Tj
T*(\(776¬†acres\) in total.[50] Some of the parks reserved for public recreation )Tj
T*(include Commonwealth, Weston, Kings and Grevillea Parks, Lennox Gardens and )Tj
T*(Commonwealth Place.[52] Commonwealth and Kings Park on the northern shore of )Tj
T*(the Central Basin are among the two most popular. The former is an urban )Tj

T*(Commonwealth Park is the location of Floriade, an annual flower festival that )Tj

T*(known for its woodland and conifers, while Black Mountain Peninsula is known as )Tj
T*(a picnicking site with eucalypts.[14] Grevillea and Bowen Parks on the East )Tj
T*(Basin tend to be little used.[78] )Tj
T*( Owing to the proliferation of beaches, boat ramps and jetties, the West Lake )Tj
T*(is the area most used by swimmers and vessels.[14] A bike path also surrounds )Tj
T*(the lake, and riding, walking or jogging around the lake are a popular activity )Tj
T*(on the weekends.[2][78][107] Fireworks are often held over the lake on New )Tj
T*(Year's Eve, and a large show called Skyfire has been held at the lake since )Tj
T*(1988.[108][109] )Tj
T*( [edit] Water sports )Tj
T*( Lake Burley Griffin, apart from being ornamental, is used for many )Tj
T*(recreational activities. Canoeing, sailing, paddleboating and windsurfing are )Tj
T*(popular.[78] A rowing course is set up at the western end of the lake.[110] The )Tj
T*(National Championships were held in the lake in 1964,[61] but high winds have )Tj
T*(deterred organisers. On one occasion, winds swept a boat into a bridge )Tj
T*(pylon.[111] While not particularly popular, opportunities for swimming have )Tj
T*(been limited recently because of increasingly frequent lake closures due to )Tj
T*(concerns about water quality;[112] another deterrent against swimming is the )Tj
T*(generally cold water temperature.[110][113] During summer, the lake is used for )Tj
T*(the swim leg of numerous triathlon and aquathlon events including the Sri )Tj
T*(Chinmoy Triathlon Festival.[114] )Tj
T*( Generally, powerboat use on the lake is not permitted. Permits are available )Tj
T*(for the use of powered boats on the lake for use in rescue, training, )Tj
T*(commercial purposes or special interest \(such as historic steam powered )Tj
T*(boats\).[115] Molonglo Reach, an area of the Molonglo River just before it )Tj
T*(enters the east basin is set aside for water skiing. Ten powerboats may be used )Tj
T*(in this limited area.[116] )Tj
T*( [edit] Safety )Tj
T*( The lake is patrolled by the Australian Federal Police water police.[49] The )Tj
T*(water police give assistance to lake users, helping to right boats and towing )Tj
T*(crippled craft to shore.[49] )Tj
T*( At most swimming locations around Lake Burley Griffin there are fenced-in )Tj
T*(swimming areas for safety. In the more popular areas, there are also safety )Tj
T*(lockers with life belts and emergency phones for requesting help. Between 1962 )Tj
T*(and 1991, seven people died from drowning.[117] )Tj
T*( For safety and water quality reasons, the lake has different zones for )Tj
T*(different activities.[118] The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact )Tj
T*(water activities such as swimming and water skiing.[118] The East and Central )Tj
T*(Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned for secondary contact water sports )Tj
T*(such as sailing or rowing.[118] West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the )Tj
T*(area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary )Tj
T*(recreational area of the lake, and both primary and secondary contact water )Tj
T*(sports are permitted.[118] Yarramundi Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked )Tj
T*(rowing course, and is zoned as secondary, although primary contact activities )Tj
T*(are also allowed.[118] )Tj
T*( [edit] Environmental issues )Tj
T*( [edit] Water quality )Tj
T*( Toxic blue-green algae blooms are a reasonably common occurrence in the )Tj
T*(lake.[119] Warnings about coming into contact with the water are released when )Tj
T*(an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of )Tj
T*(phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality.[120] )Tj
T*(Blue-green algae \(more correctly cyanobacteria\) produce toxins, which can be )Tj
T*(harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the )Tj
T*(contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after )Tj
T*(playing in and drinking the lake water.[121] )Tj
T*( The water also appears murky due to a high level of turbidity;[113] however, )Tj
T*(this is not usually a health risk.[113] However, the turbidity, which is caused )Tj
T*(by wind, prevents photosynthetic stabilisation.[122] Siltation is not )Tj

T*(is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong )Tj
T*(Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded,[119] partly due to )Tj
T*(the closure of some lead mines upstream.[58] However, leaching and groundwater )Tj
T*(leakage still causes some pollution.[58] Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have )Tj
T*(been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.[119] )Tj
T*( [edit] Aquatic life and fishing )Tj
T*( Fishing is quite popular in the lake. The most common species caught is the )Tj
T*(illegally introduced carp.[119] Annual monitoring is carried out to determine )Tj
T*(fish populations. However, a number of less common species also inhabit the )Tj
T*(lake, including native Murray cod, western carp gudgeon and silver perch, as )Tj
T*(well as introduced goldfish, Gambusia, rainbow trout and brown trout. [123] )Tj
T*( The lake has been stocked annually with a variety of introduced and native )Tj
T*(species and over half a million fish have been released since 1981.[124] There )Tj
T*(have been many changes to the fish populations in the lake as well as stocking )Tj
T*(practices since it was first filled.[124] )Tj
T*( Regular stocking since the start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable )Tj
T*(populations of golden perch and Murray cod;[124] native fish that were )Tj
T*(indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost )Tj
T*(to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th )Tj
T*(century.[125] The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the )Tj
T*(Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and )Tj
T*(habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and )Tj
T*(golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators )Tj
T*(of other fish.[125] )Tj
T*( Silver perch and brown trout were released in 1981‚Äì83 and 1987‚Äì89 )Tj
T*(respectively, but have not been stocked since.[124] Rainbow trout have been )Tj
T*(released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released )Tj
T*(since 2002‚Äì04,[124] due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a )Tj
T*(government report, the reason for the low survival rate is unknown, but the )Tj
T*(dominance of carp in the competition for food is one prominent theory.[124] )Tj
T*(Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the )Tj
T*(released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in )Tj
T*(the last five years.[124] The government plans to stock only these two species )Tj
T*(for the five years leading up to 2014.[126] )Tj
